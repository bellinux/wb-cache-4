5|$|After {{a period}} of absence, Carmella's mother sends Connor on a secret mission to find her daughter. He discovers that Carmella has become a nun, and is living in a convent as Sister Mary Catherine. During her time as a nun, she grows close to Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor), who {{encourages}} her to become a recording artist after hearing her sing. Carmella does it to make him happy, but admits {{that she does not}} really enjoy singing. She withdraws from their relationship as she feels that Ned is prying <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> her private affairs.|$|E
5|$|When O'Brien {{finally decided}} to write a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, she wanted the book to be more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis given on the singer's discography was unnecessary, instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E
25|$|Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with going <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> {{details in}} efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him {{to admit that they}} are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a {{composite}} of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.|$|E

25|$|The decisive {{pressure}} {{for a compromise}} solution on the Japanese side came from the Shōwa Emperor, who {{made it clear that}} he was displeased with the prospect of a war with Britain while the war with China was still unresolved and Japan on the brink of an all-out war with the Soviet Union. Additionally, he felt a war with Britain would push Japan <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the embrace of Germany to the latter's advantage. Since he was worshipped as a living god by the Japanese people, the knowledge of his unhappiness about the Tientsin crisis was a powerful force for a peaceful resolution of the crisis within the halls of power in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. Seeing that the generals and Hương were {{not willing to}} reinstate the HNC Taylor sent General John Throckmorton to meet the generals to mend fences. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals that they had read <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> Taylor's comments and that the U.S. {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power. Khánh appeared reassured by this and made a public statement on 30 December, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any tension that remained. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC.|$|E
500|$|... "I Love Lisa" [...] is {{the fifteenth}} episode of The Simpsons fourth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on February 11, 1993. In the episode, Lisa gives Ralph Wiggum a Valentine's Day card when she sees {{that he has not}} received any. Ralph reads <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> Lisa's gesture and, much to Lisa's dismay, relentlessly pursues her with affection. Lisa snaps at Ralph and angrily tells him they are not together and that she never liked him. Heartbroken, Ralph channels his feelings into his performance as George Washington in the school's President's Day pageant. After a thunderous applause from the audience, he is able to accept Lisa as just a friend.|$|E
50|$|The lowsider or lowside {{is a type}} of {{motorcycle}} crash usually {{occurring in}} a turn. It is caused when either the front or rear wheel slides out as a result of either <b>too</b> <b>much</b> braking <b>into</b> the corner, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> acceleration through or out of the corner, or <b>too</b> <b>much</b> speed carried <b>into</b> or through the corner for the available grip. It may also be caused by unexpected slippery or loose material (such as oil, water, dirt or gravel) on the road surface.|$|R

50|$|Michigan tied up {{the score}} with {{a field goal}} of its own, then Stanfield Wells scored a {{touchdown}} and Frederick L. Conklin kicked goal. Morrison scored a touchdown for Vanderbilt, but put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> energy <b>into</b> the kick-out and missed the crucial extra point.|$|R
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists {{could not}} help but search {{everywhere}} for meaning. He says of the windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises [...] "the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are [...] "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". Slive is more reluctant to read <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the [...] "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says [...] "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics on Here Come the Warm Jets are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} love affair with the man." [...] Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> his words; he claims that the song [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] was [...] "written in less time than it takes to sing... I regard [...] as an instrumental with singing on it".|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Russia, three British {{newspapers}} announced on 24 September 1906 that Michael was to marry Princess Patricia of Connaught, but neither he nor Patricia knew anything about it. Buckingham Palace issued a denial. Nevertheless, two years later, in October 1908, Michael visited London, and he and Patricia were [...] "paired" [...] at social engagements. It seems likely that Michael's mother was plotting to get him married to a more suitable bride and the originator of the false report, Reuters correspondent Guy Beringer, read <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the plans. Michael and Dina were planning to elope, but their plans were stymied as Dina was under surveillance by the Okhrana, Nicholas's secret police, and she was prevented from travelling. Under family pressure and unable to see Dina, by August 1907 Michael appeared to be losing interest. Dina went to live abroad. She never married and believed herself to be Michael's rightful fiancée, but their romance was over.|$|E
500|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. As the generals and Hương {{were unwilling to}} reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals they had read <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> Taylor's comments and that the US {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power with aid cuts. Cang appeared unimpressed, while Thiệu and Kỳ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks. Khánh appeared reassured by Throckmorton's overtures and made a public statement on December 30, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any remaining tension. He also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by Deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent so much on the country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. According to Karnow, for Khánh and his officers, [...] "their weakness was their strength". An anonymous South Vietnamese government official said [...] "Our big advantage over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do." ...|$|E
500|$|New York magazine's Amy Odell {{commented that}} [...] "The {{intricacy}} of her [...] wardrobe [...] suggests she's feeling the Gaga pressure." [...] She further added: [...] "In a burgeoning phenomenon {{we might call}} the Gaga Effect, divas everywhere may feel the pressure to push avant-garde fashion to the max {{to keep up with}} the pantsless wonder. Beyoncé's fashion efforts in 'Video Phone'— which make her epic diva money fan a mere distant memory— deserve a look-by-look analysis, because she tried really hard." [...] In another review, she said [...] "Together they play with colored fire-spitting water guns and look like the best of diva friends." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt commented that the video was [...] "B's show—La Gaga's just guesting in it." [...] Greenblatt also praised the fashion designs used in the video and the Bettie Page [...] "vibes". Spins Chris Zakorchemny felt that Gaga [...] "does her best Beyonce impression" [...] in the video for the song. However, he said that [...] "Even with Gaga involved, the Hype Williams-produced video doesn't veer <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the weird; it's certainly not Gaga-setting-men-on-fire weird." [...] Margaret Wappler of The Arizona Republic praised the video saying that it had [...] "electrifying color schemes and high-shine lighting, resulting in a fantastical pop mirage between Lady Gaga and Beyonce". She further called it a [...] "kinetic spectacle to behold, with enough guns to make Ted Nugent weep with jealousy and some hot Bettie Page bangs on Beyonce that should prompt plenty of ladies to run to the hairdresser". Wappler finished her review by concluding that [...] "the whole video has a distinct and not unpleasant 90s vibe." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video praising the outfits used in the video and the [...] "oversized sequined sweater that makes an appearance toward the end".|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few years}} a new problem arose. There was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> scrip and a {{shortage}} of babysitting. As new members joined, more scrip {{was added to the}} system until couples had <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but new members were not able to spend it because no one else wanted to babysit. In general, the cooperative experienced regular problems because the administration took in more than it spent, and at times the system added <b>too</b> <b>much</b> scrip <b>into</b> the system via the amount issued to new members.|$|R

50|$|The {{system has}} {{attracted}} {{support from a}} number of Government ministers including Peter Hain and Lord Falconer of Thoroton. It has however been criticised for being little more than a system of appointment as the closed list system it uses puts <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power <b>into</b> the hands of the political parties themselves. It also greatly disadvantages smaller parties who may not field candidates in all constituency seats.|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{the closure}} of the newspaper, The New York Sun web site renewed {{activity}} on April 28, 2009, prompting some observers to consider the possible implications.

5000|$|Reviewing {{the first}} two seasons of Animator Expo for Anime News Network, Kevin Cirugeda {{recommended}} the short [...] "with reservations."

2500|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} while both parties had {{relied heavily on}} the subtexts of {{statements}} made in the 1963 parliamentary debates, [...] "one should not read <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> [...] ". This was because the phrase shall be filled by election itself is inherently filled with ambiguity. The Court noted that no member of the ruling party, including the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, had ever denied there was a constitutional obligation to call a by-election to fill a casual vacancy. Instead, the 1963 debates had only focused on the time-frame within which such by-elections should be called.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the reports}} are hearsay in the {{technical}} sense, because their content is not produced live before the hearing examiner, {{we feel that the}} claimant and the Court of Appeals read <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>into</b> the single sentence from Consolidated Edison. The contrast the Chief Justice was drawing, at the very page cited, was not with material that would be deemed formally inadmissible in judicial proceedings but with material [...] "without a basis in evidence having rational probative force." [...] This was not a blanket rejection by the Court of administrative [...] reliance on hearsay irrespective of reliability and probative value. The opposite was the case.|$|E
50|$|Hypernasal speech, or , is {{primarily}} {{the result of}} velopharyngeal insufficiency, a sometimes congenital aberration in which the velopharyngeal sphincter allows <b>too</b> <b>much</b> air <b>into</b> the nasal cavity during speech.

Brown {{described}} it as [...] "a Vonnegut-type black humor novel that starts out very well but goes on <b>much</b> <b>too</b> long with <b>much</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> crammed <b>into</b> it." [...] However, he said [...] "the first 100 pages are really excellent."Analog Science Fiction and Fact critic P. Schuyler Miller noted [...] "it was like Ron Goulart's farces, only with more cutting edge—let's say, Goulart programmed by a Swift tape."In 1970 the public reception of the book however was low, and Sladek stopped writing science fiction novels that decade.|$|R
