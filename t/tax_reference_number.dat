30|$|This {{is unlike}} in South Africa where company {{registration}} can be herculean for new entrepreneurs or small business owners. In 2011, The Companies and Intellectual Property Registration Office (CIPRO) replaced the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) {{to see to}} registration of new businesses. Businesses can either fall into profit or non-profit organizations depending on its focus. The profit-making organizations can then take on the form of MSMEs, public or private company. Once a business is registered, it will then be registered automatically as a taxpayer. Newly established firms must register with local SARS office to obtain an income <b>tax</b> <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> Once the business commences, everything {{that has to do}} with registration must be completed within 60 [*]days. This organized and mandatory process of business registration has made it impossible for businesses to evade taxes. Small businesses with turnover of up to R 1 million per annum have their tax payment procedure enhanced; where taxes like turnover tax, VAT and employees’ tax are spread twice instead of once a year, making the process more efficient for qualifying small business owners (Online: [URL] Studies have shown that these mandatory conditions have been adduced as one of the challenges to start-ups and growth of MSMEs in South Africa (Olawale & Garwe, 2010; Mbonyane & Ladzani, 2011). However, there are also benefits of compliance with business registration to include business name protection, tax deductions, financial assistance and increasing your staff capacity.|$|E

50|$|For filing {{the regular}} tax return, in {{addition}} to the standard Form 1040, there are also two variants: the 1040A and 1040EZ. Form 1040 and 1040A use the same line numbering up to and including line 9; Form 1040EZ uses completely different line numbering. Line numbering {{is important to keep in}} mind since many state income <b>tax</b> returns <b>reference</b> line <b>numbers</b> on the 1040. The variants can only be used if a filer wants to take only the standard deduction: if a filer wants to itemize deductions then the 1040 must be used.|$|R

5000|$|In 1961 Wieland Förster {{set himself}} up in a Berlin shop {{building}} which became his studio. For some years he lived and worked here as a virtual hermit, visited by his family {{and a couple of}} close friends, notably [...] and Franz Fühmann. The authorities did not endorse his self-imposed exile but nor, at least initially, do they appear to have interfered. [...] His only child, Eva Förster, was born in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg quarter in 1968. From the time she was six years old her father insisted that she should keep a daily diary, a habit through which she developed a succinct writing style: she grew up to become a theatre critic, writer and lyricist-poet. [...] Between 1968 and 1972, the authorities became disruptive. Förster was banned from exhibiting his works between 1968 and 1973, and he was subjected to surveillance techniques that became increasingly intrusive. [...] In the absence of membership of the government approved professional association it became hard to obtain materials, and for some time he operated without an official <b>tax</b> payer <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> His perceived attitude in the great Formalism debate and his artistic style earned official condemnation. In the end, in December 1972, working under conditions of increasing privation from which his health suffered, he was able to arrange an evidently candid meeting with Konrad Wolf, the politically well connected president of the National Arts Academy, at which he spelled out his situation. The timing was propitious, in that the country's new leader, Erich Honecker, was cautiously trying to move the East German government beyond the unrelenting inflexibility of his predecessor. The exhibitions ban was lifted, and Förster found himself elected to membership of the National Arts Academy. More generally, from now on, till the demise of the East German state in 1989/90, he became a (semi-detached and unconventional) member of the artistic establishment: his relationship with the state now reflected a certain level of mutual acceptance bordering on respect.|$|R
