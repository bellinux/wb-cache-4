40|$|Abstract. Polycrystalline diamond, (PCD) is {{currently}} {{used in the}} industry for cutting tools of difficult-to-machine materials because of its superior characteristics such as hardness, toughness and wear resistance. But the PCD material is difficult to machine due to its above properties. Before making the PCD blank in varies tools, <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> process is essential and necessary. <b>The</b> <b>lapping</b> quality depends heavily on the parameters. Therefore it is of great significance to study the path and velocity of lapping process for ensuring <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> quality and uniform wear of abrasive disk. In this paper, {{on the basis of}} kinematics and geometry principle, the path equation was established. <b>The</b> complicated <b>lapping</b> process can be converted into two rotation movements, i. e. the movement of part against <b>the</b> center of <b>lapping</b> disk and rotation of fixture around its center. The relative path and relative velocity of random point of the part against abrasive disk were also analyzed and calculated. The computer simulation software was developed for figuring the path curves and instantaneous velocity of <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> process. <b>The</b> results show that the abrasive disk can wear uniformly and <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> quality can be raised. The application of computer simulation software provides the possibility to analyze <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> principles, which is a simple, convenient and effective method...|$|R
50|$|Drip Tank: The drip tank serves two purposes. 1) The {{friction}} {{produced from}} {{contact between the}} rough and <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> creates heat, which can damage <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> and create stress fractures in the stone. The drip tank allows the user to choose a drip rate via spigot and to position the spigot over <b>the</b> <b>lap,</b> nearer or farther from the arbor. 2) The dust produced from grinding minerals can cause pulmonary disease if inhaled. The flow of water captures the particles in a slurry, which drains into a rubber container around and below <b>the</b> <b>lap.</b> This container has an exit tube that drains into a second receptacle.|$|R

25|$|Although {{they did}} not {{immediately}} announce that they suspected foul play, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began to investigate the unusual and high-profile case by the day after Jackson's death. By August 28, <b>the</b> <b>LAPD</b> had announced that the case would be referred to prosecutors who might file criminal charges. Because <b>the</b> <b>LAPD</b> did not secure Jackson's home and allowed the Jackson family access to it too before returning to remove certain items, the department raised concerns by some observers that the chain of custody had been broken. The police maintained that they had followed protocol. On July 1, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) joined <b>the</b> <b>LAPD</b> in the investigation. Having the authority to investigate issues otherwise protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, the DEA could legally follow the entirety of {{what appeared to be}} the complex trail of prescription drugs supplied to Jackson.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} {{the second part of}} an on-going effort to gain better understanding of defect tolerance in braze joints. In {{the first part of this}} three-part series, we mechanically tested and modeled the strength of <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> joints as a function of the overlap distance. A failure criterion was established based on the zone damage theory, which predicts the dependence of <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> joint shear strength on the overlap distance, based on the critical size of a finite damage zone or an overloaded region in the joint. In this second part of the study, we experimentally verified the applicability of the damage zone criterion on prediction of the shear strength of <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> joint and introduced controlled flaws into <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> joints. <b>The</b> purpose of the study was to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> joint strength as a function of flaw size and its location through mechanical testing and nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) employing damage zone criterion for definition of failure. The results obtained from the second part of the investigation confirmed that the failure of <b>the</b> ductile <b>lap</b> shear brazed joints occurs when the damage zone reaches approximately 10 % of the overlap width.

40|$|HIPed (Hot Isostatically Pressed) {{silicon nitride}} ball blanks were lapped from {{diameter}} 13. 255 mm to diameter 12. 7 mm by a novel eccentric lapping machine. A maximum {{material removal rate}} of 68 Î¼m/hour has been achieved under a nominal lapping load of 43 N/ball. It {{was found that the}} material removal rate was increasing almost linearly with <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> load within this load range. When <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> load was higher than 43 N/ball, the material removal rate started to drop and <b>the</b> <b>lapped</b> ball roundness error started to increase. At <b>the</b> highest nominal <b>lapping</b> load of 107 N/ball, surface and subsurface damages were found on <b>the</b> <b>lapped</b> balls. Because of eccentric loading effect, the actual load on individual ball could be 25 ~ 28 % higher than <b>the</b> nominal <b>lapping</b> load. <b>The</b> surface residual stresses of lapped balls under different lapping loads were measured, and it was found that <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> load had less effect than previous HIP process.

No failure occurred on <b>the</b> ball <b>lapped</b> at 43 N/ball after 138 million stress cycles.
