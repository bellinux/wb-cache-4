5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial shark fisheries, dusky sharks are also caught as bycatch on longlines meant for <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> swordfish (and usually kept for its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of dusky sharks, mostly juveniles, are caught by sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia. This shark was {{once one of}} the most important species in the Florida trophy shark tournaments, before the population collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts provide {{habitats}} and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on the ocean floor. Marine mammals, sharks, <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Night {{sharks are}} quick, nocturnally active, {{schooling}} predators that feed mainly on small bony fishes and squid. Reproduction is viviparous {{as with the}} other members of its family; females mate during the summer and give birth to litters of usually 1218 pups after a gestation period of a year. This deepwater species is not known to pose a danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> swordfish longline fisheries in the western Atlantic, and also by a targeted longline fishery operating off northeastern Brazil. The night shark is highly valued for its fins, and additionally as a source of meat, liver oil, and fishmeal. However, most sharks caught off northeastern Brazil have been found to contain unsafe concentrations of mercury.|$|E
5|$|Over 97% of {{all known}} fish are oviparous, that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include salmon, goldfish, cichlids, <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> eels. In the {{majority}} of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the horn shark, and oviparous rays, such as skates. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tunas</b> <b>and</b> their {{relatives}} dominate the world’s largest ecosystems and sustain {{some of the}} most valuable fisheries. The impacts of fishing on these species has been debated intensively over the past decade, giving rise to divergent views on the scale and extent of the impacts of fisheries on pelagic ecosystems. We use all available age-structured stock assessments to evaluate the adult biomass trajectories and exploitation status of 26 populations of <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> {{their relatives}} (17 <b>tunas,</b> 5 mackerels <b>and</b> 4 Spanish mackerels) from 1953 to 2006. Overall, there has been a 48 % global decline in total adult biomass over the last half century. The trajectories of individual populations depend on the interaction between life histories, ecology and fishing pressure. The steepest declines are exhibited by two distinct groups: the largest longest-lived temperate <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> the smaller short-lived mackerels, both with most of their populations being overexploited. The remaining populations, mostly tropical tunas have been fished down to approximately maximum sustainable yield levels preventing further expansion of these fisheries. Fishing mortality has increased steadily to the point where around 15 % of the <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> their relatives are killed each year globally. Overcapacity of these fisheries is jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of these species. To guarantee higher catches, stable profits, and reduce collateral impacts on marine ecosystems requires rebuilding of overexploited populations and stricter management measures to reduce overcapacity.

40|$|To {{obtain a}} {{fundamental}} knowlege {{of the vision}} of <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> marlins the brains were observed morphologically, and the retinae were examined histologically <b>and</b> electrophysiologically. <b>Tunas</b> <b>and</b> marlins have an extremely well developed optic tectum indicating that vision {{is very important to}} them. The S-potentials recorded from the retinae showed that <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> marlins are probably color-blind. The retinae has cones (predominantly twin cones) in parallel arrangement, 3 layers of horizontal cells, no fovea nor well-developed area. Dense retinal tapetum was found in the bigeye tuna. Visual acuity determined from cone density ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 5, which is the highest among fishes. It is believed that the retinae of these fishes are advantageous for movement perception, and that their eyes are well adapted to the low light levels in the lower limits of their vertical distribution (ca. 500 m). Sight feeding was confirmed by experimental fishing by longlines with inedible artificial lures...|$|R

5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E

5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E
