5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, <b>technical</b> <b>co-operation</b> and maritime security.|$|E

The European Commission signed an agreement with Israel in July 2004 allowing for its participation in the EU's Galileo project for a global navigation satellite system.

2500|$|Operation Prairie Flat {{was a test}} {{involving}} the detonation of a [...] spherical surface charge of TNT to evaluate airblast, ground shock and thermal effects of nuclear weapons. Since TNT charges produce roughly double the airburst effect of nuclear weapons, it allowed testing {{the equivalent of a}} [...] nuclear weapon surface burst. It was a continuation of the <b>technical</b> <b>co-operation</b> (Canada, United States, Great Britain) series of tests sponsored jointly by the respective governments. Similar to previous tests, a large number of projects were carried out simultaneously due to the infrequent opportunity and cost of large explosives tests – the United States alone conducted 39 projects. The resulting airblast also allowed testing various targets at a range of overpressures to verify how structures resist effects of nuclear weapons. These included troop field shelters, fiberglass manholes, foxhole overhead covers, blast valves and electrical generators. Debris fracturing and transport were also tested as part of the effort to understand nuclear blast effects on Nike-X anti-ballistic missile sites. An additional goal of the test was to compare the blast with the previous Distant Plain Event 6 that used an equivalent but smaller [...] configuration in order to study scaling factors.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{economic}} integration in Asia has many dimensions to it. As different sub-regions {{of the continent}} pursue a distinct course of economic integration within, they are also simultaneously entering into economic arrangements across sub-regions. This article undertakes {{an evaluation of the}} Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral <b>Technical</b> and Economic <b>Co-operation</b> (BIMSTEC), an inter-sub-regional organization, for its ability to act as a bridge between South and Southeast Asia. The analysis involves an assessment of the design and the potential of this sub-regional grouping against regional realities and its performance thus far. Further, the article examines the more fundamental issue of the scope for convergence in the economic integration processes in South and Southeast Asia. In the light of evidence to indicate that inter-sub-regional economic integration is feasible only in the long run, the article makes some recommendations for the BIMSTEC to remain relevant to the region...|$|R
