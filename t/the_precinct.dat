5|$|In the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney earned over 50% of {{the vote}} in <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> that {{included}} Trump Tower, one of two Manhattan voting precincts to do so (the other being <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> that included the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel). However, although Trump received 23 votes in the district during the 2016 Republican primary, signifying the most votes of any Republican candidate there, there were 67 votes for his opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary. In 2016, within <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> that contained Trump Tower, 200 people voted for Clinton as opposed to 95 for Trump.|$|E
5|$|Detective J.D. LaRue (Kiel Martin) {{attempts}} to woo Davenport using {{less and less}} ethical means, eventually calling her back to <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> {{to pick up her}} lost client even though he was never found. When she realizes his ruse, she pours a cup of hot coffee in his lap. Undercover officer Belker (Bruce Weitz) arrests a bald-headed pickpocket at the hostage situation and processes him at <b>the</b> <b>precinct.</b> Belker's proclivity for biting the ankles of perpetrators redeems itself in this episode. Desk Sergeant Phil Esterhaus (Michael Conrad) confides in Fay about his teen-age sweetheart, Cindy. When officers Hill (Michael Warren) and Renko (Charles Haid) respond to a domestic situation, their police car is stolen, and they are shot after walking into a rundown building while trying to find a phone to call in the theft.|$|E

5|$|On {{the border}} of Southcote and Tilehurst is the Meadway Precinct, which {{includes}} an Asda supermarket and a Boots pharmacy, {{as well as other}} smaller shops. <b>The</b> <b>precinct</b> opened in 1967, and a survey in 2012 revealed that the public thought the site had become run-down and required modernisation. In 2015 a planning application was submitted to Reading Borough Council by a developer who plans to renovate the site.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> lay the abbey's infirmary: a {{hospital}} used to care for ill or elderly canons. The infirmary was made up of two large buildings: one a chapel; the other a hall (with latrines to one end) serving as a ward. The abbey precinct also contained an almonry, where poor boys received a free education in a type of boarding school; a water mill; a dovecote; and a fishpond.|$|E

5|$|Poems {{were also}} written to {{celebrate}} kingship. For example, at <b>the</b> <b>Precinct</b> of Amun-Re at Karnak, Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC) of the Eighteenth dynasty erected a stela commemorating his military victories {{in which the}} gods bless Thutmose in poetic verse and ensure for him victories over his enemies. In addition to stone stelas, poems have been found on wooden writing boards used by schoolboys. Besides the glorification of kings, poems were written to honor various deities, and even the Nile.|$|E

Captain Tricia Harper, Michael's commanding officer at <b>the</b> <b>precinct,</b> was a co-conspirator in Michael's car accident; however, it is hinted that her involvement was reluctant. Captain Carl Kessel (commanding officer at Hawkins' precinct) hid heroin in a storage unit {{for himself and}} Harper, and was behind Michael's car accident. For the crash the two used Ed Hawkins, on orders from Kessel.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} {{assault on the}} northern wall, the defenders fled to the Temple Mount, pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted <b>the</b> <b>precinct,</b> butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Tancred then called {{a halt to the}} slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection. When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Provençals to enter the city. Iftikhar al-Dawla, the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to Ascalon.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to <b>the</b> <b>precinct.</b> International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E

5|$|Fremantle Prison {{comprises}} substantially intact convict era structures, {{including the}} limestone perimeter walls of exceptional heritage significance. Other structures, {{dating from the}} time <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> was in use as a colonial and state prison, are also significant. The convict era complex includes the 1859 main cell block, chapel and wards, yards and refractory cells; perimeter walls, gate house complex and prison officer residences on the Terrace; service buildings and hospital; south-eastern workshops; ramp access tramway (Fairbairn Street) and Henderson Street Warder's Cottages. Other elements which contribute to the site's overall heritage significance include the western workshops (1900); new division (1907); and conversion of service building to the female division {{and the addition of}} an eastern range (1889–1909).|$|E
5|$|The Cavendish family {{sold the}} abbey in 1733, at which point, with Cavendish House in ruins, <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> {{was being used}} as {{agricultural}} land. By the 19th century the abbey {{had come into the}} possession of the Earls of Dysart. Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, sold the land east of the River Soar (known as Abbey Meadows) in 1876; this was to allow Leicester Town Council to undertake flood prevention work. The part of this land between the river and the Grand Union Canal was developed by the Town Council into a public space known as Abbey Park, which was opened by King Edward VII (then Prince of Wales) in 1882.|$|E
5|$|With {{greater power}} and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070BC), Egypt devoted still more {{resources}} to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate. Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled {{a large portion of}} Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals. The most important god of the time was Amun, whose main cult center, <b>the</b> <b>Precinct</b> of Amun-Re at Karnak in Thebes, eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose high priests may have wielded considerable political influence.|$|E

5|$|Bede relates {{that the}} East Anglian apostle Saint Felix came to England from Burgundy as a missionary bishop {{and was sent}} by Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, to assist in {{establishing}} Christianity in Sigeberht's kingdom. William of Malmesbury had the later story that Felix accompanied Sigeberht to East Anglia. In either case, this dates Sigeberht's accession to around 629–630, because Felix was bishop for seventeen years, his successor Thomas for five and Thomas' successor Berhtgisl Boniface for seventeen– and Berhtgisl died in around 669. Sigeberht established the bishop's seat of his kingdom for Felix at Dommoc, claimed variously for Dunwich or Walton, Felixstowe (both coastal sites in Suffolk). If the seat was at Walton (as Rochester claimed during the 13th century), the site of Dommoc may have been within <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> of a Roman fort which formerly stood there.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings {{and some of its}} estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable {{for one of the most}} important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre. <b>The</b> <b>precinct</b> buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces.|$|E
5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from <b>the</b> <b>precinct</b> where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he saved his life by gunning down a homeless man, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom and now uses a cane and prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E
