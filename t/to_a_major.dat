5|$|Buckinghamshire County Council's architect, Fred Pooley, {{had spent}} {{considerable}} {{time in the}} early sixties developing ideas for a new town in the Bletchley and Wolverton area. He developed a futuristic proposal based on a monorail linking a series of individual townships <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> town centre. The county council published the proposals in 1966, {{but it was too}} late to influence the government.|$|E

Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.|$|E

5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away {{most of the}} clouds above John and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed into the central Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses John would make.|$|E

5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in the trail, and Avery (who led the charge after Perkins’ death in 1932) {{was able to bring}} other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

Four additional categories in the American Roots Music field were eliminated (Best Contemporary Folk Album, Best Hawaiian Music Album, Best Traditional Folk Album, Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album). Native American works will now be eligible for the Best Regional Roots Music Album category.|$|E

5|$|BOAC Flight 712 (callsign Speedbird 712) was a British Overseas Airways Corporation service {{operated}} by a Boeing 707-465 from London Heathrow Airport bound for Sydney via Zurich and Singapore. On Monday 8 April 1968, it suffered an engine failure on takeoff that quickly led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> fire. The engine fell off the aircraft in flight. After the aircraft had made a successful emergency landing, confusion over checklists and distractions from {{the presence of a}} check captain contributed to the deaths of five of the 127 on board.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> population center (Knoxville) {{in the unlikely event}} of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount}} of destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|During October 7, {{with warm}} water helping to fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 millibars early on the 8th. This made Madeline a moderate Category 4 hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of Zihuatanejo as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 9, Hernan was {{upgraded}} to a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). Convection around the eye continued become more symmetrical, though the National Hurricane Center had stated that Hernan had most likely {{reached its peak}} intensity or {{was very close to}} doing so. However, the eye suddenly became better defined. Based on this, Hernan was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> hurricane. The intensity of Hernan was uncertain, as there was some difference between intensity estimates. Hernan maintained its appearance through the evening and it was stated that the peak intensity of the storm may have been 125mph (205km/h). Overnight, Hernan moved over cooler waters and started to weaken. Although the eye remained well defined, outflow to all the southwestern semicircle became poor.|$|E
5|$|Except for its two stations—one at {{each end}} of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground.

It was open for only three years before being converted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it was not included in the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
