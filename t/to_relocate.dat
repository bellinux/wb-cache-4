5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt <b>to</b> <b>relocate</b> the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city.

The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive <b>to</b> <b>relocate</b> following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} the relocation of the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since the relocation of the New Orleans Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979.
