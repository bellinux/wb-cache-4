40|$|Despite {{starting}} from a highly fragmentary development policy system, a considerable consensus on policy norms for effective <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> has become prevalent on the EU level. This consensus makes {{claims about the}} EU’s role in European <b>development</b> <b>cooperation.</b> This role embraces the EU’s active promotion of approximation and convergence of European policies on aid and <b>development</b> <b>cooperation,</b> the EU’s so called “federating role”.

After clarifying the theoretical background and main concepts, the paper has provided, first, a long term narrative of institutional dynamics in EU <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> and, second, a close-up illustration for the period between 2009 and 2012.

40|$|Abstract The {{water and}} {{sanitation}} sector is verifiably receiving increased attention and funding through international <b>development</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Not least {{because of the way}} that it affects incentives and institutions in partner countries, <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> can have either positive or negative effects on human rights though. The consolidated frameworks for the human rights to {{water and sanitation}} is becoming linked to the international community’s coordinated development efforts, as evidenced notably in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. However, a review of major funders’ official policies for <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the sector suggests that many only partially endorse the frameworks for the human rights to water and sanitation. An observation of <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> flows to the sector allows the hypothesis to be advanced that worldwide inequalities in access to these services may be reduced through a full and clear application of the human rights framework in <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> activities. The article presents findings of this research and explores key stakes for <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the water and sanitation sector that are relevant for their ability to either negatively or positively contribute to the realization of human rights...|$|R
40|$|Gender {{inequality}} {{is still}} a wide spread problem in the world today. One way of working for gender equality is via <b>development</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Nowadays gender equality advocacy is an accepted and important part of <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> and to target women is a common policy. According to several strands of research on women´s representation in political science, women´s inclusion as decision making actors matters for policy outcomes that address women's interests. Is this something acknowledged by <b>development</b> <b>cooperation?</b> In this thesis, I explore this {{by looking at the}} case of Sweden´s <b>development</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Sweden is a country with a history as active in gender equality policy both domestically and internationally. As such an exemplary case, one would therefore expect Sweden to be sensitive to this in policy strategy concerning <b>development</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The method used is qualitative content analysis and the materials analyzed are policy documents. The result is that there are several signs in the documents of that Sweden has adopted an aim for women´s representation under the notion of women as actors within <b>development</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The documents also gave examples of implementation in projects but further research could focus on how well the aim is implemented...|$|R
