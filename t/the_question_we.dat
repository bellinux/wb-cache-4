The dubious honor was bestowed by votes of both magazine readership and city residents. In dealing with global warming and New York's role in it, Bloomberg has enacted a plan called PlaNYC: A Greener, Greater New York to fight global warming, protect the environment and prepare New York for the projected 1 million more people expected {{to be living in}} the city by the year 2030. Bloomberg has been involved in motivating other cities to make changes, delivering the keynote address at the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit and stating, [...] "e now know beyond a doubt that global warming is a reality. And <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>we</b> must all answer is, {{what are we going to}} do about it?" [...] Bloomberg also talked about how he would go about fighting climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, using cleaner and more efficient fuels, and encouraging public transportation. His ideas have occasionally been rejected, such as the New York State Assembly's rejection of his idea for applying congestion pricing below 60th Street in Manhattan.|$|E

To this end, we suggest various lines of investigation that urbanists might undertake to engender a metropolitics that really makes some noise...|$|R
