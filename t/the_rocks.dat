Jericho then tried to hit a <b>Rock</b> Bottom through <b>the</b> announce table, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> reversed it into a People's DDT through <b>the</b> table. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> threw Jericho into the ring and set him for a Rock Bottom, but Jericho countered it into a Breakdown. He set <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> up for <b>the</b> People's Elbow, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> caught his legs, and applied a Sharpshooter on Jericho. Jericho reversed it into his own Sharpshooter, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> got to <b>the</b> ropes to break the hold. Jericho then applied the Walls of Jericho, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> countered it into a roll-up. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> hit a Rock Bottom, as Mr. McMahon came down to ringside. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> went for <b>the</b> pinfall but McMahon distracted <b>the</b> referee. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> hit McMahon, and hit a Spinebuster on Jericho. He brought McMahon into the ring and hit Jericho with a People's Elbow. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> attacked McMahon and, while the referee checked McMahon, Jericho hit a low blow and a Rock Bottom to win the match, and the title.|$|R

50|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was the {{encounter}} of Goldberg and The Rock; the main feud from the Raw brand {{heading into the}} event. The feud began on the March 31, 2003 episode of Raw, where <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> held a segment entitled <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> Appreciation Night, a segment intended to promote his win against Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIX. During <b>the</b> segment, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> discussed <b>the</b> list of people he has beaten in his career including Steve Austin, wondering who would challenge him next into a match. Goldberg then made his WWE debut, as he {{came down to the}} ring and stated that he would be <b>The</b> <b>Rock's</b> next challenge. After the confrontation, Goldberg speared <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> <b>The</b> following week on Raw, Goldberg and <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> had another confrontation, where Goldberg provoked <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> into answering his challenge, but <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> refused. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> finally accepted Goldberg's challenge on the April 14, 2003 episode of Raw via satellite. The week before Backlash, the feud intensified as <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> held another segment entitled <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> Concert, where he mocked Goldberg with Gillberg, a wrestler whose gimmick was to parody Goldberg. Later into the segment, Goldberg appeared from the audience and entered the ring, only to have <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> execute a Rock Bottom on him.|$|R
50|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} SummerSlam was between <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> and Booker T, battling over the WCW Championship. After losing the WWF Championship to Steve Austin at WrestleMania X-Seven, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> took a hiatus from {{professional}} wrestling to film the movie, The Scorpion King. On the edition of July 9, 2001 of Raw Is War, campaigning for <b>The</b> <b>Rock's</b> return began. Following <b>the</b> campaigning, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> returned to <b>the</b> WWF on the edition of July 30, 2001 of Raw Is War, where {{he chose to}} align himself with the WWF instead of The Alliance for The Invasion. This action was shown by <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> delivering a <b>Rock</b> Bottom and <b>the</b> people's elbow onto Shane McMahon, The Alliance leader. Later that week on SmackDown!, Booker T and <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> cut a promo, where Booker T challenged <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> to a match at SummerSlam; {{the beginning of the}} Rock-Booker T rivalry. Seeking revenge for the attack on the edition of July 30, 2001 of Raw Is War, McMahon fought <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> in a Street Fight on the edition of August 6 of Raw Is War, where <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> pinned McMahon. <b>The</b> rivalry between <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> and Booker T intensified after the match, where Booker T and Shane McMahon double-teamed <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> Later that week on SmackDown!, in retaliation, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> accepted Booker T's challenge. On the edition of August 13 of Raw Is War, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> was involved in a tag team match, where he teamed with Chris Jericho in a loss to Booker T and Rhyno. After the match, Booker T delivered his variation of <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> Bottom on <b>The</b> <b>Rock,</b> a move dubbed, The Book End. On the final edition of SmackDown! before SummerSlam, McMahon announced that Booker T would defend the WCW Championship at SummerSlam against <b>The</b> <b>Rock.</b> Later that night, the rivalry continued to intensify during a Lights Out match between Booker T and <b>The</b> <b>Rock,</b> after Booker T delivered a Book End onto <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> through a commentators announce table.|$|R

Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards.

Suddenly, the weather changed and Napi became cold as the wind whistled and the rain fell. Napi asked <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> to return his robe, but <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> refused. Napi got mad and just took the clothing. As he strolled away, he heard a loud noise and turning, he saw <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> was rolling after him. Napi ran for his life. The deer, the bison and the {{pronghorn}} were Napi's friends, {{and they tried to}} stop <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> by running in front of it. <b>The</b> <b>rock</b> rolled over them.

A frustrated Rock nearly fell into the same trap Cena did the year before when he taunted Cena with Cena's own [...] "You Can't See Me" [...] taunt before going for a second People's Elbow, however Cena caught <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> and delivered a second AA for another near-fall. <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> soon went for a third Rock Bottom, but Cena countered and executed a Rock Bottom instead for a nearfall. Cena then tried to sucker <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> into a third AA by faking a People's Elbow attempt, the same mistake that cost Cena the match the last year. However, when Cena went for the third AA, <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> countered into a third Rock Bottom for another 2 count. Afterwards, both John Cena and <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> went for an AA and a Rock Bottom respectively. This continued until <b>The</b> <b>Rock</b> delivered a DDT on Cena. But instead of pinning Cena, Rock instead went for a fourth Rock Bottom and Cena countered with a third AA to win the match and the title.
