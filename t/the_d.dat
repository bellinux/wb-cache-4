40|$|Dynamical {{generation}} of 4 d gauge theories and gravity at low energy from <b>the</b> 3 <b>d</b> ones at high energy is studied, {{based on the}} fermion condensation mechanism recently proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen and Georgi. For gravity, 4 d Einstein gravity is generated from the multiple copy of <b>the</b> 3 <b>d</b> ones, by referring to the two form gravity. Since <b>the</b> 3 <b>d</b> Einstein action without matter coupling is topological, ultraviolet divergences are less singular in our model. In the gauge model, matter fermions are introduced on the discrete lattice following Wilson. Then, <b>the</b> 4 <b>d</b> gauge interactions are correctly generated from <b>the</b> 3 <b>d</b> theories even in the left-right asymmetric theories of the standard model. In order for this to occur, the Higgs fields {{as well as the}} gauge fields of the extra dimension should be generated by the fermion condensates. Therefore, the {{generation of}} <b>the</b> 4 <b>d</b> standard model from the multiple copy of <b>the</b> 3 <b>d</b> ones is quite promising.
