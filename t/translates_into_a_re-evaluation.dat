As a result, if recovery is excluded from consideration, a number of contraction operators are <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single revision operator, which can be then <b>translated</b> back <b>into</b> exactly one contraction operator. This operator {{is the only one}} of the initial group of contraction operators that satisfies recovery; among this group, it is the operator that preserves as much information as possible.|$|R
