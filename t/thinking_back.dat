The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} {{computational}} <b>thinking</b> dates <b>back</b> {{at least to}} the 1950s but most ideas are much older. [...] The term computational thinking was first used by Seymour Papert in 1980 and again in 1996. Computational thinking can be used to algorithmically solve complicated problems of scale, and is often used to realize large improvements in efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the usage}} of {{vertical}} thinking is often favored over lateral thinking in most academic fields {{such as those of}} science and mathematics, there are noticeable shortcomings when considering this method of thinking. Vertical thinking is often preferred when considering academical backgrounds as the thought process provides a credible plotting. Due to the sequential nature of the thought process, the steps required to reach an outcome are often easily drawn from. This often adds to the perceived legitimacy as well as allow for easier verification of validity. Furthermore, when considering the linear approach, the solutions generated from such methods of thinking are often neutral, which is again preferred when bearing in mind an academic background. Moreover, the risks of this method of thinking is much lower than that of lateral <b>thinking.</b> <b>Backed</b> by an existing knowledge base, solutions generated using this method are more well informed.|$|R

50|$|Liberalism has {{a shorter}} history than realism {{but has been}} a {{prominent}} theory since World War I. It is a concept {{with a variety of}} meanings. Liberal <b>thinking</b> dates <b>back</b> to philosophers such as Thomas Paine and Immanuel Kant, who argued that republican constitutions produce peace.

2500|$|Bradley {{describes}} the theme as [...] "youthful idealism" [...] {{and how far}} it can take someone [...] "if it's not stamped out, as it so often is." [...] <b>Thinking</b> <b>back</b> to his own childhood, he identifies with Flavia's 11-year-old zeal, remembering the [...] "feeling of being absolutely unstoppable," [...] capable of anything. He explains, [...] "when you're that age, you sometimes have a great burning enthusiasm that is very deep and very narrow, {{and that is something}} that has always intrigued me - that world of the 11-year-old that is so quickly lost." [...] Reviewer Francisca Goldsmith notes this theme as well, suggesting that readers [...] "may come away with a slightly altered view of what is possible for a headstrong girl to achieve." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011 the pop-culture website The A.V. Club {{reviewed}} {{all four}} Chrismukkah episodes for its [...] "TV Club Advent Calendar." [...] The writer noted, [...] "When <b>thinking</b> <b>back</b> on holiday specials of yore for this project, {{the first thing}} that popped into my head wasn't nostalgia for my Rankin/Bass- and Chuck Jones-filled youth. Instead, I immediately focused on a much more recent obsession: Chrismukkah. Created by The O.C.s Seth Cohen ...." [...] The reviewer continued, saying that [...] "A thread of underlying sadness unites all four Chrismukkah episodes, but it's a sadness that begs to be redeemed {{by the end of the}} hour. Chrismukkah is really about traditional Christmas togetherness and your standard happy ending; it's the everyday miracle of people coming together to create something magical." ...|$|E
2500|$|Here Fastolf's {{betrayal}} is {{the direct}} {{cause of the}} English defeat, not {{the fact that they}} were outnumbered ten-to-one, that they were hit by a surprise attack or that they were surrounded. This notion is returned to several times, with the implication each time that only treachery can account for an English defeat. For example, upon hearing of the first loss of towns in France, Exeter immediately asks, [...] "How were they lost? What treachery was used?" [...] (1.1.68). Upon losing Rouen, Talbot exclaims, [...] "France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears/If Talbot but survive thy treachery" [...] (3.2.35–36). Later, when <b>thinking</b> <b>back</b> on the French campaign, Richard asks Henry, [...] "Have we not lost most part of all the towns/By treason, falsehood and by treachery" [...] (5.5.108–109).|$|E

2500|$|In his 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama {{mentioned}} Frank, {{a friend}} in Hawaii of his maternal grandfather Stanley Dunham; Obama later identified the man as Davis. Obama said Davis recounted that he and Stanley Dunham had grown up 50 miles apart in Kansas, near Wichita, although they did not meet until living in Hawaii. Davis described the way Kansas race relations were back then, including Jim Crow restrictions, and his belief {{that there had been}} little progress since then. As Obama remembered, [...] "It made me smile, <b>thinking</b> <b>back</b> on Frank and his old Black Power, dashiki self. In some ways he was as incurable as my mother, as certain in his faith, living in the same sixties time warp that Hawaii had created." [...] Obama also remembered Frank Davis later in life after taking a job in South Chicago as a community organizer. One day Obama visited areas where Davis had lived, writing, [...] "I imagined Frank in a baggy suit and wide lapels, {{standing in front of the}} old Regal Theatre, waiting to see Duke or Ella emerge from a gig." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014.

But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was <b>thinking</b> <b>back</b> then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

And they included towel, soap, toothbrush, mirror and comb and brush, a red scarf, and gloves. It occurred to her how seldom she carried that bag on her saddle, and, <b>thinking</b> <b>back,</b> referred the fact to accident, and then with honest amusement owned that the motive might have been also a little vanity. Taking the bag, {{she went to a}} flat stone by the brook and, rolling up her sleeves, proceeded to improve her appearance. With deft fingers she rebraided her hair and arranged it as she had worn it when only sixteen. Then, resolutely, she got up and crossed over to where Kells was unpacking.|$|E
