A hospital administrator <b>there</b> <b>said</b> {{that she had}} looked {{into some of the}} allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor. In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would {{be said for}} the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was <b>there,</b> <b>said</b> the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled because it was too early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E

In 969, the city of Antioch was retaken by the Byzantines, the first major city in Syria to be lost by the Arabs. Byzantine success was not total; in 964 another failed attempt was made to take Sicily by sending an army led by an illegitimate nephew of Nikephoros, Manuel Phokas. In 969, Nikephoros was murdered in his palace by John Tzimiskes, who took the throne for himself.|$|E

[...] The magazine Being <b>There</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "like any good bluegrass band, Nickel Creek proves capable of playing rousing instrumentals." [...] BBC also discussed {{the difference between}} the three instrumentals featured on the album, stating [...] ""First And Last Waltz" [...] is smooth and dreamy, [...] "Stumptown" [...] is a merry little jig, and [...] "Scotch And Chocolate" [...] is just reel-y (sic) good." ...|$|E
500|$|The text, [...] "", is {{a variant}} of the opening verse of the [...] The better known version from the Vulgate, ending on [...] "... bonae voluntatis," [...] is an {{incorrect}} rendering of the original Greek version of , <b>there</b> <b>said</b> by angels in the Christmas night. The Vulgate version translates as [...] "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will," [...] while the end of the Greek version is rendered more correctly as [...] "Peace on earth, and good will towards men," [...] as it was understood by Luther (""). Lutheran theologians thus rejected the Vulgate version (they would have the verse end on [...] "... bonae voluntes" [...] in Latin), while composers were attached to the classic formula for its melodious rhythm. This Magnificat interpolation is the only place where Bach uses a version of the Gloria text that differs from the Vulgate, more or less catching the spirit of the theologian-approved version.|$|E
500|$|Illmatic is also {{credited}} with reviving the Queensbridge rap scene. Once home to prestigious pioneers such as Marley Marl, MC Shan, Roxanne Shanté, Queensbridge {{had been one}} of the most productive hip hop scenes in the country during the 1980s. In an April 2006 article, an XXL columnist wrote of the history and impact of the Queensbridge hip hop scene, stating [...] "Since the 1980s, New York City's Queensbridge Housing Projects has been documented perhaps better than any other geographic location. Starting with super producer Marley Marl's dominant Juice Crew in the ’80s all the way through ’90s mainstays like Nas, Cormega and Capone, the Bridge has produced the highest per-capita talent of any ’hood." [...] Yet during the early 1990s, the Queensbridge rap scene was otherwise stagnant [...] According to Nas: [...] "I was coming from the legacy of Marley Marl, MC Shan, Juice Crew kind of vibe. Knowing these guys out in the neighborhood. At that time, the Queensbridge scene was dead. Dropping that album right <b>there</b> <b>said</b> a lot for me to carry on the legacy of the Queensbridge pioneers." ...|$|E

Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said [...] "On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify. It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." [...] Griffin's {{interview with}} Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, [...] "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act." [...] He rejected claims that the BNP was [...] "acting unlawfully" [...] and said [...] "...because we are here, as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups—it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter <b>there</b> <b>said</b> that we'll only lift a finger for white people—that's a simple lie." [...] In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer, BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler, implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to [...] "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying [...] "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" [...] (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).|$|E
