40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} variable contrast injection durations and scanning delay determined by <b>test</b> <b>injection</b> analysis of computed tomography angiography (CTA) of peripheral arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a flow phantom that simulates the hemodynamics in a lower extremity artery. We set the flow rate at the pump to 2. 0 or 5. 0 L/minute. In protocol 1, we adopted a variable contrast injection duration based on the peak enhancement time of the <b>test</b> <b>injection</b> monitoring at the central level of the scan range. In protocol 2, we adopted a fixed contrast injection duration. The scanning delay was determined with a conventional bolus-tracking technique monitoring {{at the top of}} the scan range. Mean arterial attenuation and difference between the maximum and minimum attenuation values were calculated. To verify the phantom study results, clinical study, including 16 patients was performed under protocol 1. RESULTS: The mean attenuation values under protocols 1 and 2 were comparable (563. 6 Hounsfield units [HU] and 535. 0 HU, respectively) at a pump flow rate of 2. 0 L/minute; at 5. 0 L/minute, they were 289. 4 HU and 328. 8 HU. The difference between the maximum and minimum attenuation values was smaller under protocol 1 than protocol 2 (76. 8 HU vs. 184. 9 HU) at a pump flow of 2. 0 L/minute and also smaller under protocol 1 than protocol 2 (79. 7 HU vs. 203. 8 HU) at 5. 0 L/minute. In clinical study, the mean attenuation value was 332. 6 +/- 51. 9 HU, and the difference between the maximum and minimum attenuation values was 55. 1 +/- 24. 4 HU. CONCLUSION: The object-specific injection duration based on <b>test</b> <b>injection</b> at the central level of the scan range provides sufficient and constant vascular enhancement at CTA...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSouth Africa {{will require}} a {{portfolio}} of technologies to meet its climate change goals. Within this portfolio, {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) is of particular importance as the only technology to mitigate CO 2 emissions from large-scale fossil fuel usage in fuel transformation, industry and power generation. Since 2009, the South African Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage (SACCCS) has been investigating the technical feasibility of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in South Africa. The South African CCS Roadmap, which was endorsed by the Cabinet of South Africa on the 4 th May 2012, provides the overarching direction for the work of SACCCS. The key milestones of the South African CCS Roadmap are as follows: 2004 Assessment of the potential for CCS in South Africa 2010 Development of a South African CO 2 geological storage atlas 2017 Commencement of a CO 2 <b>Test</b> <b>Injection</b> Project (10, 000 - 50, 000 tCO 2 stored) 2020 Facilitate the commencement of a CCS demonstration plant (in the order of 100, 000 tCO 2 /year) 2025 +Inform the implementation of commercial CCS deployment (over 1, 000, 000 tCO 2 /year) OngoingProvide support to other CCS activities in South AfricaThe 2010 Atlas on geological storage of CO 2 in South Africa identified Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Eastern Cape as the regions with the most potential for safe and secure CO 2 storage. SACCCS is now planning further exploration of this potential. Exploration will involve establishing the geological suitability of the regions and will be supported by environmental assessments and engagement with all relevant stakeholders. Only if this exploration is successful and an appropriate site is identified, SACCCS will develop a CO 2 <b>Test</b> <b>Injection</b> Project to further evaluate and build experience around the technology in a South African context. The <b>Test</b> <b>Injection</b> Project will enable South Africa to better understand the role of CCS in reducing CO 2 emissions and meeting the challenges of climate change...|$|E

40|$|The {{definition}} {{as well as}} {{the economic}} viability of the most suitable development strategy of a hydrocarbon reservoir mainly depend on the quantity and type of fluids, and on well productivity. Well testing, consisting in measuring the pressure variations induced in the reservoir during hydrocarbon production, has been used to assess fluid nature and well potential for decades, especially in exploration and appraisal scenarios. Today's industry drivers for formation evaluation methodologies demand safe, environmentally friendly, and cost effective test procedures due to more stringent environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and hence restricting flaring of hydrocarbons produced during a test {{as well as the}} need for reducing operating costs - even more so with current oil prices. Different methods have been proposed or resuscitated over the last years, such as wireline formation tests, closed chamber <b>tests,</b> production/reinjection <b>tests,</b> <b>injection</b> <b>tests</b> and harmonic pulse test, as viable alternatives to conventional well testing. In this paper an insight is provided on wireline formation <b>tests,</b> <b>injection</b> <b>testing</b> and harmonic pulse testing to illustrate how testing techniques are evolving in the oil industry. The first one is a sort of mini test of the formation. The second methodology {{is one of the most}} promising methodologies to replace traditional well testing in reservoir characterization, but it does not offer the possibility of sampling formation fluids and thus is complementary to the previous one. The third one gives the same information of a conventional test, except for initial pressure, without significantly altering field operations thus it is well suited for monitoring production and storage wells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSouth African Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage (SACCCS) was {{established}} in 2009 by the South African government {{in collaboration with the}} South African industry and international governments to examine the technical potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in South Africa. The current focus of SACCCS is the development of a <b>Test</b> <b>Injection</b> Project in South Africa. Core to delivering this project will be the engagement of the South African public at both a national and local level. CCS public engagement will have some unique challenges in South Africa given the significant diversity of the population with regard to culture, language and economic situation. Given that South Africa is a developing country, communication about CCS technology also needs to be placed in the context of other national priorities such as access to energy, poverty alleviation, job creation and education. In April 2012 a consortium of South African and international consulting and research organisations was appointed as part of the World Bank South African Department of Energy CCS Study. The task of the consortium is to prepare two separate stakeholder engagement plans, a National Plan (NatPlan) and a Local Plan (LocPlan) prior to the commencement of CCS projects in South Africa, including the SACCCS <b>Test</b> <b>Injection</b> Project.

40|$|Context The {{selective}} arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> is {{a functional}} examination to determine localization of functional neuroendocrine tumor. Since the selective arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> capitalizes on the hormone-secreting ability of neuroendocrine tumor, no reports on this test in non-functional neuroendocrine tumors have yet been published. Objective In this study, we evaluate {{the utility of}} the selective arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> for non-functional neuroendocrine tumors. Methods The selective arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> was conducted in 8 non-functional neuroendocrine tumors cases. Results were compared to 10 functional neuroendocrine tumor (5 insulinoma, 5 gastrinoma) cases, and reactivity of insulin and gastrin was retrospectively considered. Insulin and gastrin immunostaining was conducted, and immunostaining results were compared with selective arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> reactivity. Results The insulin-positive rate following vasa vasorum stimulation was 75 % (6 / 8), and that for distant vessels was 25 % (2 / 8). Selective arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> reactivity and tumor localization were related. Insulin immunostaining was positive in 50 % of cases (4 / 8). The increase in insulin in the selective arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> in negative immunostaining cases was 8. 9 μU/mL, and that in positive immunostaining cases was 31. 4 μU/mL. Positive immunostaining cases tended to have greater increases in insulin than negative immunostaining cases (P= 0. 089). Positive gastrin response rates were 75 % (6 / 8), 100 % (8 / 8), 0 %, and 0 % in the superior mesenteric artery, gastroduodenal artery, dorsal pancreatic artery, and proximal splenic artery, respectively. Gastrin immunostaining was negative in all cases, and no relationship between tumor localization and selective arterial secretagogue <b>injection</b> <b>test</b> reactivity was observed. Conclusion An increase in insulin response in non-functional neuroendocrine tumors suggests that tumors may have latent insulin secretory ability...|$|R
