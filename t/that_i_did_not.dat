25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> think I could stand it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow I would make it. He kept me.|$|E
25|$|Now, as it happened, I had {{confined}} myself {{strictly to}} the business of clearing the line, which was entrusted to me, and although I do not pretend that I considered the matter in its legal aspect at the time, the fact remains <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> give a shot, nor was I armed when captured. I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E

She is a myth. It is <b>not</b> merely <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> nature can guide us.

500|$|By {{the end of}} 2005, Lambis Nikolaou denied Gilady's claims: [...] "All this {{speculation}} surrounding my role in {{the third}} round of voting for the 2012 candidates is totally unfounded. I state <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> vote {{in the third round}} as I had announced {{at the time of the}} vote." [...] This statement was confirmed by the IOC voting numbers, which demonstrate that, even if Nikolaou had voted for Madrid, the city would have failed to beat Paris in the third voting round.|$|E
500|$|New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman {{stated that}} the {{settlement}} and payment by Trump [...] "is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university." [...] Trump himself said he settled [...] "for {{a small fraction of}} the potential award" [...] because he was too busy as president-elect to take it to trial. He added, [...] "The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!" ...|$|E
500|$|I {{told him}} to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause {{constantly}} thrown in my face. I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want it. [...] "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things." ...|$|E

500|$|Koval {{described}} his 57 years of post-spy life living in Russia as [...] "uneventful". His family {{knew he had}} done work for the GRU, but the subject was never discussed. He did not receive any high awards upon his return, a fact that bothered him. Bigger awards went to [...] "career men", he told Kramish. However, he ended his correspondence by {{saying that he was}} not protesting his treatment; [...] " [...] <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find myself in a Gulag, as might well have happened". Koval died in his Moscow apartment on January 31, 2006, at the age of 92.|$|E
500|$|Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald {{to stand}} for a vacant seat in Kingston, Ontario. It was a {{traditional}} Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister. In 1935 however, the riding had switched to the Liberals and King wanted to keep it. [...] "I told Mr. King <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know Kingston at all, nor its problems, nor its people", Macdonald wrote later. When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however, Macdonald {{had no choice but}} {{to stand for}} office in Kingston. He won the seat by acclamation on August 12, 1940.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> like her, but I did not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Borah's career bridged two eras of reform, {{according}} to Ashby, [...] "emotionally and intellectually he belonged {{with the older}} prewar [...] America. [...] As New Deal enthusiast Edgar Kemler observed, he 'was overtaken by obsolescence at an early age'." [...] Borah wrote in 1927, {{near the end of}} a decade of tumultuous change, [...] "I cannot think of any views which I now have <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have before the war." [...] In 1936, Time magazine noted that though Borah was the most famous senator of the century, and had long been [...] "the great Moral Force of the Senate... the conscience of the country has been placed in other pockets".|$|E
500|$|On July 25, Kennedy {{pleaded guilty}} to leaving {{the scene of an}} {{accident}} and was given a sentence of two months in jail, suspended. That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, [...] "I regard as indefensible the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> report the accident to the police immediately," [...] but he denied driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} and also denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne. Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office or resign; after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, Kennedy announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.|$|E
500|$|Kalabhavan Shajon, who {{previously}} {{worked in the}} industry as a comedian and the sidekick of the lead actors, was chosen for the main antagonistic role. The director stated, [...] "I had two-three actors in mind, but at last decided to pick Shajon. I was very clear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want anyone who has played negative characters so far to do the role. Shajon was a total revelation." [...] Roshan Basheer, who debuted through Plus Two (2010), was chosen after conducting a screen test. Prithviraj was rumored to play a cameo role, though this was denied by Jeethu. Asha Sarath was later signed {{for the role of}} a police officer. Child actors Ansiba Hassan and Esther Anil, along with Siddique, Irshad, Kunchan and Koottickal Jayachandran were also cast to play major supporting roles.|$|E

500|$|Davis saw his {{character}} as a romantic hero. Carter and Spotnitz, however, {{did not want}} [...] "Scully trusting this man she's spent seven years hating" [...] so easily. Eventually, the producers tweaked the script, adding [...] "the reality of The X-Filess existing mythos and past character development" [...] to ease the transition. Davis later noted, [...] "I was basically {{happy with the way}} [...] turned out, despite {{the fact that there were}} many other ideas that I had <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> get to see. My original conception of the story was that Cigarette-Smoking Man was a much better actor at winning Scully's affections and that Scully was less resistant to this attention to her." [...] Because The Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{called this}} idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
500|$|Keyes {{was also}} criticized for {{his views on}} homosexuality. In an {{interview}} with Michelangelo Signorile, a gay radio host, Keyes defined homosexuality as centering {{in the pursuit of}} pleasure, literally [...] "selfish hedonism". When Signorile asked if Mary Cheney, Vice President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, fit the description and was therefore a [...] "selfish hedonist", Keyes replied, [...] "Of course she is. That goes by definition." [...] Media sources picked up on the exchange, reporting that Keyes had [...] "trashed", [...] "attacked," [...] and [...] "lashed out at" [...] Mary Cheney, and had called her a [...] "sinner"—provoking condemnation of Keyes by LGBT Republicans and several GOP leaders. Keyes noted that it was an interviewer, not he, who brought up Mary Cheney's name in the above incident, and he told reporters, [...] "You have tried to personalize the discussion of an issue <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> personalize. The people asking me the question did so, and if that's inappropriate, blame the media. Do not blame me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are an Englishman," [...] she remarked thoughtfully, [...] "and {{intriguing}} with Anna. <b>I</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{understand the}} position." ...|$|R

500|$|Later authors {{appreciated}} Hebel's work too. Hermann Hesse once commented, [...] "As far as I know, in no {{literary history}} do we yet read that Hebel {{was the greatest}} German novelist, as great as Keller and more confident and purer and mightier in effect than Goethe." [...] Theodor W. Adorno lauded his essay Die Juden as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} German prose plays in defence of the Jews". In Die gerettete Zunge, Geschichte einer Jugend, Elias Canetti described the influence that Hebel's Schatzkästlein had on him: [...] "I never wrote a book, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> secretly aspire to his style, and I began by writing everything in shorthand, the knowledge of which I owe to him alone." [...] Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote, [...] "Hebel's stories are among the most beautiful in the German language", and included the [...] "Schatzkästlein" [...] and [...] "Die Rose" [...] in his Kanon Deutscher Literatur. [...] The first was also listed in the ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher.|$|E
500|$|Until he read Warner's Cricket Between Two Wars {{during the}} Second World War, Fingleton was unaware that Warner {{assumed he was}} {{responsible}} for the leak. When he found out, Fingleton wrote to Warner, who replied that although he believed Fingleton to be the source, he would publish a correction if presented with evidence to the contrary. Fingleton did not pursue the case. Australian cricketer Bill O'Reilly wrote that during the 1948 tour of England, he and Fingleton confronted Warner, who apologised as he no longer believed Fingleton to be the culprit. Fingleton thought the belief he was responsible cost him a place on the 1934 tour to England, although there were other possible factors in his exclusion. According to Fingleton, Woodfull later told him that the controversy had led to his missing selection. A letter which Woodfull wrote to Fingleton in 1943 stated [...] "I can assure you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> connect your name with the passing on of that conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. [...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes. I made it clear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E
