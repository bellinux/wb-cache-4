40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{strategic}} behavior of the leading firms on the Swedish wholesale electricity market. This thesis wishes to address <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>situation</b> on the market and how the firms can manipulate the price in order to maximize the profits. The Swedish electricity market was deregulated in 1996 and the predicted outcome was that the competition on the market would increase. However, today’s market is highly vertically integrated with three dominating firms; Vattenfall, E. ON, and Fortum. Moreover, the market has similar characteristics of an oligopoly with high entry barriers, limited room for product differentiation, and limited access of information. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and the Lerner Index show that the wholesale electricity market is highly concentrated and that market power exists. Besides external factors that affect the electricity price, such as emission trading and the amount of water in the reservoirs, the leading firms can with their market power manipulate the price. This can be done by preventing new entrants to enter the market which has led to underinvestment in new capacity with lower production costs...|$|E

Very strong regional differences in these indicators are observable between East and West Germany, as well as between North and South Germany.

40|$|In recent years, {{the pattern}} of M&As in Japan has changed significantly. Increasingly, {{managers}} and owners of Japanese firms seem to have realized that there are efficiency benefits with M&As, and that there exist strategic dimensions in doing M&As. Almost on a daily basis, newspapers report on new M&A deals, involving all industries in the country. However, the skepticism to M&As is still very deep-rooted, and there are fewer Out-In M&As than In-In M&As. The distribution of M&A activities among the industrial sectors is extremely uneven, {{as well as the}} distribution of the type of M&A. Overall, acquisitions and capital participation are the most common modes of M&A. Looking closer, {{the pattern of}} M&A depends on the industry and <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> <b>situation</b> in that particular industry. Further, in studying Japanese M&As, a distinction between large firms and small- and medium-sized firms is necessary. The reason for this is the difference in nature between these two groups of firms. While large firms are international enough to recognize a foreign firm as a suitable M&A partner or buyer, SMFs make M&A decisions out of a different set of perceptions. Therefore, the M&A behavior becomes more diverse in the latter group than in the large firms sector. The conclusions of this paper are twofold. First, apart from the M&A pattern itself, the cultural factors heavily influence the M&A decisions of all firms in Japan. Second, the future of Out-In M&As is much dependent on how much the Japanese economic performance improves. Japan; Mergers & Acquisitions; Keiretsu; Small-and Medium-sized firms. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the age of}} globalisation, it {{has been}} widely claimed in {{scholarly}} as well as public debate that the welfare state will retreat due to a convergence pressure by global economic forces. This thesis examines a convergence hypothesis {{in the area of}} foreign direct investment (FDI), predicting a tax policy convergence due to mobility of FDI. The hypothesis claims that mobility of attractive economic resources confers structural power upon transnational corporations (TNC). This power is assumed to be due to the ability of TNCs to make discriminatory location choices causing allocation of FDI, avoiding relatively high taxation regimes. According to the convergence hypothesis, tax policies will converge on TNC preferences (assumed by the convergence hypothesis to be low taxation and thus threatening the fundamentals for diversified welfare ambitions) since inward foreign direct investment is by states highly attracted economic activity. <b>The</b> <b>competition</b> <b>situation</b> among states for FDI will result in lower taxation and hence a restraint on states' ability to pursue ambitious welfare policies. This thesis tests the issue of whether investment choices by TNCs are discriminatory in correspondence to the convergence hypothesis, i. e. that there is a reluctance to invest in jurisdictions with relatively high taxation. The study leaves out the question of actual preferences of transnational corporations, and focuses only on the actions of TNCs through allocation of foreign direct investment. The states of the European Union prior to the accession of ten new member states in 2004 has been chosen for a quantitative study analysing correlation between level of taxation and success in attracting foreign direct investment. This study observes no correlation between high levels of taxation and low success in attracting FDI. Instead, the only connection seems to be between high levels of taxation and high success in attracting FDI. While more studies are necessary to conduct in the area, this thesis constitutes a logical questioning of the convergence hypothesis tested, and stresses the need for further research on the survival of the welfare state in the age of globalisation.

The divalent counterions competed with Tris+ and Na+ for binding to polyion DNA, and <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> binding <b>situations</b> were investigated {{by measuring the}} reduction of the DNA mobility, by pulsed- or constant-field gel electrophoresis. The interaction of Mg 2 + with DNA was intensively studied over a wide range of Mg 2 + concentrations. In addition, we examined <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> binding as a function of ionic strength and DNA size. To compare valence effects, we studied Co(NH 3) 63 + interaction with DNA fragments under conditions similar to that of Mg 2 +. At relatively low Mg 2 + concentration, the normalized titration curves of DNA mobility were well fit by Manning's two-variable counterion condensation (CC) theory. The agreement between the predicted value (total charge neutralization fraction θ) from Manning's CC theory and the data based on our measured DNA electrophoretic mobility reduction was consistent under our experimental conditions. In contrast to alkaline earth metal cations (Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +), different binding behaviors were observed for the transition metal cations (Zn 2 + and Cu 2 +). These differences highlight the usefulness of our reduced DNA electrophoretic mobility measurement approach to describing cation interactions with polyelectrolyte DNA...|$|R
