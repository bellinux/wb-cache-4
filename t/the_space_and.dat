5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for <b>the</b> <b>space,</b> <b>and</b> when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E

Major General Roger Burg, commander of the Twentieth Air Force, Major General Kathleen Close, commander of the Ogden Air Logistics Center, Brigadier General Francis Bruno, Director of Logistics, Air Force Materiel Command, and Brigadier General Arthur Cameron III, Air Force director of resource integration, also received letters of admonishment.|$|E
5|$|The five {{locomotives}} {{and spare}} parts acquired by Roger Broggie {{were sent to}} the Tampa Ship Repair & Dry Dock Company in Tampa, Florida, to receive the aesthetic and mechanical restorations necessary to run on the planned Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR). At the time, this was the closest facility to the Walt Disney World site in Bay Lake, Florida with <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> equipment needed to accommodate full-size railroad rolling stock. Here Transportation Superintendent Earl Vilmer, who had accompanied Broggie on his trip to Mexico, along with Project Engineer Bob Harpur and the facility's Machinist Supervisor George Britton were tasked with the project's completion.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{is used to}} calculate <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>and</b> width of cracks for a series of reinforced concrete beams having different material and sectional properties. The calculated values are used to investigate the effects of different variables on <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>and</b> width of cracks. Bar diameter, effective width of the beam per bar, concrete cover and the effective depth are shown to be the most significant parameters affecting <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>and</b> width of cracks at a given load level. A parametric study is subsequently carried out utilising the above significant parameters, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>and</b> width of cracks are re-calculated. Results of this parametric study are used to develop simplified prediction formulae. Finally a comparative study is undertaken, which indicates that <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>and</b> width of cracks calculated by the new formulae agree well with the test results of other investigatorsGriffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> symmetric rhythm as {{they support the}} weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (ardha-mandapa) on the south side, while a pillared portico (mukha-mandapa) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest {{of which is the}} square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square garbha-griya (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (pradakshina-patha) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.|$|E

25|$|A {{consequence}} of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum, {{and that their}} ratio is a constant: E/p=c. Rearranging, E/c=p, and since for photons, <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> time components are equal, E/c must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.|$|E
