25|$|Pick Up <b>the</b> <b>Pace</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} EP by Australian {{alternative}} rock band The Predators. It {{was released on}} 1 July 2006 through Dew Process and Universal Music Australia. The EP was produced after Powderfinger entered a hiatus, and several of its band members sought work with side projects. Following the release of Pick Up the Pace, The Predators embarked on a minor tour around Australia, including a performance at Splendour in the Grass, before officially going on hiatus, around the time Powderfinger reformed.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> {{a lateral}} two-beat gait. In the pace, the two legs {{on the same}} side of the horse move forward together, unlike the trot, where the two legs diagonally {{opposite}} from each other move forward together. In both the pace and the trot, two feet are always off the ground. The trot is much more common, but some horses, particularly in breeds bred for harness racing, naturally prefer to pace. Pacers are also faster than trotters on the average, though horses are raced at both gaits. Among Standardbred horses, pacers breed truer than trotters – that is, trotting sires have a higher proportion of pacers among their get than pacing sires do of trotters.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{the release}} of the book the {{reception}} was positive. It was agreed that, compared to other books in the series, the pace was faster. Many subplots were resolved, something Zack Handlen writing for The A.V. Club found satisfying, saying that the book had [...] "a blessed willingness to tie up loose ends," [...] something he felt Jordan had been unwilling to do. In a positive review, Seth Bracken of Deseret News explained that <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> jarring but it also [...] "creates a sense of urgency." [...] Reviewers noted that Sanderson's style comes through in the novel, Handlen felt Sanderson's prose [...] "lacks some of the descriptive punch" [...] compared to Jordan's. Michael Mason-D'Croz writing for the Lincoln Journal Star went on to say Sanderson's [...] "voice comes through in certain ways", describing the book as the [...] "ultimate fan fiction." ...|$|E
500|$|The Narragansett Pacer was not {{exclusively}} a pacing horse, as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait, {{which is a}} four-beat, intermediate-speed gait, while <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> a two-beat, intermediate-speed gait. The amble is more comfortable to ride than the pace, and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses. They averaged around [...] tall, and were generally chestnut in color. James Fenimore Cooper described them as: [...] "They have handsome foreheads, the head clean, the neck long, the arms and legs thin and tapered."; however, another source stated, [...] "The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked...", but also said, [...] "They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high. But what is more remarkable is that they amble with more speed than most horses trot, {{so that it is}} difficult to put some of them upon a gallop." [...] Other viewers of the breed rarely called them stylish or good-looking, although they considered them dependable, easy to work with and sure-footed.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Hilary Rothing from UGO Networks enjoyed the perceived parallels to The Wire and praised the further development of Anna Torv's character Olivia; [...] "With tonight's premiere, the writing feels tighter, <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> fast {{but not so much}} so that the story begins to trip over itself - and if that's any indication of how the rest of the season shapes up, then Fox will have my full attention every Thursday from 9-10pm". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, writing that he enjoyed how the writers made the show [...] "new-viewer-friendly without making existing fans too impatient". After receiving a DVD copy of the premiere in advance, IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.0/10, explaining [...] "Everything that made season one special is still here: Walter's still crazy and obsessed with food, Peter's still a smart-ass, and Olivia...well, there's a lot going on with Olivia, as usual". Isler thought newcomer Meghan Markle was [...] "cute, and spunky, but... not quite a good fit here", and praised the cliffhanger as [...] "surprising in a special way". MTV's Josh Wigler praised all the main actors' performances, and thought the episode gave the second season a [...] "strong start".|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. In The New York Times Book Review, author Stephen King stated the Goblet of Fire was [...] "every bit {{as good as}} Potters1 through 3" [...] and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that [...] "there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing". Kirkus Reviews called it [...] "another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two [...] "bad guys" [...] stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave [...] "many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable". For The Horn Book Magazine, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying [...] "some will find [...] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs". A Publishers Weekly review praised the book's [...] "red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience" [...] and saying it [...] "might be her most thrilling yet." [...] Writing for The New Yorker, Joan Acocella noted that [...] "where the prior volumes moved like lightning, here <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E
2500|$|In literature, pace, or pacing is {{the speed}} at which a story is told. [...] <b>The</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} by the length of the scenes, how fast the action moves, and how quickly the reader is provided with information. [...] It is also sometimes determined by the genre of the story. [...] Comedies move faster than dramas; action adventures move faster than suspense. [...] The number of words needed to write about a certain event does not depend upon how much time the event takes to happen; it depends upon how important that moment is to the story.|$|E

2500|$|With one exception, a {{fast pace}} is uncomfortable for riding and very {{difficult}} to sit, because the rider is moved rapidly {{from side to side}}. The motion feels somewhat as if the rider is on a camel, another animal that naturally paces. However, a camel is much taller than a horse and so even at relatively fast speeds, a rider can follow the rocking motion of a camel. A pacing horse, being smaller and taking quicker steps, moves from side to side at a rate that becomes difficult for a rider to follow at speed, so though the gait is faster and useful for harness racing, it becomes impractical as a gait for riding at speed over long distances. However, {{in the case of the}} Icelandic horse, where <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> known as the skeið, [...] "flying pace" [...] or flugskeið, it is a smooth and highly valued gait, ridden in short bursts at great speed.|$|E

60|$|But, {{whenever}} it be possible, let the hounds themselves be your mark, and endeavour {{to remember that}} the leading hounds are those which should guide you. A single hound who turns when he is heading the pack should teach you to turn also. Of all the hounds you see there in the open, probably not one-third are hunting. The others are doing as you do, following where their guides lead them. It is for you to follow the real guide, and not the followers, if only you can keep the real guide in view. To keep the whole pack in view and to ride among them is easy enough when the scent is slack and <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> slow. At such times let me counsel you to retire somewhat from the crowd, giving place to those eager men who are breaking the huntsman's heart. When the hounds have come nearer to their fox, and <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> again good, then they will retire and make room for you.|$|E

60|$|A {{professional}} guide who overtook them {{recognized the}} capabilities of the man when he noticed the way in which he lifted his feet and how he set them down. This, the guide decided, was a man accustomed to walking among the heather, but he was wrong; for it was the trick the bushman learns when he plods through leagues of undergrowth and fallen branches, or the tall grass of the swamps; and it is a memorable experience to make a day's journey with such a man. For the first hour the thing seems easy, as <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> never forced, but the speed never slackens; and as the hours go by the novice, who flounders and stumbles, grows horribly weary of {{trying to keep up with}} the steady, persistent swing.|$|E
60|$|My head {{is singing}} with Otto; {{for the first}} two weeks I wrote and revised and only {{finished}} IV chapters: last week, I have just drafted straight ahead, and I have just finished Chapter XI. It will want a heap of oversight and much will not stand, but <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> good; about 28 Cornhill pp. drafted in seven days, and almost all of it dialogue--indeed I may say all, for I have dismissed the rest very summarily in the draft: one can always tickle at that. At the same rate, the draft should be finished in ten days more; and then I shall have the pleasure of beginning again at the beginning. Ah damned job! I have no idea whether or not Otto will be good. It is all pitched pretty high and stilted; almost like the Arabs, at that; but of course there is love-making in Otto, and indeed a good deal of it. I sometimes feel very weary; but the thing travels--and I like it when I am at it.|$|E
60|$|Men toil hard at {{harvest the}} world over, but, perhaps, {{nowhere is the}} work so fierce, or demands so much from those engaged in it, as on the wide levels which stretch back from the wheat lands of Western Canada into the Dakotas across the border. There flesh and blood must keep pace with unwearying machines, the latest and most ingenious that man's brain can conceive. The reaper has gone, the binder that is {{a year or two}} out of date is broken up, and, while the machine does more and more, the {{strength}} of the men who serve and drive it remains the same. For all that, none of them can afford to be left behind. They have no use for the incompetent in that country, and, though at times <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> apt to kill, man must strain overtaxed muscle and sinew in the tense effort to keep up with wooden arms that never ache, and with clashing steel. The toilers are, for the most part, well paid and generously fed, and they give all that is in them, from pride of manhood, and in some degree from sheer necessity. The ban that is still a privilege has never been lifted yet, and, while wheat may glut the markets and flour be cheap, it is alone by the sweat of somebody's strenuous effort that man has bread to eat.|$|E

60|$|From Sherbrooke we {{went with}} the mails on a pair-horse wagon to Magog. Cross-country mails are not {{interesting}} to the generality of readers, but I have a professional liking for them myself. I have spent {{the best part of}} my life in looking after, and I hope in improving, such mails; and I always endeavor to do a stroke of work when I come across them. I learned on this occasion that the conveyance of mails with a pair of horses, in Canada, costs little more than half what is paid for the same work in England with one horse, and something less than what is paid in Ireland, also for one horse. But in Canada the average pace is only five miles an hour. In Ireland it is seven, and the time is accurately kept, which {{does not seem to be}} the case in Canada. In England <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> eight miles an hour. In Canada and in Ireland these conveyances carry passengers; but in England they are prohibited from doing so. In Canada the vehicles are much better got up than they are in England, and the horses too look better. Taking Ireland as a whole, they are more respectable in appearance there than in England. From all which it appears that pace is the article that costs the highest price, and that appearance does not go for much in the bill. In Canada the roads are very bad in comparison with the English or Irish roads; but, to make up for this, the price of forage is very low.|$|E
60|$|The Littlebath world lives {{mostly in}} lodgings, and Miss Baker and Caroline lived {{there as the}} world mostly does. There are three sets of persons who resort to Littlebath: there is the heavy fast, and the lighter fast set; {{there is also the}} pious set. Of the two fast sets neither is scandalously fast. <b>The</b> <b>pace</b> <b>is</b> never very awful. Of the heavies, it may be said that the gentlemen {{generally}} wear their coats padded, are frequently seen standing idle about the parades and terraces, that they always keep a horse, and trot about the roads a good deal when the hounds go out. The ladies are addicted to whist and false hair, but pursue their pleasures with a discreet economy. Of the lighter fast set, assembly balls are the ruling passion; but even in these there is no wild extravagance. The gentlemen of this division keep usually two horses, on the sale of one of which their mind is much bent. They drink plentifully of cherry-brandy on hunting days; but, as a rule, they do not often misbehave themselves. They are very careful not to be caught in marriage, and talk about women much as a crafty knowing salmon might be presumed to talk about anglers. The ladies are given to dancing, of course, and are none of them nearly so old as you might perhaps be led to imagine. They greatly eschew card-playing; but, nevertheless, now and again one of them may be seen to lapse from her sphere and fall into that below, if we may justly say that the votaries of whist are below the worshippers of Terpsichore. Of the pious set much needs not be said, as their light has never been hid under a bushel. In spite of hunt-clubs and assembly-rooms, they are the predominant power. They live on the fat of the land. They are a strong, unctuous, moral, uncharitable people. The men never cease making money for themselves, nor the women making slippers for their clergymen.|$|E
