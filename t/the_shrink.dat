25|$|Gru and the Minions steal <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> ray from {{a secret}} base in East Asia, but Vector {{intercepts}} them and steals it for himself. Gru attempts {{to break into}} Vector's fortress to recover <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> ray but is defeated by numerous booby traps. However, he notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, {{who are able to}} easily walk into the base because they are selling cookies. Gru disguises himself and adopts the girls, planning on using them to infiltrate Vector's base so he can get <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> ray back. However, Gru has trouble nurturing them properly due to their rambunctiousness, their ballet classes, and his own ineptitude as a parent.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Gru and {{the girls}} arrive at Vector's fortress, and Gru steals <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> ray. The girls then suggest a day at a theme park; Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girls there, but instead he warms up to them. Later, Gru {{contacts}} Perkins via video chat, stating that he finally has <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, and Perkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund his operations. As Gru tells the Minions {{he can no longer}} pay them for their services, the girls offer the contents of their piggy bank. Gru, inspired, sells parts of his lair to construct a spacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest the Earth, but this is the same day as the girls' ballet recital. Gru becomes conflicted, and Dr. Nefario, seeing the recital as interfering with the plan, arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage. At the same time, Perkins informs Vector, revealed to be Perkins' son, of Gru's possession of <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> ray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to act.|$|E
25|$|Gru {{successfully}} shrinks and steals the Moon, {{and rushes}} back to Earth {{to attend the}} recital—only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's headquarters, Gru surrenders the Moon, but Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered {{that the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> ray are temporary; the bigger the object's original size, the faster the shrinkage will wear off. As the Moon starts to expand in Vector's ship, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls just as the Moon explodes out of Vector's ship and launches itself back into orbit, with Vector trapped on it.|$|E
