25|$|Running {{alongside}} {{his enthusiasm for}} DVD, Scott {{is known for his}} use of the director's cut. The positive reaction to the Blade Runner Director's Cut encouraged Scott <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> several movies that were a disappointment {{at the time of their}} release (including Legend and Kingdom of Heaven), which have been met with acclaim. Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.|$|E
25|$|The {{company that}} hired him for Tonight for Sure {{brought him back}} <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> a German film titled Mit Eva fing die Sünde an {{directed}} by Fritz Umgelter. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for The Bellboy and the Playgirls, also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, Nebo zovyot, which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled Battle Beyond the Sun, released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on Tower of London (1962), sound man for The Young Racers (1963) and associate producer of The Terror (1963).|$|E
500|$|On January 12, 2010, Haiti {{was struck}} by a {{magnitude}} 7.0 Mw earthquake. It was the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years and caused widespread damage. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. It has been estimated that the death toll could reach 200,000. Before the earthquake, Jones and Richie had planned to organize a re-recording of [...] "We Are the World" [...] on January 28, 2010— the 25th anniversary of the original recording of the song. Randy Phillips, who was a key figure in the song being re-issued, said that [...] "We Are The World" [...] producer Ken Kragen had suggested <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> [...] "We Are the World" [...] and title it [...] "Live 25". However, Lionel Richie and Jones were [...] "very lukewarm" [...] about the idea. Phillips commented that, ...|$|E

50|$|Although their {{patterns}} are clearly very ancient, {{there seems to}} be no reliable way of accurately dating a turf maze, because they have <b>to</b> be <b>re-cut</b> regularly <b>to</b> keep the design clear, which is liable to disturb any archaeological evidence. A maze could pre-date its earliest written record by years or even centuries.|$|R
50|$|Forest of the Dead was {{complete}} on January, 2002. In 2005, 5 new scenes were shot for a director's cut. Due to various technical difficulties, the film had <b>to</b> be <b>re-cut</b> from scratch by Brian Singleton in 2005. It took 5 months to finish and was then submitted to Elite Entertainment, who then signed for its release in 2007.|$|R
2500|$|Hill then {{directed}} the 2000 film Supernova. When the studio {{did not agree}} with his vision, they brought in Francis Ford Coppola <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> the film. This caused Hill to withdraw from the project and credit himself with the pseudonym [...] "Thomas Lee" [...] (a variation of Alan Smithee), and chose not {{to be associated with the}} finished product. Hill called his original version a much darker take than the final product.|$|E
2500|$|Fortissimo {{sold the}} US {{distribution}} rights to Miramax Films during the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Miramax then sent word that {{it wanted to}} alter the film. Wisit offered the company an even shorter version than the international cut, but the company refused. [...] "They didn't allow me <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> it at all", Wisit {{said in an interview}} with the Los Angeles Times. [...] "They did it by themselves and then sent me the tape. And they changed the ending from tragic to happy. They said that in the time after 9/11, nobody would like to see something sad." ...|$|E
50|$|Miramax is {{also accused}} of {{ignoring}} their more artistic, less audience-friendly films, especially when directors refuse <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> {{them to make}} them less challenging. Dead Man, which director Jim Jarmusch refused <b>to</b> <b>re-cut,</b> got a very limited release and critics have accused the Weinsteins of burying the film.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 <b>to</b> 1938, Monotype <b>re-cut</b> {{the type}} for modern-day usage, {{and it has}} become a popular book typeface. Ehrhardt has a {{slightly}} condensed design, giving it a strongly vertical, crisp appearance.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s it {{was criticized}} for this reason and it was <b>re-cut</b> <b>to</b> remove the {{idealized}} portrayal of Soviet collective farms {{at the beginning and}} to include references to the Hungarian Uprising of 1956.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{had trouble}} getting {{distribution}} but was eventually picked up by Universal, who arranged for it <b>to</b> be <b>re-cut.</b> The world premiere took place in Canberra in 1933, in front of Governor General Sir Isaac Isaacs and various parliamentarians. Initial critical reception was generally positive, The Canberra Times praising it as [...] "a welcome... in the subjects adopted by Australian film producers. and it received a minor release in Sydney the following year.|$|R

5000|$|Darryl F.

(Zanuck had just forced Joseph L. Mankiewicz <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> Cleopatra (1963)).|$|E
50|$|Pery was keen for Columbia to make further {{films in}} Australia. Harry Cohn, head of Columbia, however, {{was opposed to}} the idea. He later {{arranged}} for Smithy <b>to</b> be drastically <b>re-cut</b> and re-edited for its US release, calling it Pacific Adventure, removing references to Australia, along with Pery's credit.|$|R
50|$|Episodes are {{broadcast}} nationally on the Syfy {{channel in}} the United States. They are regularly shown in late-night slots, and in marathons aired typically {{every year on}} New Year's Eve and Day and the Fourth of July. Syfy broadcasts are often <b>re-cut</b> <b>to</b> feature more commercials during the time slot.|$|R
50|$|Cameron {{was able}} to make a deal with a distributor, who agreed to buy his footage and allow him <b>to</b> re-score and <b>re-cut</b> the picture-basically restructure it to what was {{originally}} intended-before release, so his alternative vision eventually came out on home video in some regions, which made a profit for the distributor.|$|R
50|$|Composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had {{previously}} collaborated with Donner on The Omen, completed a score for the film, but had it replaced by a different score composed by Brian Tyler after Donner was forced <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> the film {{at the insistence of}} Sherry Lansing, the then-head of Paramount Pictures.. However, both Goldsmith and Tyler's scores were released on CD.|$|E
5000|$|The river has had <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> {{its course}} several times due to {{repeated}} eruptions of Mount Fuji, and river terraces are in evidence along its upper reaches in Yamanashi. As the river crosses Kanagawa, it forms natural levees {{in the soft}} soils of the alluvial plains of central Kanagawa, and forms almost no river delta as it exits into the ocean.|$|E

5000|$|... "Butterfly" [...] is Japanese pop {{musician}} Kumi Koda's sixteenth domestic single. The single came in CD and CD+DVD, {{with the}} latter editions containing a foldout poster. Because her previous single [...] "Hot Stuff feat.

25|$|Unlike the DVD edition, the German TV {{release was}} <b>re-cut</b> <b>to</b> include some {{flashback}} scenes at points where they mattered within the story, {{and not in}} the chronological order in which they happened. For example, Stanley's capture by the pirates was shown as a flashback in the fourth episode ("Gigashadow") of the miniseries, whereas the DVD version includes it prior to the Cluster scenes early on in the first episode of the show, somewhat out of context.|$|R
50|$|The {{musical score}} was {{composed}} by Mario Millo. The original soundtrack recording was produced for compact disc release courtesy of Antony I Ginnane by Philip Powers and Mario Millo for Australian distribution in Australia by 1M1 Records {{and as a}} coupling with Shame on LP in the US. The movie was <b>re-cut</b> <b>to</b> a shorter length for the US release, which Wincer thought made the second half better, {{although he did not}} like the opening as much.|$|R
50|$|In Land of Black Gold, {{the detectives}} mistakenly swallow some mysterious fuel-related pills that {{caused them to}} sprout immensely long beards and hair that change color {{constantly}} and grow at a break-neck pace. The condition wears off {{by the end of}} this adventure, but it relapses in Explorers on the Moon, causing problems when the captain must continuously cut their hair, repeatedly switching back <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> floor length hair (and mustaches and beards) which all grow back in seconds.|$|E

50|$|Wheel lathes are {{machines}} used {{to manufacture}} and resurface {{the wheels of}} railway cars. When wheels become worn or compromised from excessive use, this tool can be used <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> and recondition {{the wheel of the}} train car. There are a number of different wheel lathes available including underfloor variations for resurfacing wheels that are still attached to the rail car, portable types that are easily transported for emergency wheel repairs, and CNC versions which utilize computer-based operating systems to complete the wheel repair.|$|E
5000|$|The furrows {{and lands}} are {{arranged}} in repeating patterns called harps. A typical millstone will have six, eight or ten harps. The pattern of harps is repeated {{on the face of}} each stone, when they are laid face to face the patterns mesh in a kind of [...] "scissoring" [...] motion creating the cutting or grinding function of the stones. When in regular use stones need to be dressed periodically, that is, <b>re-cut</b> <b>to</b> keep the cutting surfaces sharp.|$|R
5000|$|Lazare Kaplan {{was chosen}} to cut the diamond into several gemstones. [...] The process of {{examining}} the diamond to determine the optimal cuts took place {{over the course of}} several months. On 27 April 1936, the first cut was made which cut off a 35-carat section, finally ending with the diamond being cut into 13 pieces. The largest piece produced the Jonker I, a 142.90 ct D-color flawless diamond which was later <b>re-cut</b> <b>to</b> 125.35 carats.|$|R

50|$|The Wittelsbach family {{tried to}} sell the diamond in 1931 during the Great Depression but found no buyers. It {{eventually}} sold the jewel in 1951. In 1958, the stone was exhibited at the World Expo in Brussels. In the 1960s, the Goldmuntz family asked Joseph Komkommer, a jeweller, <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> the diamond, but Komkommer recognised its historical significance and refused. Instead, he joined a group of dealers that bought it. The diamond {{had been in a}} private collection since 1964; Helmut Horten had presented to his wife Heidi at their wedding.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{production}} of Superman Returns, director Bryan Singer acquired the rights from Marlon Brando's estate to use the late actor's footage from Superman into the film. Shortly after, Ilya Salkind confirmed that Donner {{was involved in the}} project <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> Superman II using Brando's unused footage. Editor Michael Thau worked on the project alongside Donner and Tom Mankiewicz, who supervised the Superman II reconstruction. Despite some initial confusion, Thau confirmed that all the footage shot by Donner in 1977 was recovered and transferred from a vault in England.|$|E
5000|$|Writer/director Luna {{was puzzled}} by the {{negative}} reaction. He noted that the film's theme was one of empowerment, not victimhood. Luna said that he checked with {{many members of the}} Dallas transgender community, including those who worked on the film, regarding {{the use of the word}} [...] "trannies" [...] in the title and they had no issue with it, although he acknowledged that others within the community did object to it. He did, however, decide <b>to</b> <b>re-cut</b> the trailer to remove references to murder victims Zapata and Mercado.|$|E

[...] "I also bought another pair of clips the Duchess had owned," [...] Laurence Graff explains. [...] "Of course they needed <b>re-cutting</b> <b>to</b> bring them to their full potential, I bought all four, repolished them, and eventually made the Windsor earrings." ...|$|R
50|$|On 12 March 2015, {{two members}} of the CBFC, Ashoke Pandit and Chandraprakash Dwivedi, criticised the way in which Nihalani was running the organisation.http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-rift-in-censor-board-ashoke-pandit-calls-pahlaj-nihalani-tyrant-2068291 On 9 July 2015, he {{implemented}} a new rule under which A-rated films were no longer allowed for television broadcast. Earlier, A-rated films could be <b>re-cut,</b> <b>to</b> achieve U or U/A rating and released on television. Nihalani justified his decision by saying that past A-rated films contained horror or violence, but most recent A-rated films have sexual themes and so they cannot be re-cut. He changed this view later and has allowed re-certification of films presently.|$|R
