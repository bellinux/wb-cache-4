5|$|Under Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer {{was firmly}} {{committed}} {{to the standards of}} ethical drugs, as opposed to patent medicines. Ethical drugs were drugs that could be obtained only through a pharmacist, usually with a doctor's prescription. Advertising drugs directly to consumers was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> Aspirin directly to doctors.|$|E
5|$|Jobs rants <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> {{executive}} Joanna Hoffman about a Time {{magazine article}} exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan – he denies {{he is the}} father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, Lisa. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{story and}} cut scene {{animations}} were created in-house. The plot was originally written by Fox, {{who had also}} written most of the Sly Cooper stories, and reviewed by Fleming. As they continued to develop the game, they rewrote pieces of the story to reflect changes in the game, {{making sure that the}} story remained enjoyable. As the game became more complex, they brought in Bill Harms, a published comic book author, who had previously written for Supreme Commander and other video games. Harms assisted with the story and in-game dialog in addition <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> materials. Fleming noted that {{the second half of the}} story underwent significant changes in the last nine months of development; for example, when voice actor Caleb Moody voiced the lines for Zeke, he ad libbed additional lines that the team found to be enjoyable, and they reworked the story to incorporate them. The cut scenes were created in a similar format to the comics that the game was influenced by, and used to further extend the atmosphere of the superhero motif. The cut scenes were created by taking 2D art created in Corel Painter and Adobe Photoshop and placing them into artificial 3D stages built in Adobe After Effects to create a pseudo-3D effect that allowed them to play with camera placement and effects, and addition of organic elements such as dust clouds and ink spots.|$|E

25|$|Social {{marketing}} {{has been}} shown to influence women's decision to breastfeed their children.

25|$|Farm <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads {{generally}} {{exist in}} rural areas. After {{the city or}} county acquires right-of-way, TxDOT builds and maintains the road. A number of these roads, generally west of US 281, are designated ranch <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads, and one—Ranch Road 1—is simply a ranch road, serving the LBJ Ranch. Farm <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads were first designated in 1941 and ranch <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads in 1942. A number of farm <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads in urban areas were re-designated in 1995 as urban roads but, amid much controversy, the markers were not changed.|$|R

25|$|The title First Among Sequels was {{met with}} stiff {{resistance}} from Fforde's publishers because it had 'sequel' in the title, and {{it was felt that}} telegraphing the 'sequelness' of the book might be a bad move.

25|$|Economic and {{financial}} sustainability. Can {{the results of}} technical cooperation continue to yield an economic benefit after the technical cooperation is withdrawn? For example, the benefits from {{the introduction of new}} crops may not be sustained if the constraints <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> the crops are not resolved. Similarly, economic, as distinct from financial, sustainability may be at risk if the end users continue to depend on heavily subsidized activities and inputs.|$|E
25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, {{cognitive and affective}} response <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that when we die we leave behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E

25|$|Worth {{also changed}} {{the dynamic of}} the {{relationship}} between client and clothes maker. Where previously the dressmaker (invariably female) would visit the client's home for a one-to-one consultation, with the exception of Empress Eugénie clients generally attended Worth's salon in rue de la Paix for a consultation and it also became a social meeting point for society figures. His approach <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> was also innovative – {{he was the first to}} use live mannequins in order to promote his gowns to clients. His wife was his early model in the 1850s, leading Lucy Bannerman to describe Vernet as the world's first professional model.|$|E
25|$|Krill catch {{increased}} rapidly. In the 1980s, a few additional nations started {{operating in}} the area: Poland, Chile, and South Korea. Their catches amounted to a few thousand tonnes annually; the lion's share went to the Soviet Union, followed by Japan. A peak in krill harvest was reached in 1982 with a total production of over 528,000 tonnes, of which the Soviet Union produced 93%. In the following two years, production declined. It is unclear whether {{this was due to}} the discovery of fluorides in the krill's exoskeleton or <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> problems. The trade recovered quickly, though, and reached more than 400,000 tonnes again in 1987.|$|E

25|$|Cells are the {{building}} blocks of all living organisms. Within these cells are coils of DNA, genetic information instructing for how our cells will develop and operate. A small segment of DNA is a gene which codes for the making of proteins and passing on traits to offspring in reproduction. The main goal of a gene is to reproduce and thrive in its environment in relative to competitors. Practical implications in crime investigation, disorders and increasingly talent prediction and career decision making have considered their association with genes and biology, but the idea of biology and marketing is a growing body of knowledge. Neuromarketing is a new phenomenon studying consumer’s reactions <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> stimuli.|$|E
25|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Marketing</b> Evolutions, {{the company}} that {{produces}} Q Scores measuring the familiarity and appeal of celebrities and brands, almost 74% of U.S. consumers are familiar with O'Brien. In spite of that high score, O'Brien hasn't done many commercials for corporate America; two recent examples are a 2009 appearance in a Super Bowl XLIII commercial for Bud Light, and one for American Express, which debuted {{on the same day}} as Conan. He donated his proceeds from the Super Bowl commercial to the Fresh Air Fund, a charity which sends inner-city New York children to the country for vacations. According to The Wall Street Journal, O'Brien was paid more than one million dollars to do the American Express commercial, which required him to spend three days in Jaipur, India filming it.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus <b>to</b> <b>marketing.</b> Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
