25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FDIC</b> {{announced}} its intent, on September 29, 2009, {{to assess the}} banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums {{in an effort to}} avoid DIF insolvency. <b>The</b> <b>FDIC</b> revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. <b>The</b> <b>FDIC</b> board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> insurance fund. <b>The</b> <b>FDIC</b> elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, {{at the time of the}} assessment.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{to comply}} with legislation, <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> amended its failure {{resolution}} procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds.

25|$|Deposit Payoff, {{as soon as}} the {{appropriate}} chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> is appointed receiver. <b>The</b> <b>FDIC</b> as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.|$|E
25|$|In Slattery (Meritor Savings) v. U.S., {{after losing}} before {{a three-judge panel}} of the Federal Circuit, the {{government}} petitioned for a rehearing en banc. The court has agreed to review whether the trial court had the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the breach of contract dispute. The government is further arguing that <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> is Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), an agency created by the executive branch that receives no funding, and will not receive any funding, from the government. <b>The</b> <b>FDIC</b> receives funding by charging banks fees to member banks. If the en banc court agrees and finds that appropriated funds {{may not be used}} to pay judgments against NAFI's, then any judgment in the Meritor Savings case will be produced by the banks regulated by <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> and not by Treasury dollars. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> could be found to be in breach, but it would be entitled to recover the judgment by member banks. In order to find <b>the</b> <b>FDIC</b> a NAFI, the government is arguing that Congress has no obligation to honor its promises to back deposits with the full faith and credit of the United States.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the first}} time the {{industry}} has agreed on an industry standard. The benchmark ratio for calculating the affordable payment is 38 percent of monthly gross household income. Once the affordable payment is determined, there are several steps the servicer can take to create that payment - extending the term, reducing the interest rate, and forbearing interest. In the event that the affordable payment is still beyond the borrower’s means, the borrower’s situation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis using a cash flow budget. This program resulted from a unified effort among the Enterprises, Hope Now and its 27 servicer partners, Treasury, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In addition, we’ve drawn on <b>the</b> <b>FDIC’s</b> experience and assistance from developing the IndyMac streamlined approach and have greatly benefited from <b>the</b> <b>FDIC’s</b> input and example. To accommodate the need for more flexibility among a larger number of servicers, the Streamlined Modification Program does differ from the IndyMac model in a few areas. However, it uses the same fundamental tools to achieve the same affordability target.|$|R
