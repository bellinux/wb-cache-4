5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> of Costa Rica, {{entomologist}} Robert Torrance stumbles upon a decomposing boar carcass {{covered with}} dark purple pustules. As he extracts an insect {{from one of}} the pustules, it erupts, spraying him with fluid. By nightfall, Torrance himself has developed the boils and tries to radio for help. When a group of soldiers arrive the next morning, Torrance is dead.|$|E
5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. <b>The</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>Forest</b> (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E

25|$|Landless peasants {{worked on}} large {{plantations}} during short harvest seasons and received wages {{as low as}} US$1 per day. In desperation, many of these poor laborers migrated east, seeking their own land near <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> In 1968, the World Health Organization found that polluted water led to 17% of all Nicaraguan deaths.|$|E
25|$|The Vietnamese {{legend of}} Our Lady of La Vang {{is based on}} an {{apparition}} to a group of Vietnamese Catholics fleeing persecution in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> in 1798.

25|$|The first {{recorded}} history {{is found in}} the chronicles of North African (Berber) traders, who, from early Roman times, conducted a caravan trade across the Sahara in salt, slaves, gold, and other goods. The southern terminals of the trans-Saharan trade routes were located {{on the edge of the}} desert, and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> The more important terminals—Djenné, Gao, and Timbuctu—grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed.|$|E
25|$|Some moved eastward {{into the}} hills, where they cleared forests {{in order to}} plant crops. Soil erosion forced them, however, to abandon their land and move deeper into the rainforest. Cattle ranchers then claimed the {{abandoned}} land. Peasants and ranchers continued this movement deep into <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> By the early 1970s, Nicaragua had become the United States' top beef supplier. The beef supported fast-food chains and pet food production. President Anastasio Somoza Debayle owned the largest slaughterhouse in Nicaragua, as well as six meat-packing plants in Miami, Florida.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate in}} Southeast Asia is mainly tropical–hot and humid {{all year round}} with {{plentiful}} rainfall. Northern Vietnam and the Myanmar Himalayas are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate, which has a cold winter with snow. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon. The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. <b>The</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> is the second largest on earth (with the Amazon being the largest). An exception {{to this type of}} climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape. Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like.|$|E

25|$|The {{other half}} of the zoo is the Wilds of Africa. Opened in 1990, it was the first exhibit to feature all of the major {{habitats}} of Africa. Visitors can visit the rain forests, mountains, woodlands, rivers, deserts, and bush of Africa. The Nature Trail takes visitors through <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> past two large, naturalistic gorilla habitats. Nile crocodiles, wattled cranes, and a few other animals are seen before the Forest Aviary. In the middle of the forest is the Kopje, home to rock hyraxes, klipspringers, and meerkats. The rain forest/watering hole is also home to hippopotamus and okapi, which, {{in the case of the}} latter,zoo is famous for in both its breeding and research. About 20 percent of okapi in zoos in the U.S. and Japan can trace their lineage back to it.|$|E
25|$|Research using {{mathematical}} modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers {{can serve as}} an example. The idea {{is that it is}} also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae.The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, the {{population}} is 4,796,580, the eighth most populous state in Mexico. The 20th century saw large population growth in Chiapas. From fewer than one million inhabitants in 1940, the state had about two million in 1980, and over 4 million in 2005. Overcrowded land in the highlands was relieved when the rainforest to the east was subject to land reform. Cattle ranchers, loggers, and subsistence farmers migrated to <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> area. The population of the Lacandon was only one thousand people in 1950, but by the mid-1990s this had increased to 200 thousand. As of 2010, 78% lives in urban communities with 22% in rural communities. While birthrates are still high in the state, they have come down in recent decades from 7.4 per woman in 1950. However, these rates still mean significant population growth in raw numbers. About half of the state's population is under age 20, {{with an average age}} of 19. In 2005, there were 924,967 households, 81% headed by men and the rest by women. Most households were nuclear families (70.7%) with 22.1% consisting of extended families.|$|E

The moist conditions of temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> generally support an understory of mosses, ferns and some shrubs. Temperate <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> can be temperate coniferous forests or temperate broadleaf and mixed forests.|$|R

500|$|Manning {{was always}} a close {{observer}} of life, and gifted with a photographic memory. She told her friend Kay Dick that [...] "I write out of experience, I have no fantasy. I don't think anything I've experienced has ever been wasted. However, her 1974 novel <b>The</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>Forest</b> showed off her creative skills in her portrayal of a fictional island in the Indian Ocean and its inhabitants. Set in 1953, the novel's central characters are a British couple; the book examines their personal experiences and tragedies {{against the background of}} a violent end to colonial British rule. The book is one of Manning's lesser-known books, and she was disappointed that it was not shortlisted for the Booker prize.|$|E
500|$|The posthumous {{popularity}} of Fortunes of War notwithstanding, most of Manning's books are rarely read and have received little critical attention. Of her books, only Fortunes of War, School for Love, The Doves of Venus, <b>The</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>Forest</b> and A Romantic Hero remain in print. [...] Some of her novels, most often Fortunes of War, have {{been translated into}} French, German, Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, Greek, Romanian and Hebrew. As in her lifetime, opinions are divided; some assert that her books are [...] "flawed by self-indulgence {{and a lack of}} self-judgment", and criticise portrayals of ethnic and religious groups as stereotyped and caricatured. Others praise tight, perceptive and convincing narratives and excellent characterisation. Her plots are often described as journeys, odysseys and quests in both literal and metaphorical senses. Manning's talent for [...] "exquisite evocations of place", including physical, cultural and historical aspects have been widely admired, and the critic Walter Allen complimented her [...] "painter's eye for the visible world".|$|E
