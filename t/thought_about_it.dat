Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what {{everybody}} else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right?

25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E

500|$|It was {{initially}} unknown whether Weinberg {{would be part}} of O'Brien's new late night show on TBS cable that began in November 2010, as no specifics had been worked out for that show while O'Brien focused on his tour. In June 2010, the Max Weinberg Big Band Tour began with a show in Red Bank, New Jersey's Count Basie Theater. Weinberg said that he was booking appearances by his big band through 2011 and that with regard to O'Brien, [...] "I literally have not <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> There have been no discussions.

Although Harris admits that he [...] "wasn't really into it" [...] at first, he then thought, [...] "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce {{and we know what}} he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.'

500|$|The {{idea of a}} Jerry-centered episode arose {{when the}} writers decided one of the {{characters}} would get mugged. Muharrar said, [...] "Once we <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it seemed like it was time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] that Jerry was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{called this}} idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E

500|$|The writers {{originally}} {{drew up a}} list of ten British celebrities {{they wanted}} to appear in the episode. The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams (a fan of the show) was included in a draft of the script acting as a tour guide and showing some of his relatives around London. Williams had to reject the part due to other engagements. The script also included a role for a musician; the staff had hoped to get David Bowie or Morrissey for the part but nothing came together. David and Victoria Beckham were also originally sought to guest star in the episode, and would be seen bickering on the street. The idea was dropped after Blair agreed to guest star, and it was deemed that they were not famous enough in the United States and so were not approached. Jean commented [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> we didn't ask. I've heard of him because my daughter plays soccer." ...|$|E

And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ...

500|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought {{the news to}} the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{for a few minutes}} and then announced to Placzek, Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that [...] "I have understood everything." [...] Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on [...] "The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission".|$|E

We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media.

She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video.
