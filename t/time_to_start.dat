Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|At the season's second race (at Rockingham Speedway), {{she started}} second but {{finished}} 36th after {{being involved in}} a crash. Two races later, Robinson won her first career pole position (and the first for {{a woman in the}} Busch Series) in the Busch Light 300 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. On the race's first lap, she battled with Joe Nemechek and Mike Wallace through the track's third turn when Wallace collided with Robinson which sent her into Nemechek. Robinson continued with heavy damage to the front-end of her car, but retired after completing 63 laps with radiator damage. She attempted to qualify for the Busch North Series race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway but did not record a fast enough lap <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the race. Robinson achieved her first top-ten finish in the Busch Series later in the season with a tenth-place result in the Fay's 150 at Watkins Glen. However, she was released from the team shortly afterward due to a loss of sponsorship, and ended the year 47th overall. Robinson took time off to rebuild her psyche and self-confidence, and worked on interior decorating as a hobby. She married engine builder Jeff Clark in November 1994.|$|E

25|$|The planned {{demonstration}} of the DH.110 on that day was nearly cancelled when the aircraft at Farnborough, WG 240, an all-black night fighter prototype, became unserviceable. It was de Havilland's second DH.110 prototype, and had been taken supersonic over the show on the opening day.

25|$|Nevertheless, Wisniewski {{wanted to}} pitch again {{and decided to}} jump to the rival National Girls Baseball League {{in the spring of}} 1950. Although it was billed as a {{baseball}} league, the NGBL featured underhand pitching and used a ball larger than that used in the AAGPBL. Wisniewski joined the Admiral Music Maids as a pitcher-outfielder, won 30 games during the regular season, but missed the AAGPBL. Eventually, she returned to the Chicks in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the 1951 AAGPBL season.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Edward Haltom was {{studying}} monorail systems. Haltom {{noticed that the}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> and stop a conventional large monorail train, {{like those of the}} Wuppertal Schwebebahn, meant that a single line could only support between 20 and 40 vehicles an hour. In order to get reasonable passenger movements on such a system, the trains had to be large enough to carry hundreds of passengers (see headway for a general discussion). This, in turn, demanded large guideways that could support the weight of these large vehicles, driving up capital costs {{to the point where he}} considered them unattractive.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, Farnham {{had started}} {{collecting}} a songlist {{for a future}} solo album while still in Little River Band, he finished his vocals for their album, No Reins, and left the band late that year. Farnham's first solo performances since 1981 were live shows with the John Farnham Band consisting of Brett Garsed on lead guitar, Sam See on guitar and Derek Pellicci, formerly of Little River Band, on drums. In early 1986, sound engineer Ross Fraser suggested to Wheatley that it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> working on the solo album. Wheatley searched vainly for a producer and record label {{willing to work with}} Farnham, Fraser took on the producer role and Wheatley provided financial support after mortgaging his house.|$|E
25|$|However, other clubs {{also began}} to make their {{presence}} felt in the locality. One in particular, the Great Northern Railway Association Club, otherwise known as the Dundalk GNR, founded in September 1903, spawned the modern-day Dundalk Football Club. The Dundalk GNR were located at the Athletic Grounds and competed in the Dundalk and District League from 1905 until 1914, although media coverage remained patchy. Sports coverage was re-instated in the local media in 1919, with the Dundalk and District League re-established in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a competition during the 1919â€“20 season. Included among the teams was a selection representing the Dundalk GNR. The club were also partaking in the Newry League at the time, but political change at a national level was to affect this. Following {{the formation of the}} Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS; later to become the Football Association of Ireland or FAI) in Dublin to govern football in the Irish Free State the control of footballing matters in Northern Ireland was left to the Irish Football Association (IFA).|$|E
25|$|The top 10 drivers {{set their}} early quick laps. Hamilton took the early lead with Vettel and Rosberg close behind. With only {{two minutes to}} go it {{looked to be a}} close to who would take pole position. The top three were {{unchanged}} with Vettel very quick on track while Rosberg was going even quicker. However, Barrichello spun off and hit the wall hard, destroying much of {{the left side of his}} car, which brought out the yellow flags meaning anyone who was on a flying lap had to slow down unless they had already passed the scene of the accident. The red flag was brought out with 26 seconds remaining on the clock. As no other cars crossed the line, Hamilton took pole position ahead of Vettel, Rosberg and Mark Webber. Although Barrichello qualified fifth, he started the race tenth after his gearbox change. The session was restarted with only 26 seconds left there was no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a flying lap so no one rejoined the circuit. This session was the third of four to be red flagged during the weekend, only the third practice session was not interrupted.|$|E

This triggered the horizontal <b>time</b> base <b>to</b> <b>start</b> its sweep across the screen, ensuring that the lines started on the left of the display.

25|$|He {{started his}} career as a guitarist, winning a TV contest for young music talents at the age of 14. He was rapidly put under {{contract}} {{to be part of the}} pop-rock band Lazy, of which drummer Munetaka Higuchi was also a member. Lazy produced five successful albums at the end of the 70s, but Takasaki's musical style, oriented towards hard rock and heavy metal, did not gel with the band and in 1981 he decided to make his original band, Loudness, alongside bandmate Higuchi. The many heavy metal albums produced by Loudness brought him international fame and vast critical acclaim. He is the only member of Loudness that has been in the band since its inception, producing more than 20 studio albums in 25 years. Takasaki has also continued the production of solo works, starting with Tusk of Jaguar in 1982 and is now committed to a new side project called Ji-Zo. In 1998 and in 2002, he was also directly involved in the reunion of Lazy for the release of two new studio albums and for a tour. Takasaki found enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> Killer Guitars, a company co-founded and managed with fellow guitarist George Azuma. He is responsible for several of the guitar designs.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the mobile battery from Queluz, the pieces were {{arranged}} in the palace gardens so that they could bombard the quarters of the revolutionary sailors, which were located at no more than 100 metres from the palace. However, before they had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>start,</b> the commander of the battery received the order to cancel the bombing and join the forces that were leaving the palace, integrated into the column that would attack the rebels in Artillery 1 and the Rotunda. At around midday the cruisers Adamastor and SÃ£o Rafael, which had anchored in front of the sailors' quarters an hour previously, started the bombardment of the Palace of Necessidades, an action which served to demoralise the present monarchical forces. The king took refuge in a small house in the palace's park, where he could ring Teixeira de Sousa, since the revolutionaries had only cut the special state telephone lines and not the general network. The king ordered the prime minister to send the battery from Queluz to the palace to impede the debarkation of the sailors, but the prime minister replied that the main action was happening in Rotunda and all the troops that were there were needed. Taking into account that the available troops were not sufficient to defeat the rebels in Rotunda, the minister made it obvious to the king that it would be more convenient to retire to Sintra or Mafra so that the stationed forces of the palace could reinforce the troops in Rotunda.|$|E
