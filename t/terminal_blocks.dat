25|$|A typical {{central office}} may have tens of {{thousands}} of pairs of wires that appear on <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> called the main distribution frame (MDF). A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper. Before computerization of Bell System records in the 1980s, this information was handwritten in pencil in accounting ledger books.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, {{terminals}} {{can also}} be arranged as a terminal strip or <b>terminal</b> <b>block,</b> with several screws along (typically) two long strips. This creates a bus bar for power distribution, and so may also include a master input connector, usually binding posts or banana connectors.|$|R

50|$|One type of {{terminal}} block accepts wires that are prepared only by removing (stripping) a short length of insulation from the end. Another type accepts wires that have ring or spade terminal lugs crimped onto the wires. Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> allow individual wires {{to be connected}} to the circuit board. PCB mounted <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are soldered to the board, but they are available in a pull-apart version that allows the wire-connecting half of the block to be unplugged from the part that is soldered to the PCB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> (also called {{terminal}} boards or strips) provide a convenient means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to connect wiring among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{control units}} are {{typically}} wall-mounted control panels {{and can be}} mounted in a NEMA enclosure. Control units vary by technology by using line and load <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> relays, activation terminals, transformers, as well as monitoring electronics.|$|E
50|$|In the {{automation}} industry, {{a terminal}} adapter is a passive device that converts a connector like the 8P8C (RJ-45) modular connector or 9 pin D-Sub into a <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> to facilitate wiring. It {{is often used}} when daisy-chain wiring is necessary on a multi-node serial communication network like RS-485 or RS-422.|$|R

50|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} components and devices sometimes have {{plug and socket}} connectors or <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> but individual screw terminals and fast-on or quick-disconnect terminals are more common. Small components have bare lead wires for soldering. They are manufactured using casting.|$|E
50|$|Twist-on wire {{connectors}} are commonly color-coded {{to indicate the}} connector size and, hence, their capacity. They are commonly used {{as an alternative to}} <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> or the soldering of conductors together, since they are quicker to install and, unlike soldered connections, allow easy subsequent removal for future modifications.|$|E
50|$|In telecom {{applications}} like punch-down <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> {{and cell}} phone repair, the spudger {{is made of}} a non-conductive material to prevent transmission of a static shock or direct short to sensitive electrical components' inputs or outputs. This is critical with high density applications where uninsulated terminals are in close proximity, like a battery or with telephone patch junctions.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, Begumpet was the 6th busiest airport in India. It had 13 parking bays in {{operation}} around the <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> and five [...] "night parking bays" [...] on the Northern side, next to the old block, sufficient to handle the A 320 and Boeing 737. The airport had limited night landing facilities and only 30% of Andhra Pradesh's international traffic flowed through the airport, due to lack of direct flights.|$|R
5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank {{communication}} devices. The plan was to equip each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander's tank would be equipped with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in the platoon, one for communication with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|R
50|$|The actual icky-pick {{compound}} is a {{very thick}} petroleum-based substance with very high flammability, and consequently is only rated for outdoor use, frequently direct-buried in the ground. An outdoor cable spliced onto an indoor <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> is prone to leak the gelatin which is a fire hazard, hence in many situations the icky-pic cable is spliced (usually outside the building) to a short run of normal cable which is run in a protective conduit into the building and then terminated. The thick gelatin stains clothing and hands and {{is very difficult to}} remove.|$|R
50|$|It is {{most often}} used to prevent rust, but is also {{commonly}} applied {{to the ends of}} stranded wire used as electrical conductors to prevent oxidation (which increases electrical resistance), and to keep them from fraying or unraveling when used in various wire connectors like twist-ons, binding posts, or <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> where stray strands can cause a short circuit.|$|E
50|$|Electrical design: The {{electrical}} design module allows now {{to generate}} cable conduits for special non-standard cross-section cableways and to define conduits with cables inside cable trays, considering {{them in the}} cross-section filling calculations. In the cable routing the definition of cable splitting has also been improved and the management of cables partially routed has a better functionality in the connection between cables and <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{broadcast}} engineering, {{a distribution}} frame is a location within an apparatus room through which all signals (audio, video, or data) pass, {{with the ability}} to arbitrarily route and connect sources and destinations between studios and other internal and external points. Connections can either be soldered, or made using <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks.</b> Because the frame may carry live broadcast signals, it may be considered part of the airchain.|$|E
