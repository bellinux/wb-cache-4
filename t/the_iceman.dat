50|$|Drayton {{would face}} the Lucknow Lancers in a best of seven quarter final series, and <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> took a 1-0 series lead with very solid goaltending {{in the series}} opener, as Drayton won the game 2-1. <b>The</b> <b>Icemen</b> would drop <b>the</b> next game by a very close score of 3-2 as the series was evened up. The series moved to Drayton {{for the next two}} games, but it was Lucknow who won those games, taking a 3-1 series lead and putting <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> on <b>the</b> brink of elimination. Lucknow would finish the series in the fifth game, {{shutting}} out Drayton 10-0, eliminating <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> from <b>the</b> playoffs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Icemen</b> {{would face}} <b>the</b> Durham Thundercats in the [...] "A" [...] quarter-finals, and {{would lose the}} series opener in heartbreaking fashion, as Durham {{defeated}} Drayton 7-6 in double overtime. Durham handled <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> easily in <b>the</b> second game, winning 6-2, followed by a blowout victory in the third game, defeating Drayton 8-2. <b>The</b> <b>Icemen</b> would go quietly in the fourth game, as the Thundercats crushed Drayton by a score of 9-3, completing the series sweep.|$|R
50|$|On April 20, 2015, it was {{announced}} that the team had changed its name to <b>the</b> Tahoe <b>Icemen.</b> On May 4, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> announced <b>the</b> hiring of Tom Maroste as head coach and general manager for the 2015-16 season. After one season, in which <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> won only two games, Maroste was replaced by former professional hockey player Mickey Lang.|$|R
5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi <b>the</b> <b>Iceman,</b> a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that may have been}} used as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi <b>the</b> <b>Iceman,</b> a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E
5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{has been}} practiced {{all over the}} world since ancient times. There is considerable written and archaeological evidence of the practice. Mummified bodies with pierced ears have been discovered, including the oldest mummified body discovered to date, the 5,300-year-old Ötzi <b>the</b> <b>Iceman,</b> which was found in a glacier in Italy. This mummy had an ear piercing 7–11mm diameter. The oldest earrings found in a grave date to 2500 BCE. These were located in the Sumerian city of Ur, home of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. Earrings are mentioned in the Bible. In Genesis 35:4, Jacob buries the earrings worn by members of his household along with their idols. In Exodus 32, Aaron makes the golden calf from melted earrings. Deuteronomy 15:12–17 dictates ear piercing for a slave who chooses not to be freed. Earrings are also referenced in connection to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in the Vedas. Earrings for pierced ears were found in a grave in the Ukok region between Russia and China dated between 400 and 300 BCE.|$|E
50|$|WOAA Sr. Hockey {{came back}} to Drayton for the 2005-06 season, as they were awarded an {{expansion}} team, which was named <b>the</b> <b>Icemen.</b> In 25 games, <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> finished in last place in the 18 team league, with a 1-24-0 record. They scored 60 goals, and allowed 223. Drayton then played the Mildmay Monarchs in a best of three qualifying round, with the winner going {{to participate in the}} WOAA playoffs, however <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> were eliminated in two games, thus ending their season.|$|R

5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi <b>the</b> <b>Iceman</b> was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 World Cup champions were {{coached by}} Sir Brian Lochore who had {{represented}} New Zealand in 25 tests between 1964 and 1971, including 17 as captain. He was knighted in 1999 for his lifetime services to rugby. Four of the 1987 World Cup squad {{that he had}} coached are also inductees in the Hall of Fame. Sir John Kirwan played a total of 63 tests between 1984 and 1994, scoring 35 tries, an All Blacks record at the time. In the 1987 World Cup opener against Italy, Kirwan raced 90 meters to score one of the tries of the tournament. An All Black from 1984 to 1993, Grant Fox was one of New Zealand's greatest point-scorers with 1067 points, including 645 test points. Fox played 46 tests, including the 1987 World Cup final against France. Known as <b>The</b> <b>Iceman,</b> Michael Jones {{was one of the}} greatest open side flankers of all time. Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Jones first played international rugby for Samoa, then for New Zealand, playing 55 tests between 1987 and 1998. Due to his Christian faith, Jones never played rugby on Sundays, resulting in him not playing in the 1991 World Cup semi-final against Australia, and also in him not being picked for the 1995 World Cup squad. The team's captain, David Kirk, was inducted into the World Rugby Hall alongside Lochore; all other World Cup-winning captains through 2007 (minus the already-inducted Australian John Eales) were also enshrined at this ceremony.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Helmut Simon died. Two years later, in June 2006, {{an appeals}} court affirmed that the Simons had indeed {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>Iceman</b> and were therefore entitled to a finder's fee. It also ruled that the provincial government had to pay the Simons' legal costs. After this ruling, Mrs. Erika Simon reduced her claim to €150,000. The provincial government's response was that the expenses it had incurred to establish a museum {{and the costs of}} preserving <b>the</b> <b>Iceman</b> should be considered in determining the finder's fee. It insisted it would pay no more than €50,000. In September 2006, the authorities appealed the case to Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Icemen</b> had a {{bit more}} success in their second season, {{finishing}} with a 4-19-1 record, good for eighth place in the North Division, and sixteenth overall in <b>the</b> WOAA. <b>The</b> <b>Icemen</b> would then face the Georgian Bay River Rats in a best of three qualifying round, and the team won their first ever playoff series by sweeping the River Rats.|$|R

25|$|External frame packs were {{designed}} to carry heavy loads (>20kg or 40lb), giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple, frameless strapped bag. Wooden pack frames were used for centuries around the world. Ötzi <b>the</b> <b>Iceman</b> may have used one in Copper Age Alpine Italy, though some archaeologists believe the frame found with the body {{was part of a}} snowshoe. Such packs are common in military and mountaineering applications; metal versions first appeared in the mid-20th century.|$|E

In another close game, <b>the</b> <b>Icemen</b> and Crushers were tied at the end of regulation time, sending the game into a sudden death overtime.

25|$|Traces of the Copper Age (Chalcolithic era) in Austria were {{identified}} in the Carpathian Basin hoard at Stollhof, Hohe Wand, Lower Austria. Hilltop settlements from this era are common in eastern Austria. During this time the inhabitants sought out and developed raw materials in the central Alpine areas. The most important find {{is considered to be}} <b>the</b> <b>Iceman</b> Ötzi a well-preserved mummy of a man frozen in the Alps dating from approximately 3,300 BC, although these finds are now in Italy on the Austrian border. Another culture is the Mondsee culture, represented by stilt houses in the Alpine lakes.|$|E
25|$|Recent DNA {{analyses}} {{claim they}} revealed traces of blood {{from at least}} four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from the same arrowhead, and a fourth from his coat. Interpretations of these findings were that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow, {{and was able to}} retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back. Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a theory that before death occurred and rigor mortis set in, <b>the</b> <b>Iceman</b> was turned onto his stomach in the effort to remove the arrow shaft.|$|E
25|$|During the 1977–78 season, George Gervin and David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets battled {{all season}} for the NBA scoring title.

That night Gervin knew that he needed 58 points against the Jazz in New Orleans. Gervin got off to a good start by scoring 20 points in the 1st quarter. In the 2nd, <b>The</b> <b>Iceman</b> was even better, setting a single period record with 33 points. Early on in the 3rd period Gervin scored his 58 points on the way to 63 capturing the scoring title.
