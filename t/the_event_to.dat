5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} <b>the</b> <b>event.</b> <b>To</b> put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E

5|$|For many years, revellers {{celebrating the}} New Year have {{gathered}} in the square {{despite a lack of}} celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity Unicef, who began ticketing <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>to</b> control crowd numbers.|$|E

Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada also activated their CDERA response systems. Although they were not directly affected by the hurricane they used the opportunity to test the systems' operating procedures.
