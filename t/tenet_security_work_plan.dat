40|$|This article reports {{findings}} from {{a survey of}} 385 supported employment provider agencies on their use of two Social <b>Security</b> <b>Work</b> Incentives, the <b>Plan</b> for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) and Impairment-Related Work Expenses (IRWE). Results indicated that PASSes and IRWEs are used by supported employment consumers at rates far above that of the SSA beneficiary population. PASS and IRWE approval rates were reported to be high, and respondents generally reported few problems in accessing these supports. Set-aside funds were predominantly used to purchase transportation, supported employment services, work equipment and supplies, and other needed supports and services. Findings are discussed in light of reports by the U. S. General Accounting Office that have found mismanagement and misuse of SSA Work Incentives. Perhaps the most tangible and imposing barrier to employment for persons with disabilities is potential loss of income assistance and health care through programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Health Care Financing Administration. As Bowe (1993) notes, the two major disability-related programs operated by SSA, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Disability Insurance (DI), are "dependence-oriented.

40|$|Summary The {{subject of}} this study is the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> (schemes of <b>work)</b> in school. A <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> is a {{document}} that describes assignment the students are expected to do during a particular period of time. It can be used to solve didactical challenges connected to pedagogic differentiation and self- regulated learning. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is not developed as a consequence of departmental directives, but a tool made on a local level. Recent classroom research (Klette et al 2008, Haug 2009) shows {{that one of the most}} visible trends is that the amount of individual work is increasing at the expense of the collective teaching, and the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> is a part of this picture. The use of <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> has been criticized because it leads to the ‘classroom’ as a learning arena becoming less important and the teacher adopting a background role. As a result, the student must take more responsibility for their own learning, and this leads to different outcomes for the students (Klette 2007). This study has three main areas of discussion: How widespread is the use <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in school? Which activities and types of interaction have teacher and student when the <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as a learning tool? What are the teacher’s intentions in their use of <b>work</b> <b>plans?</b> Data in this study are collected from a survey to teachers and quantitative classroom observations at levels 3, 6, and 9, which are based upon the research project, Quality in Education (KIO) at Volda University Collage. Collection of data took place in 2007 - 2008. The main findings in this present research are that <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used at all levels at Primary School level, but the KIO data identifies variations with regards to the design and application of these <b>planning</b> documents. Most <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> in use are common <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> for several subjects. These plans are used to a limited extent in schools at levels 3 through to 6, but increasing by year 9. By year 9 the students follow the <b>work</b> <b>plan</b> for a third of the time of their individual work. Teachers both justify and define the schemes of work principally as a means of informing students and parents about school work and homework in an agreed period of time. It may appear that the teachers have no holistic teaching methodology behind the use of <b>work</b> <b>plans.</b> The teacher’s main educational reasons for using <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are pedagogic differentiation. At level 9 <b>work</b> <b>plans</b> are used as the main tool when the student is working with differential tasks, whilst year 6 students rarely work with differential tasks when they are using a <b>work</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{sequential}} qualitative-quantitative study investigates reported {{levels of}} task interdependence by certified information security professionals from organizations worldwide. The empirical tests show that information security ranked high in task interdependence {{compared to other}} information system related tasks. Additionally, comparing results from a different survey, information <b>security</b> <b>work</b> demonstrates higher levels of reported task interdependence than telecommunications software development work. We present {{the results of a}} demographic analysis of the survey taken by 936 certified information security professionals. Overall, the results suggest that information <b>security</b> <b>work</b> in organizations requires high levels of task interdependence. These findings have implications for researchers by identifying task interdependencerelated topics for future study. For practitioners, these findings provide relevant insight into the nature of information <b>security</b> <b>work</b> in organizations...|$|R
