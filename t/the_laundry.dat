5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly <b>the</b> <b>Laundry</b> End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though the floors were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road. The East Stand is considered architecturally significant enough to have been designated a Grade II listed building.|$|E
50|$|Since 2001, the Irish {{government}} {{has acknowledged that}} women in <b>the</b> Magdalene <b>laundries</b> were victims of abuse. However, the Irish {{government has}} resisted calls for investigation and proposals for compensation; it maintains <b>the</b> <b>laundries</b> were privately run and abuses at <b>the</b> <b>laundries</b> are outside <b>the</b> government's remit. In contrast to these claims, evidence exists that Irish courts routinely sent women convicted of petty crimes to <b>the</b> <b>laundries,</b> <b>the</b> government awarded lucrative contracts to <b>the</b> <b>laundries</b> without any insistence on protection and fair treatment of their workers, and Irish state employees helped keep laundry facilities stocked with workers by bringing women to work there and returning escaped workers.|$|R
5000|$|Eclipsed, a {{play about}} <b>the</b> Magdalene <b>Laundries,</b> was written by Patricia Burke-Brogan in the 1980s. Burke-Brogan had worked in <b>the</b> <b>laundries</b> in <b>the</b> 1960s. Eclipsed was first {{performed}} in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Following {{publication}} in 2012 {{of the report}} of then Independent Senator Martin McAleese into <b>the</b> Magdalene <b>Laundries,</b> which Shatter commissioned, he established with government agreement a financial scheme to compensate the survivors of <b>the</b> <b>laundries</b> and other supportive measures. A state apology for the survivors ill treatment was also made by the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny. The plight of the survivors of <b>the</b> <b>laundries</b> had been ignored for decades and there was widespread welcome for the government action taken.|$|R
5|$|In 1908, Charles F. Brown, {{who entered}} <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> {{business}} in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building, and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat wash water, and {{the main part of}} the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines. The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale Laundry, one of the larger laundries, employed 125 people, many of whom were women.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} of the two-story 306ft long {{building}} contained a clothing factory, dry cleaning plant, furniture plant, brush factory, and an office, where prisoners of the federal penitentiary could work for money. They earned a small wage for their labour which was put into an account, known as a Prisoner's Trust Fund, which would be given to them upon leaving Alcatraz. They made items such as gloves, furniture mats, and army uniforms. <b>The</b> <b>laundry</b> room occupied the entire upper floor, the largest in San Francisco at the time. Each window has 9 panes and there are 17 bays on each floor on either side.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{felt he had}} no choice, but his {{assumption}} of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, the commander of I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a {{lack of confidence in}} him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, after a series of disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier Arnold Potts of the 21st Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey. Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled Chester Wilmot's accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.|$|E
50|$|In Ireland {{they had}} two houses at Dublin. The Sisters of Charity of Our Lady of Refuge {{was one of four}} congregations {{involved}} in managing <b>the</b> controversial Magdalene <b>laundries.</b> Dr. Martin McAleese, found the environment in <b>the</b> <b>laundries</b> was harsh and involved physically demanding work, which produced a traumatic and lasting impact on the girls. However, the ill treatment and physical punishment present in industrial schools was not reported in <b>the</b> <b>laundries,</b> according to <b>the</b> vast majority of women.|$|R

5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> at Frank's house.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E

25|$|The club's colors {{at first}} were not cream. They {{started out with}} a white kit which had the badge on the chest. During one of their early seasons, Universitario could not {{participate}} in an upcoming match because their uniforms had been sent to <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> to be washed. The managers pleaded that they hurry with <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> and they quickly washed them. However, when the club received the jerseys, they found that they were no longer white, but yellow. <b>The</b> <b>laundry</b> workers had forgotten to remove the badges from the jerseys and consequently the red color from the badges mixed with the white jerseys giving it a yellow tint. The club {{had no choice but to}} use the jersey to play. They managed to win that game and a few others as well and thus the club kept the new-colored kit as a good-luck charm.|$|E
