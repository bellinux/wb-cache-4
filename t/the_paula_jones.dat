25|$|Coulter {{first became}} {{a public figure}} shortly before {{becoming}} an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway {{had been asked to}} assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case for Human Events, was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case, Lewinsky had {{submitted}} {{an affidavit}} that denied any physical relationship with Clinton. In January 1998, {{she attempted to}} persuade Tripp to commit perjury in the Jones case. Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who was investigating the Whitewater controversy and other matters. Starr was now armed with evidence of Lewinsky's admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, and he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible perjury in the Jones case.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{deposition}} for <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> lawsuit, Clinton denied having [...] "sexual relations" [...] with Monica Lewinsky. On {{the basis}} of the evidence provided by Monica Lewinsky, a blue dress with Clinton's semen, Ken Starr concluded that this sworn testimony was false and perjurious.|$|E
50|$|Bugliosi {{criticized the}} U.S. Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Clinton v. Jones. In his book, No Island of Sanity, {{he argues that}} the right of a president to be unburdened by a private lawsuit outweighed <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones's</b> interest in having her case brought to trial immediately.|$|R
25|$|Born in New York City to a {{conservative}} family, Coulter {{was raised in}} New Canaan, Connecticut. She deepened her conservative interests while studying history at Cornell University, where she helped found The Cornell Review. She subsequently embarked on {{a career as a}} law clerk before rising to prominence in the 1990s as an outspoken critic of the Clinton administration. Her first book concerned the Bill Clinton impeachment, and sprang from her experience writing legal briefs for <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones's</b> attorneys, as well as columns she wrote about the cases.|$|R
5|$|While the House Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} {{ended in}} a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but {{with a handful of}} Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones's</b> sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.|$|R

2500|$|After the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was {{the first}} lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation. During debate on the {{impeachment}} resolution on the House floor, Barr argued that Clinton's attempt to interfere with Lewinsky's testimony in <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case endangered the Constitution. In doing so, Barr said, Clinton violated what Barr called a [...] "fundamental right" [...] of any American citizen – [...] "the unshakable right {{each one of us}} has to walk into a courtroom and demand the righting of a wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewinsky {{confided in}} [...] Linda Tripp about her {{relationship}} with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress. Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them, which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{and bring them to}} the attention of people working on <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case. In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1997, <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones’s</b> private {{investigators}} {{tried to talk to}} Broaddrick at her home, also secretly taping the conversation. Broaddrick refused to discuss the incident, saying “it was just a horrible horrible thing,” and that she “wouldn’t relive it for anything.” The investigators told her she would likely be subpoenaed if she would not talk to them. Broaddrick said she would deny everything, saying “you can’t get to him, and I’m not going to ruin my good name to do it… there’s just absolutely no way anyone can get to him, he’s just too vicious.” Broaddrick was subpoenaed in the Jones suit soon after and submitted an affidavit denying that Clinton had made “any sexual advances”. The recording of Broaddrick’s conversation with the investigators was leaked to the press, but Broaddrick continued to refuse to speak to reporters.|$|R

2500|$|In January 1998, Tripp {{discovered}} that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case, denying {{a relationship with}} Clinton. She delivered tapes to Kenneth Starr, the Independent Counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater scandal, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued, [...] "It {{depends on what the}} meaning of the word 'is' is," [...] with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that [...] "there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lewinsky scandal was an American {{political}} {{sex scandal}} that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The sexual relationship {{took place between}} 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech {{with the statement that}} he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky. [...] Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{had also}} said, [...] "there {{is not a}} sexual relationship, an {{improper}} sexual relationship or {{any other kind of}} improper relationship" [...] which he defended as truthful on August 17, 1998 because of his use of the present tense, famously arguing [...] "it depends on what {{the meaning of the word}} 'is' is" [...] (i.e., he was not, at the time he made that statement, still in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky). Under pressure from Starr, who had obtained from Lewinsky a blue dress with Clinton's semen stain, as well as testimony from Lewinsky that the President had inserted a cigar tube into her vagina, Clinton stated, [...] "I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate." [...] Clinton denied having committed perjury because, according to Clinton, the legal definition of oral sex was not encompassed by [...] "sex" [...] per se. In addition, relying upon the definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] as proposed by the prosecution and agreed by the defense and by Judge Susan Webber Wright, who was hearing <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case, Clinton claimed that because certain acts were performed on him, not by him, he did not engage in sexual relations. Lewinsky's testimony to the Starr Commission, however, contradicted Clinton's claim of being totally passive in their encounters.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E
