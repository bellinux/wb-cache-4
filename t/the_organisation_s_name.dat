The establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) was the latest organisational innovation aimed at bridging the disjuncture between EU external relations and foreign policy structures. Almost immediately after its creation, it attracted wide-spread criticism of its functioning by the very same actors who had created it. This thesis develops a three-stage bureaucratic-institutionalist framework in order to explore the political contestation of this new organisation {{and its impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> and functioning of the EEAS. Inception, establishment and consolidation are the three phases of <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> life cycle under scrutiny. The thesis begins with the inception of the EEAS during the Convention on the Future of Europe from 2002 - 2003. Through the lens of rational choice historical institutionalism it analyses the positions of various actors in the Convention and the options that were considered during this phase. It then shows how disagreements between integrationist and more sceptical groups led to a vague compromise on the EEAS and its organisational design. The thesis continues with an analysis of the establishment phase, i. e. the negotiation process leading to the EEAS decision of 2010, throughout which the political conflict continued between the EU institutions on central design elements of the service such as status, scope and staffing. Theoretically, this conflict is captured through the politics of Eurocratic structure approach. In the final consolidation phase, the EEAS started to operate as a new administrative actor, but was heavily influenced by political and bureaucratic contestation. Bureaucracy theory helps to predict the organisational behaviour of the EEAS to a degree, but the thesis shows how <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> was also shaped by bureaucratic politics between EU institutions and member states. The thesis concludes that a bureaucratic-institutionalist approach explains why the EEAS is a strongly contested bureaucracy and how the processes of contestation at the EU level hindered institutional design throughout <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> life cycle of inception, establishment and consolidation. It reveals limitations of this approach, such as the persistence of actors, the weight of decision precedent and the permeability of organisational development phases...|$|R

Accordingly, the governance mechanisms over <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> IT resources must be in place and operating effectively if the organization is to achieve its objectives. The concern with IT governance is not only evident in the private sector but also in the public sector. This study attempts to examine empirically the individual IT governance mechanisms that influence the overall effectiveness of IT governance in Australian public sector organisations. Using sample data from auditors who currently work in Australian public sector organisations, this study examined the influence of four proposed individual IT governance mechanisms on the overall effectiveness of IT governance. This study found significant positive relationships between the existence of an IT strategy committee and corporate (organisational) communication systems, and the overall level of effective IT governance within Australian public sector organisations...|$|R

Over {{the last few years}} the ASA determined KM as a priority to assist with reducing knowledge loss, realising information assets and reducing work duplication by attempting to implement IKM tools and strategies. This research employed a pragmatic viewpoint, using a mix of both quantitative and qualitative methods to check reliability, to ensure validity while undertaking the task of implementing the IKM tools. Using a case study strategy and action research was justified, as to be pragmatic the researcher needed to understand the extent of the problem within a specified context. The research discussed in this thesis, provides a new framework for implementing KM tools; focusing on the NSO category, which <b>the</b> case study <b>organisation</b> falls into. <b>The</b> literature agrees enlisting influential members onto the project is vital for success; however, the findings suggested that success was not only tied to this buy-in alone, but also to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> ability to retain these members {{for the duration of the}} project. The research proposed the use of a newly developed tool within the new framework, as an approach to reduce the time it takes to undertake traditional social network analysis of <b>the</b> <b>organisation,</b> as it became clear that there was a need for a method of producing updated results of the SNA, which would span the length of long projects within organisations with significantly high staff turn-over rates. Privacy was given as a factor to consider the in literature; however, the findings from this study indicated that a majority of the participants were comfortable with the system. Email knowledge extraction, and email social network systems are not new concepts, however this research presents EKESNA; a novel tool that combines both concepts in a way that allows for the continuous discovery, visualisation, and analysis of knowledge networks around specified topics of interest within an organisation; linking conversations to specific expert knowledge. EKESNA s continuous discovery of <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> knowledge network affords members up-to-date data to inform business process reengineering.

40|$|How can {{public sector}} service {{providers}} deliver improved services to citizens within environments where inefficient and often corrupt service delivery is the norm? The following paper provides some {{answers to this}} question through examining {{the impact of a}} series of customer-focused service delivery reforms undertaken at the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (Metro Water) in Hyderabad City, Andhra Pradesh state, Southern India {{at the end of the}} 1990 s. The Metro Water case is interesting, as it shows how a semi-autonomous service provider can undertake organisational change and realise sustained improvements in service delivery performance. If this process is deepened over time there is a greater opportunity to attract, and provide security for, larger state or private sector investments that can impact water supply and sewerage service delivery over the long-term. This is the scenario that emerges in the following case. A key finding in this research is that multiple accountability relationships, operating between external actors and Metro Water staff, have collectively contributed to sustained organisational change and improved service delivery performance. The most critical of these relationships are those that triangulate between citizens, senior managers, and front-line workers. In the Metro Water case active citizen engagement through formal accountability mechanisms has been the key to <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> overall success in delivering improved services to citizens (both middle class and urban poor) throughout Hyderabad City...|$|R

The research study conducted aims to provide insight on the relationship between Information Communication Technology (ICT) and innovation on healthcare performance in South Africa. The researcher attempts to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by : (1) Investigating whether communication within ICTs promotes innovation and whether this innovation in turn is significant to improving healthcare in South Africa; (2) developing a tenable multi-dimensional framework that can be utilised by healthcare providers to implement and align with <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> strategy; and (3) providing specific recommendations for future researchers to improve management focus. The study aims to make a significant contribution by providing healthcare organisations with a framework that is a useful resource to their management, to address the gaps in healthcare innovation and ultimately assist in achieving the National Development Plan (NDP) 2030 vision of providing sustainable quality healthcare to all South African citizens at an affordable rate. The researcher adopted a mixed methodology to triangulate and interpret the subject matter more accurately. 35 Hospital Managers were surveyed and 15 Senior Executive Managers were interviewed from a large private South African Hospital Group to provide insight into the adoption of ICTs in healthcare <b>organisations.</b> <b>The</b> researcher finds that communication within ICTs drives innovation and in turn is significant to improving healthcare in South Africa. If well executed, communication shall drive innovation which shall allow healthcare <b>organisations</b> <b>the</b> ability to maximise opportunities by improving their value propositions with an enhanced quality of care while rationalising cost. The performance of healthcare organisations is dependent on leadership competencies and a culture of innovation that has the ability to overcome the barriers of adoption and the ability to deal with change.

The data is based on questionnaire responses from national governments, covering the years 2008 and 2009. Twenty-seven of <b>the</b> <b>Organisation.</b> <b>s</b> 34 member countries have contributed to date. Employment in SOEs across the OECD area exceeds 6 million people, and that the value of all SOEs combined is close to US$ 2 trillion. In addition to this, the State in many countries holds minority stakes in listed enterprises that are large enough to confer effective control. These enterprises employ a further 3 million people and are valued at close to US$ 1 trillion. Hence, while state ownership of enterprises has declined in recent decades, SOEs and similar entities continue to account for {{a significant part of the}} corporate economy in many countries. Following decades of privatisation, the remaining SOEs have a strong sectoral concentration. Around half (in value terms) of all SOEs in OECD countries are located in the network sectors, mostly transportation, power generation and other energy. A further fourth of total valuation is accounted for by financial institutions. In addition, among the partly state-owned listed companies there are many partly privatised telecommunications companies. In other words, not only do state-invested enterprises remain significant, they are also increasingly concentrated in a few ¡°strategic¡± sectors of great importance to the competitiveness of the rest of the business sector. privatisation, state-owned enterprises, corporate governance...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{definition}} for this master thesis is formulated {{in collaboration with}} Hydro representatives, and is related to Hydro s CROC project. The thesis aims to critically review Hydro <b>s</b> R&D <b>organisation,</b> and reveal factors which hinder synergies from being realised, and innovation to take place. A proposal for improvement has also been prepared. A broad literature study on the topic Radical innovation in mature <b>organisations</b> provides <b>the</b> theoretical foundation for the perspective of this master thesis. The study focuses {{on the problems of}} large and mature organisations in promoting and responding to radical innovation in their industries. The concepts of Dynamic Capabilities and Absorptive Capacity are particularly focused upon, and the study emphasises resource-based theories for strategy with an inside-out perspective. Four case studies have been carried out in Hydro s mid- and downstream R&D organisation. Empirical data has been collected through interviews and meetings; six interviewees in Hydro s R&D management have provided rich data for analysis. Main themes include cross-sectional cooperation, innovation challenges, cultural differences and structural assets within <b>the</b> R&D <b>organisation.</b> Hydro <b>s</b> R&D <b>organisation</b> employs a polycentric, decentralised model, and is characterised by high centre autonomy and unrealised synergies. The organisational structure bears evidence of a history of acquisitions. Building Systems R&D department and Upstream R&D are omitted from <b>the</b> central R&D <b>organisation</b> for no evident reason. <b>The</b> remaining R&D <b>organisation</b> serves all of Hydro s business areas, however, mid- and downstream R&D is line organised under one single business sector. This leads to problems at top level, as the head of R&D reports to the representative of one business sector, although personally representing an <b>organisation</b> which serves <b>the</b> entire value chain. The R&D centres are tightly connected to their internal clients, which operate within distinct business sectors. The clients have strategic power as a result of financial power over R&D, and are free to define projects as they wish. There are few multisite R&D projects, and in all, little collaboration between the centres. Competence overlap is evident between some sites. Silo mentality is present at all sites, and is evident both between and within the R&D centres. There is little common culture and identity marking <b>the</b> R&D <b>organisation,</b> and this complicates internal collaboration. Limited internal collaboration leads to a weak social capital, in turn making <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> less flexible when faced with the challenges represented by a radical change in the environment. Strong customer dedication along with strict key performance indicators and reward systems, leads to short term focus. Routines for Technology Watch are absent; technology watch happens sporadically and randomly. The strategic focus on Step Change (radical) innovation in Hydro is not translated into practice in <b>the</b> <b>organisation.</b> Processes for facilitating innovation projects are lacking, and although the New Ideas programme functions relatively well, {{there is a lack of}} follow-up on the New Ideas projects. <b>The</b> <b>organisation</b> relies heavily on individuals initiative to promote innovation. My proposal involves three main changes, which are listed below. 1. Gathering of all R&D activities in one central R&D <b>organisation.</b> <b>The</b> head of <b>the</b> R&D <b>organisation</b> should report directly to the Group Chief Executive and be seated in corporate management. 2. Financial empowerment of <b>the</b> R&D <b>organisation.</b> More projects should be financed by <b>the</b> central R&D <b>organisation,</b> allowing a more long-term approach and focus on step change projects. 3. Establishment of a hub for innovation; responsible for taking care of Hydro s efforts to create step change. The hub is a transversal organisational entity, employing key people from every business sector and every R&D centre. If executed properly, these structural and formal changes may significantly enhance <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> internal social capital and rate of collaboration, as they provide a fresh foundation on which a uniform creative R&D culture and identity can be built. This will stimulate a realisation of latent synergies in <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> and improved R&D performance. A unifying and creative culture also makes the workforce more flexible and their behaviours more predictable, which positively affects the dynamic capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>organisation.</b> <b>The</b> hub takes on responsibility for technology watch and screening and selection of innovation projects, directly improving the absorptive capacity and innovation processes in Hydro <b>s</b> R&D <b>organisation.</b> Combined with a creative culture, this makes <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> more prone to promoting step change innovation. The proposed changes may help direct Hydro <b>s</b> R&D <b>organisation</b> towards <b>the</b> integrated R&D network model...|$|R

The Closed Access version of this thesis cannot be accessed. The Open Access version of this thesis has had Appendices J, K and L removed for confidentiality reasons. This study is motivated by the growing influence in organisational research on the perspective of culture as a toolkit of resources from which individuals can draw on to develop strategies of action. Research has established that ambidextrous organisations succeed both in incremental and discontinuous innovation. However, there remains a scarcity of study on how managers orchestrate ambidexterity. This thesis extends the ambidexterity research by investigating how managers orchestrate ambidextrous strategies and how these strategies are shaped by elements of the organisational culture in high technology firms. An interpretive case study approach was used to achieve {{the aims of the}} study. Focusing on two engineering projects, 55 interviews were conducted alongside documentary reviews and participant observation for 6 months at Brush Electrical Machines Ltd, UK. Analysis of the findings is conducted using thematic analysis to identify common themes and NVivo was used to draw out patterns until relationships among the emerging themes became clearer. The thesis makes important contributions to the organisational ambidexterity literature by providing useful empirically-driven insights and deconstructing the roles of middle managers in facilitating ambidexterity. The findings of the research indicate that most of the middle managers demonstrated ambidextrous behaviours. These middle level managers enabled their behaviours through diverse cultural resources selected from <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> cultural toolkit. Thus, important contributions are made to the literature on organisational culture, specifically on the toolkit perspectives. The thesis takes the perspective that organisational culture should be viewed as heterogeneous and not homogeneous. The study concludes by suggesting that middle management ambidextrous behaviours shaped by cultural resources may be vital for the realisation of improved or sustained competitiveness in organisations...|$|R

Main outcome measures: The study used three validated instruments to measure ‘employee satisfaction with communication processes’, ‘job satisfaction’ and ‘affective commitment’ (which measures commitment to an organisation).

40|$|M. Comm. Persons often {{perceive}} effectiveness differently. Once {{the term}} effectiveness is used, {{every person in}} an audience would probably have {{a different point of}} view of what is meant by effectiveness. The aim of this study is to provide a survey to the personnel of MHS, to obtain a diverse audience that is familiar with <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> and through analysis to establish what is required to ensure the effectiveness of MHS as an organisation. An organisation's management will often identify that a problem exists within <b>the</b> <b>organisation.</b> They are however unable to diagnose exactly what the problem is and may even have much different perceptions of the management problem than employees working at the ground level. This study is meant to guide management decision making, by providing recommendations to resolve identified problems during transformation planning in <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> and before any changes are implemented. The study will assist in diagnosing the organisation's ability to adapt to the future. The model can also be applied to establish which of the links that exist between each of the S's can be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of <b>the</b> <b>organisation.</b> No <b>S</b> on it's own is a strength or a weakness; it is only relevant to the degree that it supports the other S's. Any of the S's that harmonise with all the other S's will be deemed strengths. Any dissonances are weaknesses (Enock, 2001 a: 3). The model will highlight how changes made in any one of the S's will have an impact on all the other S's. Therefore if planned change is to be effective, then changes in one S must be accompanied by complementary changes in the others (Enock, 2001 a: 3). The crux of the study lies therein that: "The 7 S framework provides a way of understanding how interrelated elements fit together in trying to implement a strategy. It is the degree of difference between what a firm does well and the requirements of a new strategy that determine the degree of difficulty of implementation" (Harvey, 1988 : 199).

And it must be said that it began rather badly! At the request of a German company, Edmond Mahuta and about 15 young people decided to start a business growing peppers in the Masi-Manimba region, 250 km east of Kinshasa. They harvested 30 sacks, each weighing 10 kg. Happily, they sent the first two parcels to Germany by post. Not a word! So they decided to sell their product on the local market, but there were no buyers there either. The group quickly became discouraged and broke up. Only Edmond and a friend called Gilbert remained, but they were determined to continue their struggle against unemployment and idleness, which befall many young rural dwellers in DRC. Gilbert stayed where he was while Edmond left for Bindungi, about 100 km further south, to grow peanuts on 2 ha of land. The teachers and some other young people from the village approached me and asked if we could do something together, he recalls. November 1995 saw the launch of the Association paysanne pour le développement social de Masi-Manimba (ASSOPADEM) community organisation, which Edmund coordinates to this day. This farmers NGO had a two-pronged goal to ensure the food security of communities living in the region and to find work for its young people. With a background in humanities, Edmond studied a correspondence course on farming and community development from the Institut africain de développement social (INADES) in Kinshasa over the next 4 years. Out in the field, the members of the association carried on, season after season, growing maize, cassava, peanuts, soya, cowpeas, etc., until in 2001, a priest called Franklin Munguba introduced them to Spore. The magazine changed our whole way of working the land, explains Edmond Mahuta, with some emotion. The women of Bindungi, who used to grow a few meagre okras, grew 4 ha of vegetables in 2004. It was all thanks to techniques learned in Spore, claims Edmond. Each issue is read and dissected in groups, under the guidance of the association s agronomist who, when necessary, offers explanations to the women, many of whom are illiterate.

A. is maintaining the aid to navigation of the main river in Argentina, a concession given by the national government of maintaining and dredging more than 1500 km of waterway. The aid to navigation can be divided in roughly three types: buoy, beacon and spar, which they mainly hold up by using corrective maintenance. This could positively be changed by adapting some maintenance strategies. Using a Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Mode Effect Analysis during the RCM process, a few things were noticed; the three types of Aid to Navigation (AtoN) have a lot different sub components in common, the buoy has the highest failure rate and within the buoy there are six critical sub components: the top mark, lantern, battery (case), solar panel, floating system and chain. These six critical sub components could gain more reliability by adapting the maintenance policy: scheduled maintenance of the lantern, battery case and solar panel, redesign of the floating system and a combined strategy (preventive and scheduled maintenance) for the chain. In order to give a real maintenance policy adaptation, unfortunately more information is needed. More research should be done in the possibility of combining the scheduled replacement with the preventive maintenance and the redesigned buoys replacement.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A re-sourcing decision is a sourcing decision subsequent to an outsourcing arrangement. Effective management of re-sourcing decisions is vital in ensuring the stability and continuity of organisational operations supported by outsourced critical activities. However, despite {{the importance of this}} stage in the outsourcing cycle, most outsourcing research has focused on outsourcing determinants and outsourcing process control stages. The study reported in this thesis set out to explore maintenance re-sourcing decisions in an asset-intensive service organisation operating in a capital constrained economy. The objectives of the study were to determine the factors that influence the management of maintenance re-sourcing decisions in asset intensive service organisations and to propose a management model for guiding maintenance re-sourcing decision making processes in such organisations. In order to achieve these objectives, a qualitative style oriented in-depth case study was adopted. Results from a thematic data analysis revealed that the management of re-sourcing decisions is impacted by factors that fall into three categories: <b>the</b> purchasing <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> structural elements, external structural elements and boundary spanning elements. However, of the three categories, boundary spanning elements were found to have a greater bearing on the effectiveness of the most critical stages, incumbent supplier performance evaluation and incumbent to alternative supplier comparison. In addition to the recognised role that outsourcing models play in guiding sourcing decisions, this study has revealed the importance of three more key enablers. These include: recruiting qualified and experienced individuals into boundary spanning roles, developing and maintaining enabling environments for boundary spanners to engage in behaviour that supports the purchaser s goals and values, and, developing information management systems targeted at enhancing regular capturing of incumbent and alternative supplier capability and capacity before re-sourcing decision time. The results from this study will primarily benefit sourcing managers in asset-intensive service organisations operating in capital constrained economies that have outsourced or intend to outsource maintenance...|$|R
5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise <b>the</b> <b>organisation</b> itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own <b>organisation,</b> <b>the</b> Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of <b>the</b> ordinary suffrage <b>organisation.</b> <b>The</b> W. <b>S.</b> P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} understand whether external social capital creation with external stakeholders {{was indeed a}} valid management tool that could contribute to increasing an <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> competitiveness under these circumstances. It also aimed to validate the Opportunity-Motivation-Ability (OMA) model {{for the creation of}} social capital in the Information and Communications Technology industry and to provide a framework to guide organisations in their endeavours to ensure optimal social capital creation. The necessary leadership qualities that are associated with social capital creation were also explored. This research adds to the current literature on social capital and organisational competitiveness. This research was conducted using a qualitative and explanatory research methodology and collected data through semi-structured interviews with eleven C-level executives across five ICT organisations. Key findings that contribute to the field of social capital and organisational competitiveness include factors such as informational transfer, influence on external stakeholders and differentiation as part of an <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> strategy. These are shown to contribute positively to an <b>organisation</b> <b>s</b> competitiveness. <b>The</b> OMA was confirmed as a valid model for the ICT industry and importantly all three elements of the model need to present for the benefits of social capital to be realised. Humility and integrity were overwhelmingly identified as being the key leadership qualities associated with social capital creation.

40|$|Abstract Background Saturated brines are extreme environments of low diversity. Salinibacter ruber is {{the only}} {{bacterium}} that inhabits this environment in significant numbers. In order to establish the extent of genetic diversity in natural populations of this microbe, the genomic sequence of reference strain DSM 13855 was compared to metagenomic fragments recovered from climax saltern crystallizers and obtained with 454 sequencing technology. This kind of analysis reveals the presence of metagenomic islands, i. e. highly variable regions among the different lineages in the population. Results Three regions of the sequenced isolate were scarcely represented in the metagenome thus appearing to vary among co-occurring S. ruber cells. These metagenomic islands showed evidence of extensive genomic corruption with atypically low GC content, low coding density, high numbers of pseudogenes and short hypothetical proteins. A detailed analysis of island gene content showed that the genes in metagenomic island 1 code for cell surface polysaccharides. The strain-specific genes of metagenomic island 2 {{were found to be}} involved in biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharide components. Finally, metagenomic island 3 was rich in DNA related enzymes. Conclusion <b>The</b> genomic <b>organisation</b> of <b>S.</b> ruber variable genomic regions showed a number of convergences with genomic islands of marine microbes studied, being largely involved in variable cell surface traits. This variation at the level of cell envelopes in an environment devoid of grazing pressure probably reflects a global strategy of bacteria to escape phage predation. </p...|$|R
