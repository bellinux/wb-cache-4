40|$|ABSTRACT. In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relative}} performance of three commonly used procurement mechanisms: price-only auctions, scoring auctions, and benchmarking. We do so both in theory and in a laboratory experiment. We find that <b>the</b> <b>auctions</b> yield <b>the</b> same level of welfare, and welfare dominate benchmarking. In theory, the “pie ” is shared the same in both auctions between buyer and suppliers, and both the buyer and suppliers obtain higher utility than in benchmarking. In contrast, in our experiment, we observe that <b>the</b> price-only <b>auction</b> generates higher supplier utility than <b>the</b> scoring <b>auction,</b> while <b>the</b> scoring <b>auction</b> dominates <b>the</b> price-only <b>auction</b> in terms of expected profit for the buyer. We do find support for the underperformance of benchmarking versus <b>the</b> <b>auctions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling {{to take a chance}} on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b>|$|E
