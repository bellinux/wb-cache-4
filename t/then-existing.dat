5|$|In 2005, Newsom {{pushed for}} a state law to allow {{communities}} in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to <b>then-existing</b> California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.|$|E
5|$|St Mihangel's Church in {{the village}} of Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn is a former parish church now used as the chapel for RAF Valley in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of the first church on the site is uncertain, but in 1862 the <b>then-existing</b> church was rebuilt. St Mihangel's became the chapel for the nearby Royal Air Force base in 1998, after the Church in Wales had ceased using it for services. It was then {{extended}} by dismantling and reassembling another Anglesey church, St Enghenedl's, at the west end of the building.|$|E
5|$|This was a fast-spreading rift; the {{resulting}} basalts show little {{interaction with the}} <b>then-existing</b> rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, {{one can see the}} solidified lava (igneous rock) most everywhere. In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than basalt). These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.|$|E
5|$|During 1963, the M-102 {{designation}} {{was extended}} northerly along Jefferson Avenue through St. Clair Shores, replacing the M-29 designation to the Shook Road interchange {{at the northern}} end of the <b>then-existing</b> I-94 freeway. That extension was reversed the next year, and M-102 was scaled back to end at US25 (Gratiot Avenue); the rest of 8Mile and Vernier roads plus the Jefferson Avenue segment are added to M-29 instead. M-102 was re-extended along 8Mile and Vernier roads to the I-94 interchange in Harper Woods in 1970 replacing M-29; the remainder of that other highway along Vernier Road and Jefferson Avenue to Shook Road that was once part of M-102 was transferred to local control.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{decommissioned}} battleships {{were removed}} from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) after it was determined by ranking US Navy officials that there was no place for a battleship in the modern navy. In response to the striking of the battleships from the Naval Vessel Register a movement began to reinstate the battleships, on the grounds that these vessels had superior firepower over the <b>then-existing</b> 5-inch guns found on the , , and s, and s. Citing concern over the lack of available gunfire to support amphibious operations, Congress demanded that the United States Navy reinstate two battleships to the naval vessel register and maintain them with the mothball fleet, until the Navy could certify it had gunfire support within the current fleet that would meet or exceed the battleship's capability.|$|E
25|$|Some of the <b>then-existing</b> local {{tracks in}} 1980 {{did not become}} a member of the KNWU. Operating for a while independently, they formed another sanctioning body in 1987, the Nederlandse Fietscross Federatie (NFF), (in English the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Federation (DBMXF)).|$|E
25|$|Arguments such {{as these}} were used to oppose the suffragettes and, further, that the precise reform that they called for meant the {{extension}} of the existing franchise to women, along with the <b>then-existing</b> property qualifications.

25|$|Over time, Ward {{conducted}} Good Roads {{campaigns in}} forty-six of the <b>then-existing</b> forty-eight states – all except Nevada and New Hampshire. He conducted them in Canada as well, including {{the province of}} Nova Scotia, where the King road drag was found {{better than any other}} method to work sandy roads, clay roads and rock roads. One Canadian journalist was so impressed that he wrote and published this poem as his tribute to Ward.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{submission}} of a revised preliminary plat in 1980, the Commission raised eight {{objections to the}} development based on non-compliance with the county's <b>then-existing</b> zoning and development regulations. Following an administrative appeal, the County Board of Zoning Appeals ruled that the Commission should have applied the regulations and zoning that were in effect in 1973, when the original preliminary plat was filed. However, the Commission declined to follow this directive, and once again disapproved the revised plat.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, Annie Jump Cannon {{first noticed}} {{that it was}} a star's {{temperature}} that was the principal distinguishing feature among different spectra. This led to re-ordering of the ABC types by temperature instead of hydrogen absorption-line strength. Due to Cannon's work, most of the <b>then-existing</b> classes of stars were thrown out as redundant. Afterward, astronomy was left with the seven primary classes recognized today, in order: O, B, A, F, G, K, M; that has since been extended.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, 1975, the NYCTA {{announced}} that in September {{of that year}} 94 daily IRT trips would be discontinued, accounting for 4 percent of <b>then-existing</b> service on the IRT. The trips were to be discontinued to cut operating deficits. Express service on the 7 was to be discontinued between the hours of 9:30a.m. and 3:30p.m. and was {{to be replaced by}} more frequent local service. Also, during the same month, the NYCTA was considering making the A train a local at all times except rush hours, when it would remain an express.|$|E
25|$|The Parliament Acts {{have been}} used to pass {{legislation}} against the wishes of the House of Lords on seven occasions since 1911, including the passing of the Parliament Act 1949. Some constitutional lawyers had questioned the validity of the 1949 Act. These doubts were rejected in 2005 when members of the Countryside Alliance unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the Hunting Act 2004, which had been passed {{under the auspices of the}} Act. In October 2005, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords dismissed the Alliance's appeal against this decision, with an unusually large panel of nine Law Lords (out of <b>then-existing</b> twelve) holding that the 1949 Act was a valid Act of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Scranton {{was limited}} to one term under <b>then-existing</b> state law and Shafer was {{considered}} the most likely choice to succeed him as the Republican nominee. In the general election, he faced wealthy Philadelphia businessman Milton Shapp. The 1966 election was marked by tragedies. State Attorney General Walter Alessandroni, Shafer's running mate, {{was killed in an}} aviation accident during the campaign and won the Lt. Gov. nomination posthumously; Ray Broderick was named to replace him on the ticket. Former governor David L. Lawrence collapsed and fell into a coma during a campaign appearance for Shapp, and died later that November.

25|$|The International Terminal {{completed}} a continuous ring of terminals, by {{filling in the}} last remaining gap {{to the west of}} <b>then-existing</b> terminals. Its geometry required that the terminal structure be built above the main access road, at enormous expense, including building dedicated ramps for connectivity to Highway 101. The design and construction of the international terminal was by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Del Campo & Maru Architects, Michael Willis Associates, and built by Tutor Perini (main terminal building), Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum in association with Robin Chiang & Company, Robert B. Wong Architects, and built by Tutor Perini (Boarding Area G), and Gerson/Overstreet Architects and built by Hensel Phelps Construction (Boarding Area A). The contracts were awarded after an architectural design competition.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of the MADS-box family has been extensively studied. These genes are present even in pteridophytes, but the spread and diversity is many times higher in angiosperms. There appears {{to be quite a}} bit of pattern into how this family has evolved. Consider the {{evolution of}} the C-region gene AGAMOUS (AG). It is expressed in today's flowers in the stamens, and the carpel, which are reproductive organs. It's ancestor in gymnosperms also has the same expression pattern. Here, it is expressed in the strobili, an organ that produces pollens or ovules. Similarly, the B-genes' (AP3 and PI) ancestors are expressed only in the male organs in gymnosperms. Their descendants in the modern angiosperms also are expressed only in the stamens, the male reproductive organ. Thus, the same, <b>then-existing</b> components were used by the plants in a novel manner to generate the first flower. This is a recurring pattern in evolution.|$|E
25|$|Merging with Naniwa High School and Osaka High School as {{a result}} of the government's {{education}} system reform in 1949, Osaka University started its postwar era with five faculties: Science, Medicine, Engineering, Letters, and Law. After that, faculties, graduate schools, and research institutes have been successively established. Among these are the School of Engineering Science, the first of its kind among Japanese national universities, which draws upon the excellence of both sciences and engineering disciplines, and the School of Human Sciences, which covers its cross-disciplinary research interest as broadly as psychology, sociology, and education. Built on the <b>then-existing</b> faculties, 10 graduate schools were set up as part of the government's education system reform program in 1953. Two graduate schools, the Graduate School of Language and Culture and the cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional Osaka School of International Public Policy, add to the list, making the number of graduate schools reach 12 in 1994.|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 2006, Trasmediterranea {{started a}} service to Bilbao in {{competition}} with P's <b>then-existing</b> service. This service was criticised when the ferry Fortuny was detained in Portsmouth by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for numerous safety breaches. The faults were quickly corrected by Trasmediterránea, and the service was cleared to begin carrying passengers on 23May 2006. In March 2007, Trasmediterránea withdrew the Bilbao service at short notice, citing the need to deploy the Fortuny elsewhere. P Ferries ceased their service to Bilbao on 27September 2010, due to [...] "unsustainable losses". The port is the second-busiest ferry port in the UK after Dover, handling around three million passengers a year.|$|E
500|$|Of the British composers, Boult {{extensively}} {{recorded and}} sometimes re-recorded major works by Elgar and Vaughan Williams. He recorded all eight <b>then-existing</b> symphonies by Vaughan Williams for Decca in the 1950s with the LPO, {{in the presence}} of the composer. The recording producer, John Culshaw, wrote that the composer [...] "said very little during the sessions because he was totally in favour of Sir Adrian's approach to his music." [...] Vaughan Williams was to have been present for the first recording of his Ninth symphony, for Everest Records in 1958, but he died the night before the session took place; Boult recorded a short introduction as a memorial tribute. All these recordings have been reissued on CD. In the 1960s Boult re-recorded the nine symphonies for EMI.|$|E
500|$|The {{collision}} between terranes {{folded the}} Earth's crust, and produced enough heat and pressure to metamorphose <b>then-existing</b> rock. Repeated continental collisions, compression along a north-south axis, and subduction {{resulted in the}} uprising of the Algoman Mountains. This was followed by intrusions of granite plutons and batholithic domes within the gneisses about two examples are the Sacred Heart granite of southwestern Minnesota and the Watersmeet Domes metagabbros (metamorphosed gabbros) that straddle the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After the intrusions solidified, new stresses on the greenstone belt caused movement horizontally along several faults and moved huge blocks of the crust vertically relative to adjacent blocks. This combination of folding, intrusion and faulting built mountain ranges throughout northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, Michigan's Upper Peninsula and southernmost Ontario. Igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks {{are associated with the}} orogeny.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{national}} campaigns, Lansbury remained a Poplar borough councillor and [...] Poor Law guardian, and between 1910 and 1913 served [...] a three-year term as a London County Councillor. In 1919 {{he became the}} first Labour mayor of Poplar. [...] Under the <b>then-existing</b> financial system for local government, boroughs were individually responsible [...] for poor relief within their boundaries. This discriminated heavily against poorer councils such as Poplar, where rates revenues were low and [...] poverty and unemployment, always severe, were exacerbated in times of economic recession. Under this system, Postgate argues, [...] "The wealthy West End boroughs were evading responsibility, as though the desolate and silent docks were the results of a failure by the Poplar Borough Council". In addition to meeting the costs of its own obligations, the council was required to levy precepts [...] to pay for [...] services provided by [...] bodies such as the London County Council and the Metropolitan Police. [...] Lansbury had long argued that a degree [...] of rates equalisation across London was necessary, to share [...] costs more fairly.|$|E
500|$|Ferrocene was an {{extremely}} important compound in {{the early history of}} the branch of organometallic chemistry, and to this day iron {{is still one of the}} most important metals in this field. It was first synthesised in 1951 during an attempt to prepare the fulvalene (C10H8) by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene; the resultant product was found to have molecular formula C10H10Fe and reported to exhibit [...] "remarkable stability". The discovery sparked substantial interest in the field of organometallic chemistry, in part because the structure proposed by Pauson and Kealy (shown at right) was inconsistent with <b>then-existing</b> bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability. Consequently, the initial challenge was to definitively determine the structure of ferrocene in the hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood. The shockingly novel sandwich structure, , was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952: Robert Burns Woodward and Geoffrey Wilkinson investigated the reactivity in order to determine the structure and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule (such as benzene), Ernst Otto Fischer deduced the sandwich structure and also began synthesising other metallocenes including cobaltocene; Eiland and Pepinsky provided X-ray crystallographic confirmation of the sandwich structure.|$|E

Once molecular orbital theory was successfully applied, the reasons for ferrocene's remarkable stability became clear.|$|E
500|$|Stelmach {{ran for the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative in the 1993 provincial election, {{defeating}} incumbent New Democrat Derek Fox in {{the riding}} of Vegreville-Viking. Stelmach {{became a member of}} the Deep Six, a group of enthusiastically fiscally conservative rookie MLAs; in addition to supporting Premier Ralph Klein's aggressive deficit-cutting, Stelmach practiced fiscal restraint himself, incurring low office expenses and declining a government vehicle. [...] During his first term, Stelmach served as Deputy Whip and, later, Chief Government Whip for the P.C. caucus. [...] As a backbencher, he sponsored the Lloydminster Hospital Act Repeal Act. This was a government bill that dissolved the <b>then-existing</b> Lloydminster hospital board in preparation for an arrangement compliant with both the Alberta government's new system of regional health authorities and the Saskatchewan government's system. Lloydminster sits on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the hospital, although built and operated by the Alberta government, sits on the Saskatchewan side. It passed the legislature with little debate. In 1996, shortly before an April by-election in Redwater, Stelmach was accused of [...] "pork barrel politics" [...] for presenting, along with colleague Peter Trynchy and P.C. candidate Ross Quinn, a large cheque to a local seniors centre. Stelmach said that he had only stepped in to help the riding after its MLA, Nicholas Taylor, had been appointed to the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Agni's Philosophy is a tech demo {{created by}} Square Enix {{to show off}} the {{capacities}} of Luminous Studio. The demo was a collaboration between the cinematic Visual Works division—a section of the company generally associated with CGI movie production for the company's video games—and Square Enix's R department, Advanced Technology Division, with a goal to create a real-time graphics tech demo that has a quality coming {{as close as possible to}} pre-rendered CGI. Development of the demo took approximately half a year. Unlike previous technology demos created by the company, which were based on pre-existing games, Square Enix decided to create something completely original. The demo was themed around the Final Fantasy series: during discussions, the team asked the question [...] "What is Final Fantasy?", broke down its basic components and used them, along with added unusual elements, in the demo. A focus during the demo's development was the creation of Agni, the central character. For the demo, as it was a work-in-progress, they optimized it for graphical performance. While the story and themes were created by the Japanese staff, many of the character designs were done by staff from their western subsidiaries. The technology to create the demo was all sourced from <b>then-existing</b> high-end PCs. An initial mock up of Agni's hair was created using a mannequin and wig styled by a professional make-up artist. Each character's face was constructed around mo-capped footage of live actors, then tweaked and expanded in post-production. The entire development process, from conception through development, took approximately a year. Agni's Philosophy was first shown at E3 2012 as part of a special presentation by Square Enix. As part of the presentation, guest speakers paused the demo and adjusted elements of the characters on the fly {{to show off the}} engine's customization features. It was also shown at SIGGRAPH 2012.|$|E
