25|$|Traffic hit 201,864 {{passengers}} in 1993. That year Busy Bee folded and their regional routes were {{taken over by}} Norwegian Air Shuttle, using the Fokker 50. The airline market was deregulated on 1 April 1994; thereafter any airline was free to fly any route in Norway. SAS chose initially to not take up the competition with Braathens out of Molde, and the only immediate effect was a slight hike in ticket prices. Later that year Braathens increased from three to four daily services to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. An air show {{was held at the}} airport on 30 June 1996, but it proved a failure due <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> weather. The control tower was upgraded in 1997. As an interim solution a temporary tower was erected to serve in its place.|$|E
500|$|These arrays {{need to be}} spaced out {{to reduce}} inter-shading as the sun moves and the array orientations change, so need more land area. [...] They also require more complex {{mechanisms}} to maintain the array surface at the required angle. The increased output can be {{of the order of}} 30% in locations with high levels of direct radiation, but the increase is lower in temperate climates or those with more significant diffuse radiation, due <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> conditions. For this reason, dual axis trackers are most commonly used in subtropical regions, and were first deployed at utility scale at the Lugo plant.|$|E

60|$|It made Beaton {{feel very}} old; it somehow left him behind and forgotten; in a manner, {{it made him}} feel trifled with. Something of the unfriendliness of fate seemed <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> his resentment, and he allowed the sadness of his {{conviction}} that he had not the means to marry on to tinge his recognition of the fact that Alma Leighton would not have wanted him to marry her if he had. He was now often in that martyr mood in which he wished to help his father; not only to deny himself Chianti, but to forego a fur-lined overcoat which he intended to get for the winter, He postponed the moment of actual sacrifice as regarded the Chianti, and he bought the overcoat in an anguish of self-reproach. He wore it the first evening after he got it in going to call upon the Leightons, and it seemed to him a piece of ghastly irony when Alma complimented his picturesqueness in it and asked him to let her sketch him.|$|E

"I {{believe we}} have not heard from each other since {{the first days of}} [...] my poor Genevieve's marriage, when {{everything}} looked so bright and [...] fair, and we little realized the clouds that were <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> her [...] happiness. It is a long story, and I will not go into it fully. [...] The truth is that poor Gigi did not treat her very kindly, and that [...] she has not lived with him since the birth of their little girl, now [...] nearly two years old, and the sweetest little creature in the world; [...] I wish you could see her; I am sure it would inspire your pencil [...] with the idea of an angel-child. At first I hoped that the [...] separation would be only temporary, and that when Genevieve had [...] regained her strength she would be willing to go back to her [...] husband; but nothing would induce her to do so. In fact, poor Gigi [...] had spent all her money, and they would have had nothing to live [...] upon but his pay, and you know that the pay of the Italian officers [...] is very small.|$|E

60|$|Tim was incensed beyond measure. His {{marriage}} {{had so far}} been a total failure, a source of bitter regret; and the only course for improving his case, that of leaving the country, was a sorry, and possibly {{might not be a}} very effectual one. Do what he would, his domestic sky was likely <b>to</b> be <b>overcast</b> <b>to</b> the end of the day. Thus he brooded, and his resentment gathered force. He craved a means of striking one blow back at the cause of his cheerless plight, while he was still on the scene of his discomfiture. For some minutes no method suggested itself, and then he had an idea.|$|R
60|$|The Princess and the Absolute Fool journeyed {{on until}} near {{the close of}} the afternoon, when the sky began <b>to</b> be <b>overcast,</b> and it looked like rain. They were then not far from a large piece of water; and at a little distance, they saw a ship moored near the shore.|$|R

50|$|Australia, with Rear Admiral Victor Alexander Charles Crutchley, RN, on board, left {{formation}} for {{a command}} conference at Lunga Roads at 2130. Just over two hours later, with visibility low owing <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> sky and rain showers, unidentified ships loomed into view about 3000 yd distant {{on the port}} bow. These were seven Japanese cruisers and a destroyer under Rear Admiral Gunichi Mikawa sent from Rabaul to attack the American transports. At that moment, 0144 according to Bagleys log, float planes from the Japanese cruisers dropped flares that lit up the American warships.|$|E
50|$|Ambient {{lighting}} can {{be combined}} with ambient occlusion to represent how exposed each point of the scene is, affecting the amount of ambient light it can reflect. This produces diffuse, non-directional lighting throughout the scene, casting no clear shadows, but with enclosed and sheltered areas darkened. The result is usually visually similar <b>to</b> an <b>overcast</b> day.|$|R

The Horsas returned with the afternoon's second wave landing at 15:04.|$|R
50|$|Variations in {{temperature}} increase when moving north through a savanna and plateau toward the Sahel. A dry {{wind from the}} Sahara called the Harmattan blows from December to March, during which grass dries up, the vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies <b>to</b> be <b>overcast.</b> It is also the season when farmers burn brush in the fields.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to provide some daylight into spaces that have low possibility of windows or skylights through remote distribution devices such as light tube. Remote daylight distribution systems could be inherently inefficient and the further they have to transmit the daylight and the more convoluted the path, the greater is the inefficiency. The efficiency of many remote distribution systems can also vary dramatically from clear <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> skies. Nonetheless, {{where there is no}} other possibility of providing daylight to a space, remote distribution systems can be appreciated.|$|E
50|$|Relative {{humidity}} {{is always}} high {{throughout the year}} except in the winter months being slightly less humid. In the cold season, the sky is obscured on many mornings due to lifted fog which clears with the advance of the day generally, moderately clouded {{in the period of}} March to May, heavily clouded <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> in the monsoon season and clear or slightly clouded during the post monsoon season. Winds are generally light strong katabatic winds down the valleys are experienced as local effect produced by the nature of terrain.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{determined}} that the accident had been caused mainly by pilot error. Visibility was poor due <b>to</b> <b>overcast</b> and the ground proximity warning {{would not have been}} triggered in time because of the steep terrain. The approach plates for Kathmandu issued to PIA pilots were also determined to be unclear, and Nepalese air traffic controllers were judged timid and reluctant to intervene in what they saw as piloting matters such as terrain separation. The report recommended that ICAO review navigational charts and encourage their standardisation, and that the approach to Kathmandu Airport be changed to be less complex.|$|E

50|$|The European Union has a {{solar power}} output of about 90 gigawatts and {{production}} could have been temporarily decreased by up to 34 GW of that dependent on {{the clarity of the}} sky.
