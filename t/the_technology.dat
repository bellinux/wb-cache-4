Starscream and Sideways travel to the Laurentian Abyss, where the dead body of Megatron is being guarded by military forces. Starscream attacks the navy ships, giving Sideways an opportunity to retrieve the body. Megatron is then resurrected by The Fallen, becoming his servant.|$|E

The initiative, known as <b>the</b> <b>Technology</b> Demonstration Programme, was scheduled to last approximately 2.5years, during which further financing in the form of €1million was made available by the ESA.

40|$|Special ReportThe Transportation Safety Analysis and the Automotive Analysis Divisons at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) {{initiated}} <b>the</b> Onboard Safety <b>Technologies</b> {{project in}} 2007, supported by FMCSA, to collect {{detailed information about}} the penetration of onboard safety <b>technologies</b> in <b>the</b> trucking fleet and future use of these <b>technologies.</b> <b>The</b> five <b>technologies</b> examined included: lane departure warning (LDWS), electronic stability control (ESC), forward and side collision warning (FCWS/SCWS), and vehicle tracking systems (TRACKING). Previous work in estimating the penetration of onboard safety <b>technologies</b> never approached <b>the</b> question of <b>technology</b> penetration by sampling the popluation of trucking companies. This project uses that approach {{through the use of}} a random sample survey of the entire fleet of trucking companies to measure current penetration, future use, and the advantages available to companies employing these <b>technologies.</b> <b>The</b> source for the sample was the 2007 Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) file. Interviews were also conducted with companies with high penetration of <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> as well as system suppliers of <b>the</b> <b>technologies,</b> in order to gather more detailed information about usage and future <b>technology</b> direction. <b>The</b> results of the survey show the expected low levels of usage of LDWS, FCWS, and SCWS, slightly higher levels of usage of ESC, and much higher usage of TRACKING. Analysis shows higher usage related to larger company size. Company usage of these technologies is expected to double over the next five years. The main factors noted by participants for using <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> that vary little among <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> include: proven safety benefits of <b>the</b> <b>technologies,</b> positive feedback by drivers, driver improvement, improved safety culture, reduced cost of accidents, and insurance benefits.
