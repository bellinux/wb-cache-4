40|$|Microfluidics {{devices are}} {{important}} both for research use and medical application. To create these microfluidics devices, the hot embossing process is commonly used. In order to characterize this process to enable cycle to cycle control, a small-scale system was developed, using a hot embossing machine, <b>taping</b> <b>machine,</b> and functional tester previously created. Parts were moved between these machines with an Epson GlO SCARA robot, which provided the appropriate efficiency and accuracy. This system {{was able to}} produce embossed parts with a takt time of less than 135 seconds, and over 1000 of such parts were produced. The system was analyzed to determine potential sources of variance, considering both things that would alter the part and things that would alter the measurements. This enabled the system to be run {{in a state of}} statistical control, which in turn allowed for a designed experiment to be done on the system. This designed experiment determined that the forming temperature, forming force, forming time, as well as the square terms for the forming temperature and forming force and the cross-terms of forming force with forming temperature and forming time with forming temperature, were all statistically significant in the formation of parts. With this data, cycle-to-cycle control can be enabled in the future. by Katharine Luginbuhl. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2014.

The total cycle time of the testing machine is 85 seconds, which is well within the time of one embossing cycle (110 seconds). In order to produce complete devices for testing, an automated <b>taping</b> <b>machine</b> was also designed to seal the embossed channels. This machine took 15 seconds to complete its cycle. These two machines were integrated with the microfactory, which is currently capable of producing an embossed, sealed, and tested device every 170 seconds. The taping and width measurement processes have an error of 0. 63 μm with a standard deviation of 0. 82 [mu]m. The mixing length test has an accuracy of 72. 8 [mu]m. A preliminary test demonstrated the ability to generate credible run data, and the effect of embossing temperature on width was detected to a resolution of 2 [mu]m. The system is now able to characterize the embossing process and the effects of various embossing parameters on the final product. Closed-loop cycle-to-cycle process control can then be implemented, which will create a robust production cell that is capable of adapting to a variety of conditions. by Caitlin J. Reyda. Thesis: S.

50|$|One way of {{increasing}} the number of tracks available for recording is to synchronise <b>tape</b> <b>machines</b> together. Since the early 1970s SMPTE timecode has been used to synchronise <b>tape</b> <b>machines.</b> Modern SMPTE timecode controlled recorders provide a mechanism so that the second machine will automatically position the tape correctly and start and stop simultaneously with the master machine. However, in 1967, SMPTE timecode was not available and other techniques had to be used.|$|R

5000|$|Before digital recording, {{the total}} number of {{available}} tracks onto which one could record was measured in multiples of 24, {{based on the number of}} 24-track <b>tape</b> <b>machines</b> being used. In the 2010s, most recording studios now use digital recording equipment, which limits the number of available tracks only on the basis of the mixing console's or computer hardware interface's capacity and the ability of the hardware to cope with processing demands. Analog <b>tape</b> <b>machines</b> are still used by some audiophiles and sound engineers, who believe that digitally recorded audio as sounding too harsh and who believe that tape has a [...] "warmer" [...] sound. The scarcity and age of analog <b>tape</b> <b>machines</b> has increased their value, as does the fact that some audio engineers still believe in recording to analog tape.|$|R
