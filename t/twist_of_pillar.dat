The Minster, grand {{with the}} {{architecture}} of the time of Henry III., stood beside a broad river, and round it were the buildings of a convent, made by a certain good Bishop Whichcote, the nucleus of a grammar school, which had survived the Reformation, and trained up many good scholars; among them, one of England's princely merchants, Nicholas Randall, whose effigy knelt in a niche in the chancel wall, scarlet-cloaked, white-ruffed, and black doubletted, a desk bearing an open Bible before him, and a <b>twisted</b> <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> Derbyshire spar on each side. He was the founder of thirteen almshouses, and had endowed two scholarships at Oxford, the object of ambition of the Stoneborough boys, every eighteen months.|$|R

40|$|As is {{the case}} with many other substances, snow {{responds}} visco-elastically to a force applied to it provided that the force remains so small that it does not break down the snow. M. de Quervain studied the visco-elastic properties of snow and ice by <b>twisting</b> a <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> snow or ice and found that their mechanical properties could be qualitatively represented by a rheological model composed of a Maxwell unit and a Voigt unit in series connection (1). Exten-sive investigations on the viscous properties of snow, namely the creep phenome-non of snow, were performed by R. Haefeli as early as 1939 (2), and recently Edwin Bucher, from the rheological point of view, made studies on creep of snow by applying to it torsional, tensile and compressive force (3). The present authors too studied the visco-elastic properties of snow by compressing a <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> snow by a pressure not exceeding 30 gr-wt/cm 2. The method of compression was adopted since its simplicity allowed many samples of snow to be dealt with in a short time. Then the elastic constant E and the viscous constant 'f} measured in the present experiments were compressiv...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Orebodies {{in shear}} often fail catastrophically. In this paper, the failure process <b>of</b> <b>pillar</b> in shear was studied numerically by the self-developed 2 D Rock Failure Process Analysis code (abbreviated as RFPA 2 D). This work {{is focused on}} the {{appropriate}} pillar size for safe and economic extraction from orebodies under shear loading. Numerical simulation shows clearly that <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> different angle and different width to height ratio under different confining pressure have different shear strength and show different failure model. With the increase <b>of</b> <b>pillar</b> angle, the junction <b>of</b> <b>pillar</b> and roof firstly appears stress concentration. It leads to the generation of micro cracks and makes pillar happen failure from surface to inner. Pillars in shear often fail due to reduced confinement and increased brittleness. This paper indicates that RFPA code is a viable tool for providing explanation for failure mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>pillars</b> and guidelines for shear stress consideration in pillar design for orebodies in shear.
