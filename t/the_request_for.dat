5|$|Following {{the appellate}} ruling, on September 21, 2007, Judge Mauffray denied <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> Bell to be {{eligible}} for bail pending possible further appeal. On September 26, Parish Attorney Walters announced that the prosecution would not appeal the appellate ruling, but would try Bell as a juvenile. Bell was released on $45,000bond, subject to electronic monitoring and under the supervision of a probation officer.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August, the High Court {{dismissed}} <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> judicial review, thus {{giving the}} go-ahead {{for the government}} to demolish it. The judge ruled that the applicants had failed to establish that the government had acted perversely.|$|E

5|$|Citizen's Briefing Book {{is a work}} of {{suggestions}} by individuals compiled into a book format and submitted to President Barack Obama after his inauguration on January 20, 2009. Internet users originally posted their suggestions at Change.gov, with the plan that after Barack Obama was sworn in as President the website hosting the recommendations would direct users to Whitehouse.gov. The option to participate in <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> comment format was open until January 20, 2009, where users were able to post suggestions to the President, read others' recommendations, and comment on each other's ideas. Users voted on individual recommendations with an up or down vote for each suggestion.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, the US101 was {{selected}} for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> proposal (RFP) issued. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised {{that a lack of}} flexibility and compromise {{on the part of the}} government had negatively impacted the programme. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin {{told her he was}} marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the president has not responded to <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> {{a sequel}} {{prompted}} Tolkien to begin {{what would become}} his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent {{more than ten years}} writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C.S.Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it.|$|E
5|$|Winning the {{contract}} to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF {{would be a huge}} boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal as soon as <b>the</b> <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the {{government}} became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|After the Civil War, {{the region}} around {{the site of}} Cooper began to grow and develop. People in nearby Ben Franklin, Texas, grew tired of the poor road {{conditions}} that connected the region. In 1868, {{people in the area}} petitioned the state government to create a new county located between the north and south forks of the Sulphur River. On July 29, 1870, after two years of debating, the state of Texas granted <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> the new county. Shortly afterwards, the first settlements were built in Cooper and the town was established. The community was named after Leroy Cooper, the chairman of the Texas House Committee on Counties and Boundaries who helped establish the new county. Cooper was selected as the seat for the county, which would be named Delta County due to its triangular shape.|$|E
5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E
5|$|Churchill did {{not support}} the government, however. In July, he had advised the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected <b>the</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E

Vick's attorneys sought to resolve the state charges sooner. On October 14, 2008, Vick attorney Lawrence Woodward filed a motion to enter a plea via two-way electronic video with the Surry County Courts. Vick planned {{to plead guilty to}} state charges {{in an effort to get}} early release from federal prison and enter a halfway house. <b>The</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a trial without Vick physically present was denied, but Poindexter agreed to hold the state trial while Vick was still in federal custody if Vick bore the costs of his transportation to Virginia and related expenses.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... <b>The</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. <b>The</b> <b>request</b> <b>for</b> information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018.
