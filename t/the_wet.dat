5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during the end of <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season in late winter. This {{is because of the}} female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring at the start of <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wet</b> {{season is}} the main period of {{vegetation}} growth within the Savanna climate regime.

Malaria incidence increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall.|$|E

These two orientations give rise to two wetting transitions. Various edge configurations are predicted, depending on the surface tensions.

50|$|This {{measured}} pressure permits {{obtaining the}} pore diameter, which is calculated {{by using the}} Young-Laplace formula P= 4*γ*cos θ*/D in which D is the pore size diameter, P is the pressure measured, γ is the surface tension of <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid and θ is the contact angle of <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> liquid with <b>the</b> sample.

5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E

5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} breeds either {{alone or in}} small colonies {{averaging}} two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It {{has been suggested that}} this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with {{a few weeks before the}} onset of <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season; in areas where <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists of <b>the</b> <b>wet</b> season. Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon lay between November and April, birds in western Cameroon lay between March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May.

40|$|AbstractA {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> delay through jet impingement quenching of a high temperature brass block {{has been carried out}} in this study. The Liquids used for jet impingement on the brass surface are water and emulsion of cutting oil (used in machine shop) and water at a proportion of 1 : 20. The varying parameters used for the analysis are different velocities of jet (3 m/s, 5 m/s, 10 m/s) and initial block temperature from 250 < C to 450 < C at an interval of 50 < C. <b>The</b> <b>wetting</b> delay and wetting front propagation varied for different test conditions. When a liquid jet was impinged on the heated surface of the brass block, the jet remains stagnant up to a small region and the surface temperature decreases very slowly with time. After a certain interval, the surface temperature decreases at faster rate and <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> front starts to move in the radial direction. The time that passes during the stagnant period of <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> front is <b>the</b> <b>wetting</b> delay. <b>The</b> <b>wetting</b> delay in case of emulsion of cutting fluid is much higher as compared to water.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wet,</b> or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.
