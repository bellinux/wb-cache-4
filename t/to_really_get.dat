Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner {{has been}} {{believed}} to {{date back to}} Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians {{have yet to find}} a link between the grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria. The current name appeared in a document {{for the first time in}} 1855; before that time it was known as Weißgipfler. Only by the 1930s was Grüner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War it was regarded as just another Austrian grape. It took Lenz Moser's Hochkultur system of vine training <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> the best out of it, and it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria's most planted variety.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

In a finale that could have felt too scattered—we drop in on every major character of the season who’s still alive—that sense that cooler heads would rather prevent greater war but were thwarted by hotter, younger heads was what united the story".|$|E

Carter would replace Elizabeth Weir {{as the leader of}} the Atlantis Expedition after the episode. However, Carter would only have a supporting role as opposed to a lead role on SG-1. The episode would also give the audience [...] "an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> to know Dr. Jennifer Keller" [...] (Staite). Gero was reluctant to accept an updated opening title sequence, which mentioned the departure of Weir and the introduction of Carter, which would give the casual viewers a tip.|$|E

[...] All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film.|$|E

According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering.

500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{have welcomed}} the simplistic controls, but its [...] "hyper-responsiveness", with the {{characters}} easily dashing and precise movements being difficult to perform, was {{expressed as a}} serious flaw of the game by GameSpot. With a milder criticism of controls, Bryn Williams of GameSpy commented that [...] "movement and navigation seems slightly too sensitive". The basis of Melees gameplay system is the battles between Nintendo characters, which has been suggested as being overly hectic; N-Europe questioned whether the gameplay is [...] "too Frantic?", even though they enjoyed the variety of modes on offer. Similarly, Nintendo Spin's Clark Nielsen stated that [...] "Melee was too fast for its own good", and [...] "skill was more about {{just being able to}} wrap your head around what was happening as opposed <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> into the combat". In regards to the pace of the game, Edge commented that it even made gameplay features such as [...] "blocking" [...] redundant, as the player is not given enough time to react to an attack.|$|R

500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in a way you don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Season two {{also showed}} Lana's {{transition}} from the [...] "girl next door" [...] to a more [...] "self-reliant young woman". At {{the beginning of the}} season Lana is forced to come to terms with her diminished feelings for Whitney, as well as her growing feelings for Clark. It takes time before Lana is strong enough to finally tell Whitney the truth, in a video message, about the way she feels. The Talon, a local coffee shop co-owned by Lana, becomes her new grounding force as Whitney and her aunt have left Smallville. Kreuk thinks that it can be hard to believe that a sixteen-year-old girl could become co-owner of a coffee shop, but she believes that it helps to provide more independence for the character and establish her more within the show. Eventually, in order <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> to know herself, and find her role in life, Lana leaves Smallville for Paris. In season four, Kristin Kreuk felt like Lana is [...] "going a little crazy and is uncertain about her direction, and feels people aren't validating her beliefs".|$|E

Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, called the song [...] "dazed-sounding". Metro Times described Ahmadzai's programming as [...] "by far the best thing on the album". James Hannaham from Spin compared [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] to Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love", and deemed it as a highlight from the album. Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was [...] "insane" [...] with its electronic, chaotic, fast and manic pounding synths. [...] "There is so much going on here several it'll take several plays <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> it, but it's ace." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as the [...] "downright thrilling" [...] and [...] "deploys a shrewd little form-versus-content paradox".|$|E

[...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like.
