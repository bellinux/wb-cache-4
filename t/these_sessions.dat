A number of his compositions were recorded by Marley, Peter Tosh, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, and Neville Willoughby. Some of the tapes recorded by Norman during his sessions with Marley have been commercially released as part of the Marley compilation album, Soul Almighty.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, which were not used in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with the production of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> under the title It Happened One Bite. When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E

Fear members Mando Lopez and Richard Presley, and musician Jose Medeles, joined the line-up. The group continued recording with Albini in 2001. Title TK was compiled from {{the output of}} <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> and supplemented with two tracks recorded in Los Angeles with engineers Andrew Alekel and Mark Arnold. Of the twelve songs on the album, ten are credited solely to Kim Deal; {{the other two were}} written by all five band members.|$|E

An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black lingerie and a brown wig, holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.|$|E
5|$|Recording for Soul Food Taqueria {{took place}} at the {{recording}} studio of the San Francisco-based independent label Function 8 from 2002 to 2003. Mostly handled by Tommy Guerrero, production for the album also featured audio mixing contributions from producer/engineers Gadget and Monte Vallier. Prior to <b>these</b> <b>sessions,</b> Gadget and Guerrero had previously worked together on independent label projects and collaborations, including their collaborational studio effort, Hoy Yen Ass'n (2000) for Function 8. Most of the instrumentation for the album was employed by Guerrero, while session drummer Chuck Treece and keyboardist Greg Galbreath also contributed to Soul Food Taqueria. All of the album's material was written and arranged by Tommy Guerrero.|$|E
5|$|Records {{from the}} Scandinavian-held lands are much-less well {{documented}} by comparison. Udal law {{formed the basis}} of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl and the meetings were open to virtually all free men. At <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> decisions were made, laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include Tingwall and Law Ting Holm in Shetland, Dingwall in Easter Ross, and Tynwald on the Isle of Man.|$|E

5|$|The September 4 and 5 {{sessions}} featured only Jackson and Scott-Heron {{playing and}} recording. The limited personnel during <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> {{allowed them to}} rely mostly on traditional African and R sounds and influences, along with more creative and artistic control of the project. More {{than half of the}} album's songs were co-written and produced by Jackson. His input also helped solidify his partnership with Scott-Heron, leading to further records together before their split in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The {{sessions}} {{have been}} released in bootleg form as The Original Wicked Lester Sessions. Kiss officially released three tracks from <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> on their 2001 Box Set release. Wicked Lester's music featured elements of rock and roll, folk rock and pop. Simmons and Stanley, feeling that the group lacked a unifying musical vision, began forming a new band in late 1972. Adopting a more straightforward, harder rock sound and an emphasis on stage theatrics, they became the band Kiss in early 1973.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine surface motor {{activation}} zones for wrist, fingers and thumb extension movements and their temporal change during 20 therapy sessions using advanced multi-pad functional electrical stimulation system. Results from four hemiplegic patients indicate that certain zones have higher probability of eliciting each of the target movements. However, mutual overlap and variations of the zones are present not just between the subjects, but also on the intrasubject level, reflected through <b>these</b> <b>session</b> to session transformations of the selected virtual electrodes. The obtained results could be used as a priori knowledge for semi-automated optimization algorithm and could shorten the time required for calibration of the multi-pad electrode...|$|R

5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final albumâ€”"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. <b>These</b> <b>sessions,</b> augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several {{recording}} {{sessions at}} Cauty's studio, Trancentral. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that the Orb release their music through his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted {{to ensure that}} the group did not become a side-project of the KLF. Because of these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the Orb. As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as Space on KLF Communications. Also out of <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> came the KLF album Chill Out, on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.|$|E
5|$|Many {{rules and}} {{procedures}} in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution. Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee. The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor. The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being mandated by the state constitution. Seating in the Senate is by party, {{with the leaders of}} each party choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller Senate Office Building.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. The group {{returned}} to EMI Studios (now known as Abbey Road Studios) in May to commence recording sessions that lasted through to October. During <b>these</b> <b>sessions,</b> arguments broke out among the Beatles, and witnesses in the studio saw band members quarrel over creative differences. Another divisive element was the constant presence of John Lennon's new partner, Yoko Ono, whose attendance at the sessions broke with the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick quitting, Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year, leading to the eventual break-up of the Beatles in April 1970.|$|E
5|$|One of President Garfield's more wearying duties {{was seeing}} office seekers, {{and he saw}} Guiteau at least once. White House {{officials}} suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at <b>these</b> <b>sessions.</b> Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{season was}} preceded by three test sessions; one at Jerez de la Frontera and two in Barcelona. <b>These</b> <b>sessions</b> gave the teams and drivers the {{opportunity}} to familiarise themselves with their cars, though the teams downplayed the accuracy of testing times as being representative of the running order for the season. At the second test in Barcelona, Lotus F1 discovered a critical fault in the build of their chassis that forced them to miss four days of running, while both HRT and Marussia were unable to complete any mileage with their 2012 cars after both the HRT F112 and Marussia MR01 failed their crash tests, though both teams were able to complete shakedowns of their cars.|$|E

This is the most common strength of bitter sold in British pubs. It accounts for 16.9% of pub sales.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of the temple was completed ten days ahead of schedule, allowing for more non-member guests to visit the temple before the dedication. The King of Tonga was given a private tour of the temple by previous Tongan mission president John Groberg to explain {{the purposes of the}} building. Before its formal dedication, over 50 percent of the Tongan population had toured the temple. The church's Nuku'alofa Tonga Temple was dedicated in 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley as Kimball was ill and could not attend the dedication. There were seven dedicatory sessions held, most of which took place in the Liahona School gymnasium. 15,000 people were in attendance of <b>these</b> <b>sessions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first team}} of writers, {{assembled}} by Sam Simon, consisted of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Newer Simpsons writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas {{at the beginning}} of each December. The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, inserting scenes, and calling for re-readings of lines by the show's vocal performers. Until 2004, George Meyer, who had developed the show since the first season, was active in <b>these</b> <b>sessions.</b> According to long-time writer Jon Vitti, Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even though other writers may receive script credits. Each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from <b>these</b> <b>sessions</b> were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{qualitative}} approach to understanding how childhood abuse survivors experience and describe their sense of self, {{as well as how}} this experience of self changes over the course of therapy. Participants of the present study were adult clients engaging in Emotion Focused Therapy for Trauma (EFTT; Paivio 2 Ì† 6 Pascual-Leone, 2010) to address psychological effects of childhood maltreatment. The data source was audio-recorded therapy sessions in which clients discussed their experiences of self. The author identified and selected excerpts from <b>these</b> therapy <b>sessions</b> that contained client statements about their experience of self (e. g., perceptions and feelings about oneself, sense of identity, self in relation to others, self-conscious emotions, changes observed in self). <b>These</b> <b>session</b> excerpts were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis methodology (Braun 2 Ì† 6 Clarke, 2006). Analysis of <b>these</b> <b>session</b> excerpts yielded three major themes addressing the experience of self of childhood abuse survivors: an unclear sense of identity, not participating actively in one 2 Ì† 7 s life, and feelings of worthlessness. In terms of the process of change over the course of therapy sessions, analysis of client statements yielded themes relating to shifting blame for the abuse from self to the perpetrator, allowing and expressing emotions, and becoming aware of how positive experiences of self are blocked or disallowed. Near the end of therapy most clients reported changes in their experience of self, including a sense of authenticity and being true to oneself, feeling in control of life choices, and increased selfacceptance. The various themes are described and illustrated with excerpts of client statements. The themes are discussed in relation to current theory and research on the effects of childhood maltreatment, and implications of these findings are explored...|$|R
