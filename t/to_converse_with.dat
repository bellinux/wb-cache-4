5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> her and {{encourages}} her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, {{taking care to}} keep this secret from his wife, who would react with anger and jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{also had}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> spectators using a letter board. The director, whose {{identity}} during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, {{was able to do}} this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung (or On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.|$|E
5|$|In 1526, Portuguese ships {{arrived in}} Mangalore, {{and the number}} of local {{converts}} to Christianity slowly increased. However, a sizeable Christian population did not exist there until {{the second half of the}} 16th century, when there was a large-scale immigration of Christians from Goa to South Canara. They were reluctant to learn the local languages of South Canara and continued to speak Konkani, the language they brought from Goa, so that local Christians had to learn Konkani <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> them. After this migration, the skilled Goan Catholic agriculturists were offered various land grants by the native Bednore rulers of South Canara. They observed their traditional Hindu customs in conjunction with the newfound Catholic practices, and preserved their lifestyle.|$|E

In April 1865, Vallandigham testified at the {{conspiracy}} trial of the American Knights in Cincinnati, Ohio. He admitted <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> <b>with</b> Jacob Thompson, the Confederate agent in Canada.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a game of dice that {{combines}} multi-party communication with a tangible interface. The game {{has been used as}} a testbed to study typical conversational behavior patterns in interactions between human users and synthetic agents. In particular, we were interested in the question to what extent the interaction with the agent can be considered as natural. As an evaluation criterion, we propose to investigate whether the communicative behaviors of humans differ when <b>conversing</b> <b>with</b> an agent as opposed <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> <b>with</b> other humans...|$|R
5|$|The next day, August 16, {{the prisoners}} were moved with their guards. One of the mortarmen, Cpl. Roy L. Day Jr., spoke Japanese and was able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> some of the North Koreans. That {{afternoon}} he overheard a North Korean lieutenant say that they would kill the prisoners if other American forces advanced too close. Later that day other American forces began to assault Hill 303 to retake the position. B Company and several American tanks tried a second time to retake the hill, now estimated to contain a 700-man battalion. The 61st Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion fired on the hill during the day. That night, G Company succeeded in escaping from Hill 303. Guards took away five of the American prisoners; the others {{did not know what}} became of them.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
25|$|During the 2009 competition, held in Brighton, UK, the {{communication}} program restricted judges to 10 minutes for each round, 5 minutes <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> the human, 5 minutes <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> the program. This was {{to test the}} alternative reading of Turing's prediction that the 5-minute interaction was {{to be with the}} computer. For the 2010 competition, the Sponsor again increased the interaction time, between interrogator and system, to 25 minutes, well above the figure given by Turing.|$|E

25|$|Eden learned French and German on {{continental}} {{holidays and}} as a child spoke French better than English. Although Eden was fluent in French and German and able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> the Chinese premier Chou En-lai in French at Geneva in 1954, he preferred to have diplomats present to translate at meetings {{out of a sense}} of professionalism, as when he met Hitler in February 1934.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} to the commentary tradition {{is the work of}} the great Theravada scholastic Buddhaghosa (4-5th century CE), who is responsible for most of the Theravada commentary literature that has survived (any older commentaries have been lost). Buddhaghosa wrote in Pali, and after him, most Sri Lankan Buddhist scholastics did as well. This allowed the Sri Lankan tradition to become more international through a lingua franca so as <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> monks in India and later Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|Gravano {{had been}} {{consulting}} a hypnotist named Halpern {{to deal with}} fears he had, and Gotti's lawyers wanted to call Halpern as a witness, but the judge refused. Gravano had told Halpern he was deathly afraid of going to prison. Gotti informed Gravano {{he would not be}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> his lawyers unless Gotti was present. Gravano claimed Gotti's defense to consist of Gotti's lawyers portraying Gotti as a peace-loving boss falling all over himself to restrain the kill-crazy Gravano, resulting in a conviction for Gravano and an acquittal for Gotti.|$|E
30|$|Think-Pair-Share: Students {{are asked}} {{to think about a}} {{question}} posed by the instructor and then discuss it with one or two partners. Students could also be asked to write down their thoughts prior <b>to</b> <b>conversing</b> <b>with</b> a partner. After some time (five or so minutes), students are encouraged to share their thoughts {{with the rest of the}} class. This activity may also be helpful during lectures; the lecturer may ask questions and put students in pairs to become more actively involved in the material.|$|R

On Day 26, he finished as the runner-up, losing to his fellow housemate Shilpa Shetty. His younger sister, La Toya Jackson joined as a housemate in the later sixth celebrity series in January 2009.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{the story}} of the Eritrean patriot was rewritten by Ethiopian comedian Yilma Manaye in his work Zeraye Derese. This {{character}} was interpreted by Wegayehu Nigatu (1944–1990), a popular actor at the Ethiopian National Theater in Addis Ababa at the time. When the play was staged in Eritrea at Asmara's Opera, Wegayehu Nigatu's interpretation of Zerai was successfully received by the audience and his performance was so convincing that Tesfazien Deres wanted to host the actor for two weeks in order to have the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> him as with his dead brother.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} it was not {{sufficient}} for the husband simply to say to his wife (in the presence of two witnesses) not <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> a man. And if she nonetheless conversed with him, she was still permitted to her husband and (if a daughter of a Kohen) still permitted to eat from sacrifices. If, however, she entered a private place with the man and stayed with him long enough to have committed misconduct, she was forbidden to her husband and forbidden to eat from sacrifices, and if her husband died, she was required to perform the ceremony of halizah and could not contract a levirate marriage.|$|E

25|$|Written and {{designed}} by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy creator Douglas Adams, Starship Titanic began development in 1996 and {{took two years}} to develop. In order to achieve Adams's goal of being able <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> characters in the game, his company developed a language processor to interpret player's input and give an appropriate response and recorded over 16 hours of character dialogue. Oscar Chichoni and Isabel Molina, artists on the film Restoration (1995), served as the game's production designers {{and designed}} the ship's Art Deco visuals. The game's voice cast includes Monty Python members Terry Jones and John Cleese. A tie-in novel titled Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic was written by Jones and released in October 1997.|$|E
25|$|The English Catholic exiles {{eventually}} {{split into}} two parties, the one, called the Spanish faction, supporting {{the claims of the}} Infanta of Spain to the English crown, while the other, denominated the Scottish faction, advocated the right of James VI of Scotland. Paget was the acknowledged head of the Scottish faction, and in 1599 he threw up his employment under the King of Spain, and returned to Paris. Among the State Papers is a letter from a Catholic in Brussels to his friend, a monk at Liege, giving a detailed account of Paget and his 'practices'. The writer says that from the first hour that his years permitted him <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> men, he has been tampering in broils and practices, betwixt friend and friend, man and wife, and, as his credit and craft increase, betwixt prince and prince.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} {{of the young man}} with whom Beineman had last been seen alive was heard by a patrolman named Larry Mathewson, who believed the person described by Mrs. Goshe and others may be one John Norman Collins: a former fraternity member of his who had previously been interviewed but eliminated from police inquiries, and who he had himself seen riding his motorcycle around the Eastern Michigan University campus on the afternoon of July 23. When Mathewson questioned Collins on July 25 as to his movements two days earlier, he admitted that on the date in question he had been riding his Triumph Bonneville in the vicinity, and that he had stopped <b>to</b> <b>converse</b> <b>with</b> a former girlfriend of his while doing so (the point at which Mathewson had observed him). This former girlfriend was able to provide Mathewson with two recent photographs of Collins. When Mathewson showed these photographs to both Mrs. Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding, both women were adamant the man in the photographs was the same individual with whom Beineman had last been seen alive.|$|E
