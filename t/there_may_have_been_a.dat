5|$|In 1983, {{during an}} {{excavation}} by South Trafford Archaeological Group, fragments of Roman pottery {{were found in}} the area now occupied by the cemetery – previously the site of Urmston Old Hall – suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Roman settlement on the site. In the early 13th century, Lord Greenhalgh and his family lived at Highfield House (under what is now the M60 motorway).|$|E
5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books {{that were in the}} cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E
5|$|The city of Chester was an {{important}} Roman stronghold. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Christian basilica {{on the site of}} the present cathedral in the late Roman era, while Chester was controlled by Legio XX Valeria Victrix. Legend holds that the basilica was dedicated to Saint Paul and Saint Peter. This is supported by evidence that in Saxon times the dedication of an early chapel on this site was changed from SaintPeter to SaintWerburgh.|$|E

5|$|To {{fill the}} void left by {{the demise of the}} Susquehannocks, the Iroquois {{encouraged}} displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware). The valleys of Pine Creek and its tributaries in Cummings Township were used by the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes as a hunting ground. Historians believe that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Shawnee village and burial ground just to the north of Little Pine State Park on Little Pine Creek, {{just a few miles from}} what became Upper Pine Bottom State Park.|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|The war {{came to a}} {{disastrous}} end in 1828, as Brazil relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. Nonetheless, Luís Alves was promoted {{to the rank of}} major on 2 December 1828 and made second-in-command of the Emperor's Battalion in early 1829. During his stay in Montevideo, he met María Ángela Furriol González Luna. How far their relationship progressed is unknown, but <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> failed engagement. He returned to Rio de Janeiro and witnessed the increasing deterioration in Emperor PedroI's political position. A growing opposition to PedroI's policies eventually erupted into mass protests at the Field of Santana in downtown Rio de Janeiro on 6 April 1831. The situation became more ominous when several military units, led by Luís Alves' father and uncles, joined the protests.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} small finds of Roman coins {{throughout}} the Sheffield area, for example 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in Pitsmoor in 1906, and ten coins {{were found at}} a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along {{with the name of}} the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Roman camp at this site. It is unlikely that the settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian farmstead site at Whirlow Hall Farm in South-west Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Xinhua News Agency {{published}} an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual {{by the name of}} Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died. Xinhua alleged that Gui Minhai (桂敏海), with a different but identical-sounding middle character with respect to Gui Minhai the publisher, had fled abroad under the guise of a tourist in November 2004 using a borrowed identity card following the court case; his stated age was 46 years in 2005 – a discrepancy of five years compared with the details in Gui's Swedish passport. The two discrepancies created doubts that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} antiquity, Imbros, like Lemnos, was an Athenian cleruchy, {{a colony}} whose settlers retained Athenian citizenship; although since the Imbrians {{appear on the}} Athenian tribute lists, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> division with the native population. The original inhabitants of Imbros were Pelasgians, as mentioned by Herodotus in The Histories.|$|E
25|$|Brittonic, {{including}} the living languages Breton, Cornish, and Welsh, and the extinct languages Cumbric and Pictish though Pictish {{may be a}} sister language rather than a daughter of Common Brittonic.

25|$|The town lies on {{the line}} of the Roman road from London to Portslade, and there is some archaeological {{evidence}} for small-scale Roman settlement in the area: <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> mansio (staging-post) here. Later, in the 5th to 7th centuries, a large pagan Saxon cemetery was situated on what is now Park Lane, although the extent of any associated settlement is unknown.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> two-pronged attack by Godwinson on Hardrada's army, making use of both the ford and perhaps {{the remnants of the}} earlier Roman bridge one mile to the south, information of which, and of the two road routes to the location from York, could have been gathered from Godwinson's earlier occupation of the city of York. However, no documentation exists to support this possibility.|$|E
25|$|Flux: This {{ingredient}} {{was used}} to lower the melting point of the silica to form glass.

During this period, {{the primary source of}} soda was natron, a naturally occurring salt found in dry lake beds. The main source of natron during the Roman period was Wadi El Natrun, Egypt, although <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> source in Italy.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> single author for {{the gospel}} {{and the three}} epistles. Tradition {{attributes}} all the books to John the Apostle. Most scholars agree that all three letters are written by the same author, although there is debate on who that author is. Although some scholars conclude {{the author of the}} epistles was {{different from that of the}} gospel, all four works probably originated from the same community, traditionally and plausibly attributed to Ephesus, c. 90-110, but perhaps, according to some scholars, from Syria.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark, old ballads {{mention a}} closed circle dance which can open into a chain dance. A fresco in Ørslev church in Zealand from about 1400 shows nine people, men and women, dancing in a line. The leader {{and some others}} in the chain carry {{bouquets}} of flowers. In the case of women's dances, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> man who acted as the leader. In Sweden, medieval songs often mentioned dancing. A long chain was formed, with the leader singing the verses and setting the time while the other dancers joined in the chorus.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> third {{traditional}} {{church in}} Boho parish called Templemollem or the Church of the Mill, which is {{mentioned in the}} Survey of 1603 and in the Inquisition of 1609. This was the chapel of ease called Templemullin on a tate of land owned by the sept of the McGaraghan which had an annual tribute to pay to the former Lisgoole Abbey of five gallons of butter and one axe. It is also thought that the pre-reformation church in Toneel North may have been built on an even older a pre-Christian pagan amphitheatre.|$|E
