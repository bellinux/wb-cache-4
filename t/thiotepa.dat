40|$|AIMS: <b>Thiotepa</b> {{is widely}} used in {{high-dose}} chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown relations between exposure and severe organ toxicity. <b>Thiotepa</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P 450 and glutathione S-transferase enzymes. Polymorphisms of these enzymes may affect elimination of <b>thiotepa</b> and tepa, its main metabolite. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate effects of known allelic variants in CYP 2 B 6, CYP 3 A 4, CYP 3 A 5, GSTA 1 and GSTP 1 genes on pharmacokinetics of <b>thiotepa</b> and tepa. METHODS: White patients (n = 124) received a high-dose regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, <b>thiotepa</b> and carboplatin as intravenous infusions. Genomic DNA was analysed using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Plasma concentrations of <b>thiotepa</b> and tepa were determined using validated GC and LC-MS/MS methods. Relations between allelic variants and elimination pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (nonmem). RESULTS: The polymorphisms CYP 2 B 6 C 1459 T, CYP 3 A 4 * 1 B, CYP 3 A 5 * 3, GSTA 1 (C- 69 T, G- 52 A) and GSTP 1 C 341 T had a significant effect on clearance of <b>thiotepa</b> or tepa. Although significant, most effects were generally not large. Clearance of <b>thiotepa</b> and tepa was predominantly affected by GSTP 1 C 341 T polymorphism, which had a frequency of 9. 3 %. This polymorphism increased non-inducible <b>thiotepa</b> clearance by 52 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 41, 64, P < 0. 001] and decreased tepa clearance by 32 % (95 % CI 29, 35, P < 0. 001) in heterozygous patients, which resulted in an increase in combined exposure to <b>thiotepa</b> and tepa of 45 % in homozygous patients.

Plasma concentrations of cyclophosphamide and 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometric detection; plasma concentrations of <b>thiotepa</b> and tepa were determined using gas chromatography. Pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and <b>thiotepa</b> were assessed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling. The study showed that alteration of a fractionated high-dose regimen into a simplified unfractionated regimen resulted in saturation of <b>thiotepa</b> elimination, with a Vmax of 212 (+/- 58) micromol/h and a Km of 13. 7 (+/- 5. 9) microM. This resulted in an increased dose-corrected exposure to <b>thiotepa</b> (13 %) and decreased dose-corrected exposure to its metabolite tepa (21 %). Elimination of cyclophosphamide was not shown to be saturable. Dose-corrected exposures to cyclophosphamide and its active metabolite 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide were comparable in both regimens.

METHODS: Blood samples were collected on day 1 and 3 and plasma levels of cyclophosphamide, its active metabolite 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide, <b>thiotepa,</b> its main metabolite tepa and carboplatin were determined. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the elimination of cyclophosphamide, <b>thiotepa,</b> carboplatin, but especially tepa was strongly reduced in this patient, resulting in increased exposures to these compounds of 67, 43, 30 and 157 %, respectively, compared to a reference population (n = 24) receiving similar doses.

Six escalating dose levels of cyclophosphamide and <b>thiotepa</b> were planned, beginning at cyclophosphamide 1. 5 [*]g m− 2 and <b>thiotepa</b> 200 [*]mg[*]m− 2. At least three patients were enrolled for each dose level. Eighteen patients completed the study. The maximum tolerated dose was 3000 [*]mg[*]m− 2 cyclophosphamide and 400 [*]mg[*]m− 2 <b>thiotepa</b> per course. Haematological toxicity was manageable on an outpatient basis and did not increase significantly with dose escalation. Dose-limiting toxicity was chemotherapy-induced immuno-suppression, which resulted in one toxic death and two life-threatening infections. Median times to treatment failure and survival were 11 and 26 months, respectively. Three patients were alive, free of disease 30 months after completion of the study. Such therapy allows for high-dose intensity and high cumulative doses on {{a short period of}} time with manageable toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Cyclophosphamide (CP) {{is widely}} used in {{high-dose}} chemotherapy regimens in combination with <b>thioTEPA.</b> CP is a prodrug and is activated by cytochrome P 450 to 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide (HCP) which yields the final cytotoxic metabolite phosphoramide mustard (PM). The metabolism of CP into HCP exhibits autoinduction but is inhibited by <b>thioTEPA.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the bioactivation route of CP incorporating the phenomena of both autoinduction and the drug-drug interaction between CP and <b>thioTEPA.</b> Plasma samples were collected from 34 patients who received high-dose CP, <b>thioTEPA</b> and carboplatin in short infusions during 4 consecutive days. Elimination of CP was described by a noninducible route and an inducible route leading to HCP. The latter route was mediated by a hypothetical amount of enzyme. Autoinduction leads to a zero-order increase in amount of this enzyme during treatment. Inhibition by <b>thioTEPA</b> was modeled as a reversible, competitive, concentration-dependent inhibition. PM pharmacokinetics were described by first-order formation from HCP and first-order elimination. The final models for CP, HCP, and PM provided an adequate fit of the experimental data. The volume of distribution, noninducible and initial inducible clearances of CP were 31. 0 L, 1. 58 L/hr and 4. 76 L/hr, respectively. The enzyme amount increased with a zero-order rate constant of 0. 041 amount * hr- 1. After each <b>thioTEPA</b> infusion, however, approximately 80 % of the enzyme was inhibited. This inhibition was reversible with a half-life of 6. 5 hr. The formation and elimination rate constants of PM were 1. 58 and 0. 338 hr- 1, respectively. The developed model enabled the assessment of the complex pharmacokinetics of CP in combination with thio TEPA. This model provided an adequate description of enzyme induction and inhibition and can be used for treatment optimization in this combinatio...|$|E
40|$|PATIENT AND METHOD: A 42 -year-old male {{patient with}} {{relapsing}} germ-cell cancer {{was enrolled in}} a salvage protocol that employed two 4 -day courses of CTC high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (1, 500 mg m(- 2) day(- 1)), <b>thiotepa</b> (120 mg m(- 2) day(- 1)), and carboplatin, followed by peripheral blood progenitor cell support. From five days {{before the start of the}} second CTC course the patient received phenytoin for generalized epileptic seizures. Blood samples were collected on day 1 of both CTC courses and analyzed for cyclophosphamide and its activated metabolite 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide, and for <b>thiotepa</b> and its main active metabolite tepa. RESULTS: Exposure (expressed as area under the plasma concentration vs time curve) to 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide and tepa in the second CTC course was increased by 51 % and 115 %, respectively, compared with the first CTC course, whereas exposure to cyclophosphamide and <b>thiotepa</b> was significantly reduced (67 % and 29 %, respectively). Because high exposure to 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide and tepa correlates with increased toxicity, the treatment risk of this patient was significantly increased. Therefore doses were reduced on the third day of the second course. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that phenytoin significantly induces both cyclophosphamide and <b>thiotepa</b> metabolism, most probably by induction of the cytochrome p 450 enzyme system. This potential clinical significant interaction should be taken into account when phenytoin is administered in combination with cyclophosphamide and <b>thiotepa</b> in clinical practic...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} cytotoxicities {{of the four}} drugs most {{frequently}} used for intravesical chemotherapy (Adriamycin, epodyl, mitomycin C, <b>Thiotepa)</b> and epirubicin were compared using monolayers and multicellular tumor spheroids of the human bladder cancer cell line, MGH-U 1. Adriamycin and epirubicin were most cytotoxic against monolayer cultures, whereas mitomycin C killed more cells in spheroids. Epodyl was least cytotoxic against both two- and three-dimensional cultures. <b>Thiotepa</b> was the only drug more cytotoxic to three- than two-dimensional cultures. Topographic analysis of bromodeoxyuridine-stained nuclei using image analysis indicated that Adriamycin selectively removed or killed superficial cells in multicellular tumor spheroids, but {{had little effect on}} DNA synthesis within the spheroids. In contrast <b>Thiotepa</b> killed cells throughout the spheroids. These in vitro data appear to reflect clinical experience using intravesical chemotherapy to treat superficial bladder cancer...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Relationships between {{toxicity}} and pharmacokinetics {{have been}} shown for cyclophosphamide, <b>thiotepa,</b> and carboplatin (CTC) in high-dose chemotherapy. We prospectively evaluated whether variability in exposure to CTC and their activated metabolites can be decreased with pharmacokinetically guided dose administration and evaluated its clinical effect. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received multiple 4 -day courses of cyclophosphamide (1, 000 - 1, 500 mg/m 2 /d), <b>thiotepa</b> (80 - 120 mg/m 2 /d), and carbop latin (area under the plasma concentration-time curve 3. 3 - 5 mg x min/mL/d). Doses were adapted on day 3 based on pharmacokinetic analyses of cyclophosphamide, 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide, <b>thiotepa,</b> tepa, and carboplatin done on day 1 using a Bayesian algorithm. Doses were also adjusted before and during second and third courses. Observed toxicity was compared with that in patients receiving standard dose CTC (n = 43). RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (108 courses) were included. For cyclophosphamide, <b>thiotepa,</b> and carboplatin, a total of 39, 58, and 65 dose adaptations were done within courses and 17, 40, and 43 before courses. The precision within which the target exposure was reached improved compared with no adaptation, especially after within-course adaptations (precision for cyclophosphamide, <b>thiotepa,</b> and carboplatin is 19 %, 16 %, and 13 %, respectively); > 85 % led to an exposure within +/- 25 % of the target compared with 60 % without dose adjustments. Toxicity {{was similar to that}} in a reference population, although the incidence of veno-occlusive disease was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian pharmacokinetically guided dosing for CTC was feasible and led to a marked reduction in variability of exposur...|$|E
40|$|Background: Exposure to the {{chemotherapeutic}} {{alkylating agent}} <b>thiotepa</b> during brain development leads to neurological complications arising from neurodegeneration and irreversible {{damage to the}} developing central nerve system (CNS). Administration of single dose of <b>thiotepa</b> in 7 -d postnatal (P 7) rat triggers activation of apoptotic cascade and widespread neuronal death. The present study was aimed to elucidate whether nicotinamide may prevent thiotepa-induced neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain. Methodology/Principal Findings: Neuronal cell death induced by <b>thiotepa</b> {{was associated with the}} induction of Bax, release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria into the cytosol, activation of caspase- 3 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP- 1). Post-treatment of developing rats with nicotinamide suppressed thiotepa-induced upregulation of Bax, reduced cytochrome-c release into the cytosol and reduced expression of activated caspase- 3 and cleavage of PARP- 1. Cresyl violet staining showed numerous dead cells in the cortex hippocampus and thalamus; post-treatment with nicotinamide reduced the number of dead cells in these brain regions. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and immunohistochemical analysis of caspase- 3 show that thiotepa-induced cell death is apoptotic and that it is inhibited by nicotinamide treatment. Conclusion: Nicotinamide (Nic) treatment with <b>thiotepa</b> significantly improved neuronal survival and alleviated neurona...|$|E
