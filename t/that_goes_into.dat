5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> the bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but {{little is known about}} absorption rates in children.|$|E

25|$|Need for {{cognition}} {{is associated}} with the amount of thought <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> making a decision. Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment. People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts, that is, heuristic biases. People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought.|$|E

Even assuming shielding were provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.|$|E

The work <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> making the garments is generally divided among several artisans, specializing in a particular process: dying (especially if the ikat method is used), weaving and knotting the fringes. The rebozos of Tenancingo are made with commercial cotton thread and often tied with the ikat method to make traditional designs with names such as arco de Granada, flor de haba, labor doble, llovizna, palacios, venados, ratoncitos and coyotes.|$|E

It also provides intelligence assistance, integration and coordination across uniformed military service intelligence components, which remain structurally separate from DIA. The agency's role encompasses the collection and analysis of military-related foreign political, economic, industrial, geographic, and medical and health intelligence.

50|$|In {{terms of}} {{reducing}} rate increases for consumers, the 2012 KFF study showed that, on average, the rates <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> effect after {{implementation of the}} ACA’s rate review provisions were 20.1% lower than rates initially requested by insurers. This has resulted in an estimated $1 billion in savings for consumers. The rates <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> effect in the individual market were 1.4 percentage points lower than the rates originally proposed by insurance companies, which equated to nearly $425 million in savings for consumers. In the small group market, rates <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> effect were 0.8 percentage points lower, which equated to over $600 million in savings.|$|R

25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> the aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume {{is known as the}} total stroke volume of the left ventricle.|$|E

The film was poorly reviewed, currently holding a 30% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was made for about $19 million and was given a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films {{in order to avoid the}} marketing input <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> most films that results in trying to make films appeal to too wide an audience.|$|E

However, {{she said she did}} not believe in extramarital sex and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous. She told Klinkenberg in 1992, frankly, that she had not had sex since her divorce, saying [...] "I wasn't a wild woman". However, she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work.

While another reviewer for 4Gamer could not deny the lower visual quality of the performances compared to previous Idolmaster games, the unexpectedly high sound quality of the songs in combination with well-done dance sequences, albeit on a small screen, was considered by this reviewer as [...] "thoroughly enjoyable." [...] Miyokawa also praised the additional gameplay <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> minutely adjusting an idol's choreography, but described it as extremely difficult to do well. However, the game's overall degree of difficulty compared to previous Idolmaster games is described as having decreased. The songs introduced in Dearly Stars such as [...] "Hello!!"

In the adverts, Victor breaks the proverbial fourth wall, and begins speaking to the Zellers shopper on the other side of the television screen, praising her admirable combination of style and thrift. He steps closer and squashes his nose against the camera lens. According to the website StrategyOnline, the promotional ad campaign for Zellers featuring Victor proved to be the most popular installment to date as of May 1999; the staff of StrategyOnline wrote that the campaign [...] "has garnered considerable praise in the marketing community – and small wonder.
