5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of the}} race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>a</b> competitive primary campaign.

Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E

5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August.

In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>a</b> fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
