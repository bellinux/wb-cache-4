5|$|Symptoms {{of malaria}} can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, {{recurrence}} {{can be classified}} as either recrudescence, relapse, or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood {{as a result of}} inadequate or ineffective treatment. Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells. Relapse commonly occurs between 8–24 weeks and is commonly seen with P.vivax and P.ovale infections. P.vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite. Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to <b>treatment</b> <b>failure.</b> People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as <b>treatment</b> <b>failure</b> in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} of sulfadoxine-pyremethamine (SP) monotherapy and establish the prevalence of mutations in dhfr and dhps in Brazzaville, Congo. METHOD We recruited 97 patients aged 6 - 59 months with uncomplicated malaria who attended Tenrikyo public health Centre. Eighty-three were followed until day 28. SP efficacy {{was determined by the}} WHO 28 -day test and analysis of mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and clihydropteroate synthase (pfhbps) genes. RESULTs There were seven (8. 4 %) early <b>treatment</b> <b>failures,</b> 23 late <b>treatment</b> <b>failures</b> (27. 7 %), nine (10. 8 %) late parasitological failures and 44 (53 %) adequate clinical and parasitological responses (ACPR). After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 64 available samples, the corrected results there were 44 (68. 8 %) ACPR and 19 recrudescent cases (31. 2 %). Approximately, 97. 5 % of samples bore the Asn 51 lle mutation, 66. 2 % the Cys 59 Arg mutation and 98. 8 % the Ser 108 Asn mutation. Mutations of dhps at positions 437 (Ala-Gly) and 436 (Ser-Ala) were found in 85 % and 12. 5 % of samples. Quadruple mutations (pfdhfr triple mutations in codons 51, 59 and 108 + pfdhps mutation in 437) were found in 42 samples (52. 5 %) and associated with <b>treatment</b> <b>failures.</b> CONCLUSION This high level of <b>treatment</b> <b>failures</b> and mutations in both genes calls for the urgent application of the new policy for malaria treatment to delay the spread of SP resistance...|$|R

25|$|Data {{on the use}} of {{postoperative}} {{radiation therapy}} (PORT) is largely confined to historical or retrospective studies rather than high quality randomized clinical trials and are based on the overall population of patients with head and neck cancer, rather than specific studies of HPV+OPC, which would have formed a very small proportion of the population studied. Despite surgical excision, in the more advanced cases local and regional recurrence of the cancer, together with spread outside {{of the head and neck}} region (metastases) are frequent. The risk of subsequent recurrent disease is highest in those tumours where the pathology shows tumour at the margins of the resection (positive margins), multiple involved regional lymph nodes and extension of the tumour outside of the capsule of the lymph node (extracapsular extension). PORT was introduced in the 1950s in an attempt to reduce <b>treatment</b> <b>failure</b> from surgery alone. Although never tested in a controlled setting, PORT has been widely adopted for this purpose. In an analysis of surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>failure</b> at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, patients treated with surgery alone between 1960–1970 had failure rates of 39 and 73% for those with negative and positive surgical margins respectively. These were compared to those who received PORT (with or without chemotherapy) from 1975–1980. The latter group had lower failure rates of 2% and 11% respectively. In addition, one randomised study from the 1970s (RTOG 73-03) compared preoperative radiation to PORT, and found lower failure rates with the latter.|$|E
25|$|If HIV {{treatment}} {{has to be}} started while a patient is still on TB treatment, then {{the advice of a}} specialist HIV pharmacist should be sought. In general, there is no significant interactions with the NRTI's. Nevirapine should not be used with rifampicin.

Efavirenz levels should be checked early after starting treatment (unfortunately, this is not a service routinely offered in the US, but is readily available in the UK).

25|$|Excisional biopsies may {{remove the}} tumor, but further surgery is often {{necessary}} {{to reduce the}} risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 1 to 2cm margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 0.5cm. Many surgeons consider 0.5cm the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ, but 0.2cm margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of <b>treatment</b> <b>failure</b> in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.|$|E
25|$|Resistance is a {{major cause}} of <b>treatment</b> <b>failure</b> in {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.|$|E
