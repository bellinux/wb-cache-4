40|$|ABSTRACT. A manned {{submersible}} {{was used}} in a fjord in southeastern Alaska to study the distributional patterns of the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) and the Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) in summer. The cove was divided into three zones: inner, middle, and outer. Six types of habitats, including sand-mud, rock, shell, debris, rock wall, and algae, were identified from video tapes. A relatively flat sand-mud habitat located {{at the center of}} the cove occupied 60 % of the sea bottom. This large habitat was bordered by steep rocky walls on both sides in most parts of the fjord except in the inner zone. The density of red king crab decreased from the inner zone to the outer zone, while the density of the Tanner crab was more uniform throughout the cove. Highest crab density was found in the sand-mud habitat with an overall density of 51 crabs ha- 1 for the red king crab and 41 crabs ha- 1 for the Tanner crab. No crabs were found in rock wall and algae habitats. Both crab species displayed a dome-shaped distribution with depth with maximum density at intermediate depths. Red king crabs had a maximum density (86 crabs ha- 1) at 70 - 80 m while the maximum density of <b>Tanner</b> <b>crabs</b> (105 crabs ha- 1) was at 140 - 150 m of depth.

Recruitment time-series for the two stocks are not correlated. Process-related hypotheses are reviewed that explore likely sources of interannual variation in year-class strengths. The monotonic decline year-class strength of red king crabs through the late 1980 s is significantly correlated with barometric pressure averaged over the area of the Aleutian Low pressure region. However many variables may be correlated with this simple trend and so statistical evidence could not be developed for specific process mechanisms. On the other hand, year-class strength of <b>Tanner</b> <b>crabs</b> is not correlated with barometric pressure, but with wind intensity from the NE and SW quadrants during May-June. The wind changes, while ultimately caused by shifts of both intensity and position of the Aleutian Low, are likely to have differential implications for larval survival for the two species.

Management of sex-selective crab {{fisheries}} could {{be enhanced by}} improved understanding of the functional relationship between male harvest and female reproductive potential. This research advances knowledge of factors associated with variation in reproductive potential by characterizing factors influencing female sperm reserves for <b>Tanner</b> <b>crab,</b> identifying factors associated with variability in fecundity for female snow crab in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), and developing refined indices of egg (embryo) production and recruitment for snow crab that revealed a positive functional relationship {{that has not been}} previously described for this stock. Sperm reserves of female <b>Tanner</b> <b>crab</b> varied with mature female ontogeny, sex ratio, and harvest. Increasing exploitation rate is associated with decreased average sperm reserves of primipara (first reproductive cycle) while increased availability of large, sexually-dominant, adult males, was associated with increased cumulative sperm reserves for multipara (second or greater reproductive cycle) among <b>Tanner</b> <b>crab</b> stocks. A white-layer of fresh ejaculate in the spermathecae (sperm-storage organ) was a robust indicator of increased sperm reserves in both primiparous and multiparous females and is likely a useful tool for evaluating risk of sperm limitation in Chionoecetes. Fecundity of female snow crab in the EBS was influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Fecundity increased with increasing female size and decreased for older multipara likely due to senescence. Variability in fecundity-at-size was higher among multipara than primipara and this may be associated with contrasting mating dynamics, tempo of reproduction, maternal age, or environmental influences on maternal condition. Mating success may also influence fecundity of multiparous females; females with fresh ejaculate had higher fecundity (~ 10 %) than those that did not. Substantial embryo loss during brooding was not observed for snow crab, and embryo quality did not vary with female size or age relative to maturity. Refining indices of female reproductive potential with demographic and fecundity information resulted in reduced estimates of reproductive output. A positive functional relationship between reproductive potential and recruitment was detected at a lag of four years due to coherence between high reproductive output in the late 1980 s and strong recruitment in the early 1990 s.

40|$|AbstractTo {{quantify}} total {{fishing mortality}} {{it is necessary}} to incorporate mortality rates attributed to bycatch, including animals that are discarded and that interact with the gear without being caught. The Reflex Action Mortality Predictor (RAMP) approach has been increasingly used to determine bycatch mortality rates in fisheries. This methodology creates a RAMP that relates reflex impairment to probability of mortality. As the RAMP approach becomes more prevalent it becomes important to evaluate the efficacy of its application. We evaluated the flexibility of this methodology by creating a RAMP for <b>Tanner</b> <b>crab</b> (Chionoecetes bairdi) discarded from the groundfish bottom trawl fishery in the Gulf of Alaska and comparing it to a previously established RAMP for unobserved <b>Tanner</b> <b>crab</b> bycatch (encountered gear and remained on the seafloor) from the bottom trawl fishery in the Bering Sea. The two RAMPs and the overall mortality rates calculated using these predictors were comparable. However, we detected significant differences between RAMPs. While probabilities of mortality were similar between the two studies for crab with all or no reflexes missing, discarded crab with intermediate reflex impairment had lower mortality probabilities than those from the unobserved-bycatch study. Our results indicate that a RAMP may produce more accurate mortality estimates when applied to animals experiencing similar stressors as those evaluated to create the RAMP, through similar methodology...|$|R

In this paper, we determine the effects of long-term exposure to near-future levels of ocean acidification on the growth, condition, calcification, and survival of juvenile red king crabs, Paralithodes camtschaticus, and <b>Tanner</b> <b>crabs,</b> Chionoecetes bairdi. Juveniles were reared in individual containers for nearly 200 days in flowing control (pH 8. 0), pH 7. 8, and pH 7. 5 seawater at ambient temperatures (range 4. 4 - 11. 9 °C). In both species, survival decreased with pH, with 100 % mortality of red king crabs occurring after 95 days in pH 7. 5 water. Though the morphology of neither species was affected by acidification, both species grew slower in acidified water. At the end of the experiment, calcium concentration was measured in each crab and the dry mass and condition index of each crab were determined. Ocean acidification did not affect the calcium content of red king crab but did decrease the condition index, while it had the opposite effect on <b>Tanner</b> <b>crabs,</b> decreasing calcium content but leaving the condition index unchanged. This suggests that red king crab may be able to maintain calcification rates, but at a high energetic cost.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 The oceans absorb a large {{proportion}} of the carbon dioxide gas (CO₂) emitted into the atmosphere. This CO₂ changes the chemistry of seawater to make it more acidic, a phenomenon termed ocean acidification. Ocean acidification can have negative impacts on marine fauna, especially during early life stages, presenting a risk to ecosystems and fisheries. This research tested the effects of ocean acidification on the larval development of three crab species in Alaska: Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi), rock crab (Glebocarcinus oregonensis), and Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister). Experiments were undertaken to assess the effects of exposure to low-pH conditions (decrease of up to 0. 6 pH units from current levels, range of pH ~ 8. 1 to 7. 5) on survival, growth (morphometrics and mass), and carapace mineral composition of larval Tanner, rock, and Dungeness crabs. Results showed a decrease in survival as well as a small but nonsignificant decrease in size of <b>Tanner</b> <b>crabs.</b> There was a small and complex effect of pH on survival of Dungeness crabs. Rock crabs raised in low-pH conditions (pH 7. 5) had higher individual biomass than those raised in ambient conditions (pH 8. 1). There was no significant impact of pH on mineralization of any species. Therefore, low pH had a negative effect on development of <b>Tanner</b> <b>crabs,</b> a small effect on Dungeness larval survival and no discernible negative effect on rock crab larvae. Differences in response to ocean acidification may be related to pre-adaptation to variable pH conditions through lifestyle such that species that live in deeper, more stable waters (e. g., Tanner crab) are more vulnerable than species living in shallower, more variable waters (e. g., rock and Dungeness crabs). These observations suggest that ocean acidification will have negative impacts on Tanner and Dungeness crab larval survival with potential implications for recruitment to the adult population and consequently, for their fisheries...|$|E
