40|$|Most {{cheating}} {{in video}} games is possible due to information being accessible outside the intended frames {{of the game}} developer. The issue of protecting sensitive information have been handled in many areas outside of video games {{for a long time}} now. The goal {{of this paper is to}} review these information security solutions that are in use in more security concerned areas today and to potentially find transferable approaches that can help protect important and sensitive information in video games and that way help prevent cheating. In this paper the current threat and approaches of cheating is investigated to find the most commonly used security breaches. Then potential ways to increase the security of these areas are reviewed in order to find <b>transferable</b> <b>security</b> measures. A promising approach using hardware assisted virtualization is presented, that by using the virtualization hypervisor will handle encryption and decryption of application memory as well as preforming security checks for interaction with the host operating system, This can potentially provide a safe environment that can be used for video games while maintaining the required performance...|$|E

A new data set of capital raisings constructed from reports of prospectuses published in the financial press forms the basis for the conclusion that many firms used substantial injections of equity finance to augment internally generated sources of funds.

In 1985, the SociÃ©tÃ© EuropÃ©enne des Satellites (SES) was created, on the basis of a concession from the Luxembourgish state. The government gave the SES a state guarantee, in order to allow the financing of the Astra system of satellites. After having had some success in the domain of television broadcasts by satellite, the authorities tried to support audiovisual production. The law of 13 December 1988 introduced certificates of audiovisual investment, which gave their owners considerable tax allowances.

40|$|Undertakings for Collective Investment in <b>Transferable</b> <b>Securities</b> (UCITS) {{funds of}} hedge funds (FoHFs) are a fast-growing {{investment}} opportunity {{because of their}} distinctive characteristics with respect to other financial instruments. Constraints applied on UCITS FoHF investment selection can affect performance and risk and make these instruments different respect to other FoHFs. The hedge fund literature has thoroughly analyzed risk-adjusted performance (RAP) measures to determine {{the limits of the}} assumption of normality in evaluating such investment opportunities. While new RAP measures have been proposed to overcome these limits, no such empirical evidence exists for UCITS FoHFs. This paper evaluates the relevance of the choice of risk measure in selecting the best investment opportunities among a set of UCITS FoHFs for the period 2003 â€“ 2011. The results demonstrate that, even if the rankings according to different RAP measures are correlated, RAP measures that remove the assumption of a normal return distribution may increase the persistence of the results and investments selection process based on such measures may lead to better performance, even during the global financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|Index {{tracking}} aims at determining {{an optimal}} portfolio that replicates {{the performance of}} an index or benchmark by investing in {{a smaller number of}} constituents or assets.

The UCITS rules make the problem hard to be satisfactorily modeled and solved to optimality: no exact methods but only heuristics have been proposed so far. The aim of this paper is twofold.
