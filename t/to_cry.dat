40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effects of oxytocin administration on the response <b>to</b> infant <b>crying</b> in individuals with secure or insecure attachment representations as assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview. We measured feelings of irritation and the use of excessive force as indicated by grip strength using a handgrip dynamometer during exposure <b>to</b> infant <b>crying</b> in 42 women without children who were administered intranasal oxytocin or a placebo. In addition, amygdala responses <b>to</b> infant <b>crying</b> and control sounds were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The effects of oxytocin on reactivity <b>to</b> <b>crying</b> were moderated by attachment security. Oxytocin decreased the use of excessive handgrip force and amygdala reactivity in response <b>to</b> <b>crying</b> in individuals with insecure attachment representations. Our findings indicate that insecure individuals, who show emotional, behavioral, and neural hyperreactivity <b>to</b> <b>crying,</b> benefit the most from intranasal oxytocin.

5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E

5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E

40|$|All {{incidents}} of crying {{that occurred in}} a preschool setting were recorded along with the responses of other children and teachers. After pilot observations had been carried out for 3 hours at each of 20 preschool and day care centers, detailed observations were made at a single site, four hours per day, twice a week, from late fall to mid-spring. The 37 children under observation {{ranged in age from}} 28 to 48 months. In the main study, 290 crying episodes were recorded at the rate of 2. 1 per hour. Observations were coded in terms of causes of <b>crying,</b> peer resp;;Ases <b>to</b> <b>crying,</b> teacher responses <b>to</b> <b>crying,</b> and context. Each child was rated on sibling status, length of time at the center, number of friends, and verbal clarity and fluency. Findings indicate that crying was an infrequent phenomenon that was responded to infrequently by peers. Responding <b>to</b> <b>crying</b> behavior over two-thirds of the time, teachars were much more likely <b>to</b> console a <b>crying</b> girl than a crying boy and tended to respond more critically <b>to</b> a boy <b>crier</b> than <b>to</b> a girl <b>crier.</b> When they responded, children responded like their teachers. Two-thirds of crying episodes were peer-related; positive, prosocial responses were more likely to occur when a child was crying alone than when interacting with a peer.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

40|$|Background: Oxytocin {{facilitates}} parental caregiving and mother-infant bonding {{and might}} be involved in responses <b>to</b> infant <b>crying.</b> Infant crying provides information about the physical status and mood of the infant and elicits parental proximity and caregiving. Oxytocin might modulate the activation of brain structures involved {{in the perception of}} cry sounds-specifically the insula, the amygdala, and the thalamocingulate circuit-and thereby affect responsiveness <b>to</b> infant <b>crying.</b> Method: In a randomized controlled trial we investigated the influence of intranasally administered oxytocin on neural responses <b>to</b> infant <b>crying</b> with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Blood oxygenation level-dependent responses <b>to</b> infant <b>crying</b> were measured in 21 women who were administered oxytocin and 21 women who were administered a placebo. Results: Induced oxytocin levels reduced, experimentally, activation in the amygdala and increased activation in the insula and inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that oxytocin promotes responsiveness <b>to</b> infant <b>crying</b> by reducing activation in the neural circuitry for anxiety and aversion and increasing activation in regions involved in empathy...|$|R
5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
