5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|E
5|$|Dewes and Len Hutton {{opened for}} England, {{a move that}} {{attracted}} criticism of Yardley for exposing the debutant Dewes to the new ball bowling of Lindwall and Keith Miller. After Hutton opened the scoring with a single from the second ball of the day, Dewes was on strike. The single had almost turned into a five when Sam Loxton fired in a wide return, but Sid Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Dewes took a single from the opening over—bowled by Lindwall—and thus faced {{the start of the}} second over, which was delivered by Miller. Dewes had been troubled by Miller in the past. During the Victory Tests in 1945, Miller had repeatedly dismissed the batsman, and during a match for Cambridge University against the Australians earlier in the tour, Dewes had used <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> pad his torso against Miller's short balls. During his short innings, Dewes was also visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still.|$|E
25|$|Before eating, most dining places provide {{either a}} {{hot or cold}} towel or a plastic-wrapped wet napkin (o-shibori). This is for {{cleaning}} hands before eating (and not after). It is rude {{to use them to}} wash the face or any part of the body other than the hands, though some Japanese men use their o-shibori to wipe their faces in less formal places. Accept o-shibori with both hands when handed the towel by a server. When finished, fold or roll up the oshibori and place it on the table. It is impolite to use o-shibori <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> wipe any spills on the table.|$|E

25|$|However one {{physical}} site allowed {{cost savings}} {{with some of}} the facilities shared; St. Bernard's oil burning boilers for instance were enlarged in number from 4 to 6 to provide hot water and radiator heating to both hospitals, and the existing laundry facilities on the St. Bernard's site, near the boilers, provided bed linen and <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> both hospitals. But the new Ealing hospital building included a larger mortuary allowing the outdated St. Bernard's mortuary to close. Both hospitals retained separate Kitchens, Maintenance, Pharmacy, Telephone exchange and portering services, whilst separate management require separate Finance, Human Resources, and later IT departments.|$|E
25|$|If a {{fluorescent}} lamp is broken, {{a very small}} amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment. About 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor, especially on lamps that are {{near the end of}} their life. The broken glass is usually considered a greater hazard than the small amount of spilled mercury. The EPA recommends airing out the location of {{a fluorescent}} tube break and using wet paper <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> help pick up the broken glass and fine particles. Any glass and used towels should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag. Vacuum cleaners can cause the particles to become airborne, and should not be used.|$|E
500|$|The Terrible Towel is {{traditionally}} {{known as the}} first [...] "rally towel"; its popularity has spawned similar traditions for other teams. Fans of the Minnesota Twins cheer {{the team with the}} [...] "Homer Hanky" [...] during the playoffs. The Philadelphia Phillies have distributed white <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> fans during home games. During a 2006 playoff game against the Steelers, the Indianapolis Colts handed out blue <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> rally fans, however, Pittsburgh {{went on to win the}} game. In a 2000 preseason game, played in Mexico City, many fans that filled the 100,000 seat Aztec Stadium waved towels. Cope, glad that the Allegheny Valley School would receive a sizable donation from the proceeds, was later disappointed to learn the towels waved by the fans were [...] "knockoffs" [...] made by local artists, and therefore no proceeds would go to the school. In 2008, the NFL approved a white towel entitled the Trophy Towel, which will be sold to fans and given to the winning team of Super Bowl XLIII. Members of the Steelers criticized the idea, broadcaster Bill Hillgrove—who worked with Cope—called the idea [...] "a cheap imitation." [...] Steelers player Aaron Smith stated, [...] "It started here, so why would anyone else want to have a towel? Why not kazoos?" [...] During the 2010 Memorial Cup the host committee made up 8,000 yellow <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> represent the host team, the Brandon Wheat Kings, who played the Moncton Wildcats. Many fans brought the towels back for games after that. [...] Waving white rally towels has the unfortunate distinction of resembling surrender by waving a white flag (citation needed).|$|E

500|$|Apparently, Lugovoy and Kovtun did {{not fully}} realize they were {{handling}} a radioactive poison. Journalist Luke Harding described their behaviour as [...] "idiotic, verging on suicidal"; while handling a leaky container, they stored it in their hotel rooms, used ordinary <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> clean up leaks, and eventually disposed of the poison in the toilet. On 17 October, perhaps realizing they contaminated their rooms, they prematurely checked out, moved to another hotel, and left London the next day.|$|E
500|$|Cope {{played a}} large role in the {{invention}} of the Terrible Towel. Needing a way to excite the fans during a 1975 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts, Cope urged fans to take yellow dish <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> the game and wave them throughout. Originally, Cope wanted to sell rubber Jack Lambert masks, but realizing the high costs for the masks, opted for the inexpensive option for the Terrible Towel. The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and [...] "is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team".|$|E
500|$|Weinberg rose {{to success}} as the drummer for Springsteen's E Street Band, as his {{powerful}} yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands is {{that not only is}} Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's mind. You can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E

500|$|When the Canucks {{returned}} home, {{they were}} greeted by fans at the airport waving towels {{in support of the}} team. During game three, fans waved <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> show support for the Canucks. Former professional football player, wrestler, and five time world belly flop champion Butts Giraud got permission from the team to start selling towels with the phrase [...] "Canucks Take no Survivors". [...] He initially had 5,000 of them made at $1 apiece and sold 1,000 of them right away, proceeds going to charity. [...] Giraud would sell 30,000 towels personally, the proceeds for charity amounted to $23,000. Vancouver won game three 4–3 {{to take the lead in}} the series. For game four there were more fans waving towels as the Canucks won again 5–3. Vancouver won game five in Chicago and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were swept by the New York Islanders.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons {{decide to}} investigate. They {{go to the}} old quarry where they meet Chief Wiggum, who comes with them. Marge uses Burly paper <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> drain {{the water from the}} quarry. Then, they find the {{skeleton}} and go into the inlet pipe to see where the body came from. They find that the pipe leads to a ladder which, in turn, leads to Mr. Burns's office. They confront him about the body, but he insists he did not murder anyone. He tells them that the dead man is Smithers' father, Waylon Smithers Sr. He shows an old surveillance tape, filmed during the imminent meltdown in which Smithers' father goes into an unstable reactor core to prevent the meltdown. He succeeds in saving the city, but he dies in the process due to exposure to large amounts of radiation. Burns tells them that he kept the truth from Waylon Jr.; Smithers then enters the room, having heard the entire story. Burns apologizes to him, saying he wanted to spare him from telling the story about his father's real death. However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier. Declaring the case of the haunted quarry solved, Homer stores the skull in his [...] "Memories" [...] box, despite Marge's insistence to give it to Smithers.|$|E

60|$|In the {{assistant}} engineer's bungalow Spurstow and Hummil smoked the pipe of silence together, each narrowly watching the other. The {{capacity of a}} bachelor's establishment is as elastic as its arrangements are simple.

60|$|But, in a {{fortnight}} more, this great Question of the Trial, while the fit Committee is assiduously but silently working on it, receives an unexpected stimulus. Our readers remember poor Louis's turn for smithwork: how, in old happier days, a certain Sieur Gamain of Versailles was wont to come over, and instruct him in lock-making;--often scolding him, they say for his numbness. By whom, nevertheless, the royal Apprentice had learned {{something of that}} craft. Hapless Apprentice; perfidious Master-Smith! For now, on this 20th of November 1792, dingy Smith Gamain comes over to the Paris Municipality, over to Minister Roland, with hints that he, Smith Gamain, knows a thing; that, in May last, when traitorous Correspondence was so brisk, he and the royal Apprentice fabricated an 'Iron Press, Armoire de Fer,' cunningly inserting the same in a wall of the royal chamber in the Tuileries; invisible under the wainscot; where doubtless it still sticks! Perfidious Gamain, attended by the proper Authorities, finds the wainscot panel which none else can find; wrenches it up; discloses the Iron Press,--full of Letters and Papers! Roland clutches them out; conveys them over in <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> the fit assiduous Committee, which sits hard by. In towels, we say, and without notarial inventory; an oversight {{on the part of}} Roland.|$|E
60|$|We rise when we {{have had}} sleep enough--any time you like between seven and ten. If I happen to be on deck first, I begin by hearing {{the news of the}} weather and the wind, from Sam, Dick, or Bob at the helm. Soon the face of Mr. Migott, rosy with recent snoring, rises from the cabin, and his body follows it slowly, clad in the blue Jersey frock which he {{persists}} in wearing night and day--in the heat of noon as in the cool of evening. He cannot be prevailed upon to give any reason for his violent attachment to this garment--only wagging his head and smiling mysteriously when we ask why, sleeping or waking, he never parts with it. Well, being up, the next thing is to make the toilette. We keep our fresh water, for minor ablutions, in an old wine cask from Bristol. The colour of the liquid is a tawny yellow: it is, in fact, weak sherry and water. For the major ablutions, we have the ship's bucket and the sea, and a good stock of rough <b>towels</b> <b>to</b> finish with. The next thing is breakfast on deck. When we can catch fish (which is very seldom, though we are well provided with lines and bait) we fall upon the spoil immediately. At other times we range through our sea stores, eating anything we like, cooked anyhow we like. After breakfast we have two words to say to our box of peaches, nectarines, and grapes, from the hospitable country-house. Then the bedding is brought up to air; the deck is cleaned; the breakfast things are taken away; the pipes, cigars, and French novels are produced from the cabin; Mr. Migott coils himself up {{in a corner of the}} cockpit, and I perch upon the taffrail; and the studies of the morning begin. They end invariably in small-talk, beer, and sleep. So the time slips away cosily till it is necessary to think about dinner.|$|E
