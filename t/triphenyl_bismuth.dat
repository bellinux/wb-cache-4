40|$|The water {{sorption}} and desorption {{characteristics of}} <b>triphenyl</b> <b>bismuth</b> (TPB) -cements were studied. The radiopacity of TPB was evaluated {{in order to}} assess its contrast in comparison to BaSO 4 -containing cements. It was observed that TPB-cements absorb/ desorp less water than BaSO 4 cements (BS) due to the hydrophobic nature of TPB. It was shown that the addition of TPB to acrylic cements results in the formation of homogeneous system {{as a result of its}} solubility in MMA...|$|E
40|$|Radiopaque cement {{containing}} {{barium sulfate}} causes significantly more bone resorption in vivo and in vitro than radiolucent cement. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the osteolytic potential of an alternative radiopaque agent, <b>triphenyl</b> <b>bismuth</b> (TPB). Bone cement particles containing various concentration of TPB (15 and 25 wt %) prepared by two methods, blending and dissolution, were added to monocytes in a bone resorption assay and the extent of lacunar resorption on dentine slices was determined. The results clearly show that cement particles containing TPB cause less bone resorption than cement particles containing barium sulfate. In addition, our results suggest that TPB prepared by dissolution in bone cement induces less osteolytic response than TPB-cement prepared by blending. The osteolysis in response to bone cement wear particles may therefore be reduced with TPB prepared using the blending technique...|$|E
40|$|Silica {{core-shell}} nanoparticles {{of about}} 60 – 120 nm with a closed outer layer of bismuth or molybdenum oxide of 1 – 10 nm were synthesized by an integrated chemical vapor synthesis/chemical vapor deposition process at atmospheric pressure. Film growth rates and activation energies {{were derived from}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for a deposition process based on molybdenum hexacarbonyl and <b>triphenyl</b> <b>bismuth</b> as respective coating precursors. Respective activation energies of 123 ± 10 and 155 ± 10 kJ/mol are in good agreement with the literature and support a deposition mechanism based on surface-induced removal of the precursor ligands. Clean substrate surfaces are thus prerequisite for conformal coatings. Integrated aerosol processes are solvent-free and intrinsically clean. In contrast, commercial silica substrate particles were found to suffer from organic residues which hinder shell formation, and require an additional calcination step to clean the surface prior to coating. Dual layer core-shell structures with molybdenum oxide on bismuth oxide were synthesized with two coating reactors in series and showed similar film growth rates...|$|E
40|$|Bismuth oxide {{thin films}} are of great {{interest}} due to their significant band gap, high refractive index, and dielectric permittivity, as well as marked photoconductivity and photoluminescence. [1] These properties make Bi 2 O 3 films well suited for many applications such as microelectronics,[2] sensor technology,[3] optical coatings,[4] and ceramic glass manufacturing. [5] In this work, we report the synthesis of Bi 2 O 3 films on alumina particles using fluidized bed (FB) CVD under atmospheric pressure. <b>Bismuth</b> <b>triphenyl</b> (Bi(Ph) 3) {{was used as a}} metal-organic (MO) CVD precursor...|$|R
40|$|Iron-catalyzed, gas-phase {{disproportionation}} {{of carbon}} monoxide under high pressures is known to produce single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) in high yields. Small amounts of nontubular nanocarbons and iron encapsulated-graphitic shelled nanoparticles are produced concomitantly. Differences in the oxidation kinetics among the SWNT, nontubular carbon, and iron core-graphitic shell nanoparticles have been exploited {{as a tool for}} the quantitative determination of high-molecular-weight nontubular, carbon products. The nontubular carbon materials were eliminated by selective oxidation wherein the raw material was subjected to increasing oxidation thresholds followed by acid leaching in an aqueous or gas-solid reaction. Relative concentrations of nontubular nanocarbons in differentially oxidized samples were determined employing laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) with C 60 and <b>bismuth</b> <b>triphenyl</b> as internal markers. The identity of the nontubular carbon was examined by nondestructive extraction through fluorination in a gas-solid reaction followed by LDI-MS and electron microscopic and polarized Raman spectroscopies. The extracted nontubular carbon was found to be comprised predominantly of large, closed-shell carbon structures spanning the range of C 120 to C 400...|$|R
40|$|We {{synthesize}} {{a series}} of polyvinylcarbazole monoliths containing varying loadings of <b>triphenyl</b> <b>bismuth</b> as a high-Z dopant and varying fluors, either organic or organometallic, in order to study their use as scintillators capable of gamma ray spectroscopy. A trend of increasing bismuth loading resulting in a better-resolved photopeak is observed. For PVK parts with no fluor or a standard organic fluor, diphenylanthracene, increasing bismuth loading results in decreasing light yield while with samples 1 or 3 % by weight of the spin-orbit coupling organometallic fluor FIrpic, which emits light from both singlet and triple excitons, show increasing light yield with increasing bismuth loading. Our best performing PVK/ BiPh{sub 3 }/FIrpic scintillator with 40 wt % BiPh 3 and 3 wt % FIrpic has an emission maximum of 500 nm, a light yield of {approx} 30, 000 photons/MeV, and energy resolution better than 7 % FWHM at 662 keV. Replacing the Ir complex with an equal weight of diphenylanthracene produces a sample with a light yield of {approx} 6, 000 photons/MeV, with an emission maximum at 420 nm and energy resolution of 9 % at 662 keV. Transmission electron microscopy {{studies show that the}} BiPh{sub 3 } forms small clusters of approximately 5 nm diameter...|$|E
40|$|Total joint {{replacement}} is {{the most}} successful method of treating end-stage arthritis. It significantly improves {{the quality of life}} and the functional capability of patients suffering from arthritis. Currently an estimated 40, 000 total joint arthroplasties are performed each year in the United Kingdom, and over 42 % of these are performed in patients younger than 65 years. Poly(methylmethacrylate) bone cement is used to fill the space between the bone and the prosthesis in joint replacements and thus forms a mechanical bond between the two surfaces. The cement layer transfers the load from the prosthesis to the bone and increases the load bearing capacity of the implant-cement-bone system. Surgeons require bone cement to be radiopaque on radiographs in order to monitor the position of the implant after a joint replacement surgery. Therefore heavy metal salts such as barium sulphate and zirconium dioxide are added to bone cement to impart such radiopacity. The addition of these radiopacifiers, however, degrades the mechanical properties of the bone cement {{due to the lack of}} chemical bonding between the radiopacifier and the polymer matrix. Barium sulphate is known to adversely affect the mechanical strength and fracture toughness of bone cement. Various studies have also shown that barium sulphate and zirconium dioxide may contribute to the pathological bone resorption of aseptic loosening by enhancing macrophage-osteoclast differentiation. In this study an organo-bismuth compound, <b>triphenyl</b> <b>bismuth</b> (TPB) has been investigated as a potential radiopaque alternative to barium sulphate in bone cements. The inclusion of TPB has been shown to improve the mechanical properties of bone cement including fracture toughness. Furthermore, it has also been shown to cause less bone resorption, which is usually associated with aseptic loosening in joint replacement.

40|$|The {{reaction}} between <b>triphenyl</b> <b>bismuth</b> and {{salicylic acid}} in refluxing toluene proceeds via an acid hydrolysis pathway {{to produce a}} yellow complex analyzing as bismuth (III) salicylate [...] -[Bi(Hsal) 3]n [...] -in quantitative yield. The composition of the complex is critically affected by the ratio of bismuth to salicylic acid that is employed in the reaction mixture. The material produced from a 1 : 3 ratio of bismuth to salicylic acid being essentially insoluble, while {{the product of a}} 1 : 20 ratio of bismuth:salicylic acid is soluble {{in a wide range of}} solvents including hot toluene. Bismuth (III) salicylate is a useful synthon for the formation of heterobimetallic coordination complexes. The material reacts readily with the transition metal alkoxides Ti(OiPr) 4, Nb(OEt) 5 and Ta(OEt) 5 to produce bimetallic compounds by an alcohol exchange pathway. The reactivity of the bismuth salicylate is mediated by the acidity of the phenolic oxygen on the salicylate ligand. The composition of the complexes produced in this manner are affected by the stoichiometry of the reagents, the concentration of water in the reaction mixture, the solvent polarity and the pH of the system and, most importantly, the identity of the transition metal species. Heterobimetallic complexes can also be produced by direct Lewis acid-base adduct formation between bismuth (III) salicylate and metal complexes. The complexes produced in this manner have lower nuclearity than the compounds derived from the alkoxide-based routes, but better control over the ultimate stoichiometry of the system is obtained. The heterobimetallic complexes produced through both reaction pathways smoothly decompose to produce crystalline binary oxide materials. In general, the conditions required to achieve decomposition and crystallization of the molecular precursors are significantly reduced compared to traditional solid-state syntheses. The properties of the oxides produced from the molecular precursors including crystallinity, morphology and phases present are strongly influenced by the conditions of decomposition...|$|E
40|$|Butacene® (trademark by SNPE, France) with ferrocenyl groups {{chemically}} {{bonded to}} HTPB backbone leads to high burning rates (rb > 20 mm/s at 7 MPa) in AP-Al based solid composite rocket propellant (SCRP) formulations {{by keeping the}} pressure exponent (n) lower than 0. 5. Moreover, one can pre-serve the characteristics (kneading process, mechanical properties, pot-life) of conventional HTPB binder formulations together with less sensitivity regarding formation of pyrophoric iron on inner surfaces of the propellant grain. The behavior of Butacene formulations during accelerated aging is analyzed mainly by DMA and additional results are shared with the current study. The thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) is used to characterize SCRP for thermal expansion. But TMA {{can be used in}} part complementary to DMA as it is also sensitive to molecular mobility of the different fractions in highly filled elastomeric network. Butacene preserved insensitivity compared to a formulation with HTPB and using other materials as burning catalyst as CatoceneTM or iron oxide. The interpretation of SCRP cure kinetics is important {{in order to get the}} final product free of flaws, i. e., cracks, fissures, voids, and further on interphases with adequate mechanical properties. An important point is to be able to define final point of curing and residual post-curing time because the latter interferes with the accelerated aging and would distort the estimation of in-service time. Thus analysis of rheological and thermal cure kinetics during the evolution of liquid to gel to solid phase is investigated. The curing characteristics of such a system can be modelled in several ways in terms of viscosity build-up w. r. t. time, thermally with DSC via Kissinger method, and in Heat Flow Calorimeter (HFC) and Pressure Curing Cells (PCC). Current work comprise cure modelling in PCC with different SCRP formulations, which allows the investigation of the effect of curing catalyst TPB (<b>triphenyl</b> <b>bismuth),</b> reactivity of formulations containing HTPB and Butacene® versus the formulation based on HTPB binder alone...|$|E
