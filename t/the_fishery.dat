5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. <b>The</b> <b>fishery</b> utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years old, with 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E

5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits. Shark finning is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common thresher fishery is {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common thresher fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through <b>the</b> <b>Fishery</b> Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings.

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} commercial fisheries {{into the deep}} sea has raised concerns about the vulnerability of this and other deepwater shark species to overfishing, as these sharks have slow growth and reproductive rates. This is exemplified by the rapid stock depletion and collapse of the Azores kitefin shark fishery. This targeted fishery {{began in the early}} 1970s for the production of liver oil. In the early 1980s, the fishing fleet was enlarged with the addition of industrial vessels equipped with demersal gillnets, resulting in a fishery peak in 1984 of 937 tons landed. After 1991, kitefin shark catches declined precipitously to under 15 tons annually which, along with a drop in the global price of liver oil, led to <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> becoming unprofitable {{by the end of the}} decade.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fishery</b> {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. <b>The</b> <b>fishery</b> {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed {{to sit at the}} fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level.

5|$|Early European (primarily from England, Ireland and France) {{settlement}} in Newfoundland {{was confined to}} the coast. The rich cod fishery on the Grand Banks and along {{the shore of the}} island was the primary reason for these settlements. The rugged shoreline provided many small, but isolated, harbors (outports) from which to conduct <b>the</b> <b>fishery.</b> The Avalon Peninsula was, and is, the most populous part of the island, and as such had the best developed system of early roads and trails. Transportation between communities on other parts of the coast, especially the south coast between Fortune Bay and Port aux Basques, was exclusively by boat. Almost all communities are now accessible by roads which are part of the provincial road system. The now-defunct Newfoundland Railway, built {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century, and the development of the lead, zinc and copper mine at Buchans and the paper mill in Grand Falls in the early 20th century marked the beginning of the settlement of the interior of the island. Despite these developments the majority of the population is still found along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and {{has been}} {{displayed}} in public aquariums. It is frequently caught by recreational anglers from shore or ski-boats; it is edible but rarely eaten. Small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal longline fishery targeting the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) in the Gansbaai and False Bay region. The meat from sharks caught in <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> is either made into biltong or jerky and sold locally, or exported fresh or frozen to Italy and Taiwan. Although in South Africa the sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species and thus cannot be harvested commercially, it is often mistaken for the common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) by fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sharptooth houndshark as Near Threatened. This species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure, due to its restricted range, slow growth rate, and low fecundity. The fact that most sharks caught by fishers are immature is an additional source of concern.|$|E

40|$|In most of {{the coastal}} countries, <b>the</b> <b>fisheries</b> enable to satisfy {{multiple}} socio-economic needs such as food safety, public receipts, employment and so on.

5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of <b>the</b> <b>fishery.</b> Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E

Repairs were made from 1651 onwards, and new accommodation was constructed for the fort's gunners. After an invasion scare in 1655, Mersea was temporarily used to imprison Royalists suspected of planning an insurgency against Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth government. The fort was then demobilised by Cromwell as part of his efforts to reduce defence costs; Burrell was ordered to dismantle the fort but the order was never carried out, partially because of the practical difficulties and because of opposition from the owner of the land.
