40|$|This is an {{introduction}} to taboo expressions in ASL. Several word-formation processes are exploited in coining ASL taboo-terms, most also exploited by non-taboo <b>terms.</b> Further, ASL <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> are both entrenched and clever (sometimes humorous). This is expected if the entrenchment vs. evanescence of slang and <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> in sign languages {{is affected by the}} same (or similar) factors relevant to slang and <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> in spoken languages. With regard to syntax, <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> appear isolated or embedded in larger structures as predicates or referential NPs. They rarely appear as modifiers, unlike in English. Instead, sometimes a sentence with no <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> is followed by an explicitly sexual or otherwise taboo sentence emphasizing it. Alternatively, to convey vulgarity or emphasis, one will modulate a sign 2 ̆ 7 s movement and employ appropriate affective nonmanuals. English and ASL exploit the same mechanisms for emotionally-charged language—taboo terms, modulation of phonetic properties, and facial expressions—but to differing degrees. Since the manual articulators are slower than spoken language articulators, ASL favors the use of nonmanuals, which do not lengthen the duration of an ASL sentence, allowing affective information to be efficiently integrated into the message...|$|R

In this paper we examine a number of predicates in American Sign Language that have recently been formed from what were, historically, taboo-terms, {{as well as one}} more recently coined mildly taboo-term, and we show that they, likewise, behave in unusual ways morphologically and syntactically. We look at conversion from noun to verb that restricts the movement of the resultant verb to that typically associated with continuative aspect, at a non-presentational predicate that takes a sentential subject, at a verb that agrees with something properly within its sentential object, at a verb that takes an adverbial clause following it, and at a verb string that involves neither conjoining nor embedding. Thus, while <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> have been severely understudied in sign languages, their analysis offers new insights on linguistic structure.

40|$|Currently, {{scholarship}} {{in the field}} of linguistic taboo concentrates on the history of cursing, the usage of cursing in society, methodologies for collecting data on cursing, and the history and use of particular terms. However to date, there has been no examination of the semantic shifts of <b>taboo</b> <b>terms,</b> nor has there been any analyses {{of the history of the}} semantic fields of which these terms have membership, and so this study serves as a model for analyzing <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> according to etymological and semantic field history. This analysis reveals the interplay between language, culture, and taboo terminology because it demonstrates that as attitudes in society change, language changes, and thus results in semantic shifts of meaning and taboo status. ^ This thesis is structured in three main chapters: (1) Introduction, describing the purpose, analyzing the available literature on the topic, and defining the methodology; (2) Data, tracing the history of the semantic field of excrement from Old English to Present-Day English, with particular attention to shit; (3) Discussion, Conclusions, and Future Research. ...|$|R

40|$|The two English constructions {{exemplified}} in Let 2 ̆ 7 s {{get the hell}} out of here (type G) and They beat the hell out of him (type B) differ both syntactically and semantically, but in both the taboo expression has the force of an intensifier. History (through a corpus investigation) reveals that the B-construction started as a literal exorcism (beat the devil out of someone), where the hell substituted for the devil, and semantic bleaching ultimately made the literal sense give way to simple emphasis, with any <b>taboo</b> <b>term</b> jumping in. The G-construction may have developed simultaneously, always as an intensifier [...] or, perhaps, later, on analogy with B. Our analysis suggests that the use of taboo terms as intensifies spread from wh-constructions to these constructions and, finally, to degree intensifier constructions. These two uses of taboo terms as intensifies are best characterized in terms of constructions and thus offer evidence against theories lacking any notion of constructions as basic building blocks. Further, they give us information about language change: a pragmatically unified but semantically disparate class of expressions (namely, taboo terms) can extend its distribution in parallel...|$|E

40|$|Tabooed {{language}} for speakers {{from around the}} world is generally understood to refer to those lexical items and expressions considered to be unlucky, indecent, immoral, obscene, etc. because saying them would violate certain sociocultural norms; but, it is for this very reason that some speakers do indeed utter them. As for the Cantonese language, this study has investigated a set of linguistic terms that its speakers have also tabooed as being inauspicious, profane, offensive, etc. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to and collected through contacts from 72 Cantonese speakers aged 16 to 64, with the objectives to explore speakers’ use of and attitudes towards tabooed lexical items by asking them questions on frequency of and reasons for using the terms, how acceptable and <b>tabooed</b> the <b>terms</b> are perceived to be and their habit of using the Internet. Tables of figures were constructed to consolidate speakers’ responses to the 14 <b>tabooed</b> linguistic <b>terms.</b> Survey results primarily show that often-said <b>tabooed</b> <b>terms</b> are more readily acceptable to speakers, and that the more <b>tabooed</b> the <b>terms</b> are, the lower their acceptability would be, but lower acceptability does not necessarily mean being unacceptable, and that the Internet tends to facilitate use of tabooed language among young speakers. Based on its findings, the study has concluded that every tabooed lexical item has a history and development of its own; and that change of speakers’ attitudes towards the types of words tabooed over time may cause changes in tabooed Cantonese lexicon which is also likely to be impacted by use of the Internet, especially among young speakers who are often at the leading edge of linguistic change. This study was conducted with a view to reveal some especially interesting but quite complex aspects of language and the opportunities for further theoretical progress in sociolinguistic research. published_or_final_versionLinguisticsMasterMaster of Art...|$|R

Bilingual speakers report that <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> and emotional phrases generate a stronger emotional response when heard or spoken {{in their first}} language. This suggests that the basic emotion-memory will be stronger for words presented in a first language. Turkish-English bilinguals performed a deep processing task (emotion intensity rating) or shallow processing task (counting letter features) and two additional deep processing tasks (translation and word association) on five categories of words (taboo words, reprimands, positive words, negative words, and neutral words), followed by a surprise recall task. Reprimands had the highest recall in English (L 2), which may be a novelty effect. If reprimands are set aside, then overall emotion-memory effects were similar in the two languages, with taboo words having the highest recall, followed by positive words. Negative words had no recall advantage over neutral words, an unexpected finding. Results indicate that emotional attributes of words are equally available to boost memory in a first and second language in both shallow and deep processing tasks, athough some task-specific effects did occur.

The research focuses on adult animation, specifically North American primetime television series, as manifestations of a social need to violate and thereby interrogate aspects of contemporary hetero-normative conformity in terms of identity and representation. A thematic analysis of four animated television series, namely Family Guy, Queer Duck, Drawn Together, and Rick & Steve, focuses on the texts themselves and various metatexts that surround these series. The analysis focuses specifically on expressions and manifestations of gay sexuality and sexual taboos and how these are articulated within the animated diegesis. The findings reveal the mutuality between the plasticity of animation, which lends itself to shaping physical representations of reality, and the complex social processes of non-violent cathartic ideological expressions that redefine sociopolitical boundaries. The argument contextualizes the changing face of sexuality and the limits of sexual <b>taboo</b> in <b>terms</b> of current contestations and acceptability and the relationship to animation. Contemporary animation both represents this social performance of transgression and is itself a transgressive product disrupting accepted conventions...|$|R

5000|$|After {{a number}} of years, a major crisis, called the Minorit Push, caused the Kadazan-Dusun to {{completely}} {{moved out of the}} site. The driving force behind the movement out and dispersal of the Kadazan-Dusun from Nunuk Ragang was said to be the Minorits, legendary tiny spiritual beings, emerging out of the ground to enforce their practice of infanticide. This exodus and dispersal led to the peopling of each territory in North Borneo. Each territory peopled had its own particular attraction or pull for peopling such as for example the Minkokook Pull for the Tambunan Plain and the Gomala Pull for the Kundasang/Bundu Tuhan Highland. It is not known why the ancestors were unable to fend off the Minorits, but in light of the Kadazan-Dusun love of the practice of riddling, and couching of <b>taboo</b> <b>terms</b> in alternative words and phrases, the legend of the Minorits is most likely a composite narratives of several natural phenomena and man-made activities, which evolved overtime into this reason for moving out of Nunuk Ragang. The most likely candidates are the smallpox and collapse of the soil fertility resulting from the advent of invasive lallang grasses. In this connection, the word [...] "minorit" [...] merit explanation. According to research conducted by I.H.N.Evans, the word minorit is used by Dusun in two phrases i.e. [...] "minorit O' paka" [...] referring to the vast sea of lalang invasively growing at newly cleared forest, as visible in Tempasuk and Matunggong. Another use of the word is in the phrase [...] "minorit O' lasu" [...] referring to skin disease with spots of the same size spread all over the body. The Minorit push can therefore be attributed to either the degradation of the land at Nunuk Ragang due to fertility loss as the grass species, lallang grass invades the land after forest clearing or the advent of smallpox epidemic among the people. The Smallpox pandemic which began in 1588 AD in Europe, decimated up to a third of the population. The population at Nunuk Ragang in that year was just about 180 individuals. The Kadazan-Dusun race would not have emerged to become a people if the ancestors had not moved out and dispersed. The people of Nunuk Ragang never had the opportunity to avail of the practice of Variolation (also known as inoculation) even though this method of prevention of the smallpox was first invented in China around 1500. Nunuk Ragang, an ideal site at the confluence of the Liwagu Kogibangan and Liwagu Kawanan and draining out into the Sulu Sea via the Labuk River had most of the ingredients for the emergence of a Kadazan-Dusun River Civilization. Unfortunately the dispersal of the Kadazan-Dusun contributed towards the failure of the race to rise above culture to achieve the status of a civilization. The word Liwagu derives from the Kadazan-Dusun phrase [...] "muli wagu" [...] meaning [...] "return home again". The male ancestors was never able to return to their China homeland. Cut off from their heritage, the descendants made the best use of the environment to which they were born into, thus giving birth to the unique Kadazan-Dusun culture. Present day Kadazan-Dusun leaders suggest that representatives of each sub-ethnic tribes under the Kadazan-Dusun race conduct an annual [...] "muli wagu"/homecoming to Nunuk Ragang as added tourism product to develop their common home.|$|R
40|$|Taboo {{is deeply}} woven into every culture and society, which is {{obviously}} reflected in vocabulary. Indeed, taboo keeps language users from avoiding the forbidden concept and compels them to preserve or violate it, {{which leads to}} endless series of cross varietal synonyms for forbidden concepts. In this process, though metaphor stands out as a potent source for euphemistic and dysphemistic reference, the analysis of conceptual metaphor in the Lakoffian tradition as a X-phemistic device has not been dealt with in depth so far. In this regard, the main aim {{of this paper is}} twofold: to gain an insight into the process of metaphorical X-phemistic lexical replacements triggered by taboo and explore the role the process of lexicalization of metaphorical units plays in sex and death-related X-phemistic vocabulary. The analysis undertaken demonstrates that whereas lexicalized metaphorical units are deprived of their capacity to conceptualize the <b>taboo</b> in particular <b>terms,</b> both semi-lexicalized and creative metaphors suit the purpose of euphemism and dysphemism by conceptualizing a taboo topic within a conceptual network, which accounts for the X-phemistic function of metaphorical items...|$|R

40|$|The {{studies of}} {{differences}} in language used by males and females appear mainly to have {{been focused on the}} spoken word and rarely on writing. This paper examines some linguistic differences that exist in male and female writing styles of Arabic novels. Some classes of lexical and syntactic features that identify the author’s gender are specified. The paper finds significant differences in the frequent use of some features such as colour, tag questions, verb vs. noun in initiating paragraphs, slang, <b>taboo</b> and euphemistic <b>terms.</b> In particular, males tend to use many more nouns in initial paragraphs compared to females who tend to use fewer of this category. Females are more conservative in using sex-related words whether implicitly or explicitly.
