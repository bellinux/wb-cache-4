5|$|According to Muslim biographies, Muhammed, having {{received}} intelligence that Byzantine forces were concentrating in northern Arabia with alleged intentions of invading Arabia, led a Muslim army north to Tabouk in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia, {{with the intention}} of pre-emptively engaging the Byzantine army; the news, however, proved to be false. Though it was not a battle in the typical sense, nevertheless the event represented the first Arab attack on the Byzantines. It did not, however, lead immediately <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> confrontation.|$|E

After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the brain to swell.|$|E

50|$|Though a {{paramilitary}} is not <b>a</b> <b>military</b> force, it {{is usually}} equivalent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military's</b> light infantry force in terms of intensity, firepower, and organizational structure. A paramilitary may also commonly fall {{under the command of}} <b>a</b> <b>military,</b> even despite not being part of the <b>military</b> or play <b>an</b> assisting role for the military in times of war.|$|R

5|$|Because he went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> school, {{attended}} some college, and {{had some}} flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the Aviation Cadet Training Program. On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and received his pilot rating in 1938 at Kelly Field in San Antonio.|$|E

5|$|Modeste {{was clearly}} {{visible in the}} harbour, {{anchored}} at the mole near two tartanes (small Mediterranean sailing craft here armed with four guns and carrying crews of around 70 men). The senior officers of the squadron held a council {{to determine the best}} course of action, and decided that since diplomatic options had failed and the Genoese appeared to support the French, the British would resort <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> solution. On the afternoon of 5 October Bedford was slowly warped into the harbour and alongside Modeste, as Reeve launched the ship's boats from Captain and brought them close {{to the other side of}} the French frigate.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty {{for three days and}} nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> hospital.|$|E

5|$|Ranariddh has 12 half-siblings {{from his}} father by {{different}} wives; Norodom Buppha Devi is the only full-sibling of Ranariddh. Buppha Devi became a ballet dancer, like her mother Phat Kanhol had been during her younger days. Kanhol remarried in 1947 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> officer, Chap Huot, and had five children with him. Phat Kanhol died from cancer in February 1969 {{at the age of}} 49, while Chap Huot was killed in an explosion a year later.

Chap Nhalyvoud served as the governor of Siem Reap Province between 1998 and 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{bibliography}} of Fyodor Dostoyevsky comprises novels, novellas, short stories, essays and other literary works. Raised by a literate family, Dostoyevsky discovered literature {{at an early}} age, beginning when his mother introduced the Bible to him. Nannies near the hospitalsin the grounds {{of which he was}} raisedintroduced Dostoyevsky to fairy tales, legends and sagas. His mother's subscription to the Library of Reading gave him access to the leading contemporary Russian and non-Russian literature. After his mother's death, Dostoyevsky moved from a boarding school <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> academy and despite the resulting lack of money, he was captivated by literature until his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{land border}} {{disputes}} pertain to comparatively small strips of land. The Croatia–Slovenia border disputes are: along the Dragonja River's lower course where Slovenia claims three hamlets on the river's left bank; the Sveta Gera peak of Žumberak where exact territorial claims were never made {{and appear to}} be limited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> barracks on the peak itself; and along the Mura River where Slovenia wants the border to be along the current river bed instead of along a former one and claims a (largely if not completely uninhabited) piece of land near Hotiza. These claims are likewise {{in the process of}} being settled by binding arbitration.|$|E

5|$|Various episodes also {{deal with}} the {{relationship}} between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically. Mulder and Scully are joined by John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) late in the series, after Mulder is abducted. Doggett replaces him as Scully's partner and helps her search for him, later involving Reyes, of whom Doggett had professional knowledge. The X-Files ends when Mulder is secretly subjected <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> tribunal for breaking into a Top Secret military facility and viewing plans for alien invasion and colonization of Earth. He is found guilty, but he escapes punishment {{with the help of}} the other agents and he and Scully become fugitives.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, {{with the onset of}} World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. The large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed in order to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observation of the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> contractor and returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|Banza soon {{decided to}} stage a coup d'état. He confided in a few {{military}} officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of {{the date of the}} coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> tribunal, which quickly sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in Time and Le Monde. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators.|$|E

5|$|Beale {{suggested}} that, {{in addition}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> fort, the route {{was also in}} immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements. Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and San Bernardino, California, a distance of , were the Zuni and Laguna pueblos. According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his initial survey of the route, and his interpreter, Petro. Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping with the animals in the pack train. The Rose–Baley Party paid Savedra's fee of $500 in advance.|$|E

5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises {{spurred on by}} civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was forced by the chancellor.|$|E
