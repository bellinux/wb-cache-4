The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E

40|$|Background. Cannabis use may trigger or {{perpetuate}} {{clinical features}} of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals, thereby {{contributing to the}} morbidity of schizophrenia and its burden of disease. These findings have mostly not considered the views of schizophrenia patients on cannabis use {{and its effect on}} their mental health.   Methods. A semi-structured 16 -point opinion-type questionnaire was formulated from the results of a previous qualitative study on schizophrenia patients’ opinions about cannabis use. The questionnaire was applied to 60 participants from an inpatient schizophrenia population at Weskoppies Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, who had a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th edition (text revision) (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of schizophrenia and a documented history of cannabis use.   Results. According to participants’ responses, 61. 7 % admitted to suffering from a mental illness, 95. 0 % admitted to using cannabis in the past, and 20. 0 % of participants admitted to the current use of cannabis. Over half (51. 7 %) of the participants responded that cannabis had adverse effects on their mental health, 26. 7 % that their mental illness was caused by using an illicit drug other than cannabis, 26. 7 % that only impure cannabis had adverse effects on their mental health, and 48. 3 % that only using too much cannabis had bad effects on their mind. A high percentage (58. 3 %) of participants responded that cannabis use helped reduce tension, 56. 7 % <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> reduce anxiety, 66. 7 % <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> to lift their mood, 63. 3 % <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> them to relax, 60. 0 % <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> to relieve their boredom, 43. 3 % <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> them feel more energetic, 58. 3 % <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> them sleep better, 13. 3 % <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> reduce auditory hallucinations, and 31. 7 % that the beneficial effects of cannabis outweighed its negative effects.   Conclusion. Most of the participants who responded that they were not using cannabis currently had positive views about its effects on their mental health, despite responding that cannabis may have adverse effects on their mental health. This is a worrisome outcome, since those participants who feel that cannabis has more beneficial than detrimental effects might not remain abstinent...|$|R
25|$|Neoliberalism rose to {{prominence}} after the 1970s and neoliberal shock therapy became increasingly {{used as a}} response to economic crises, for example by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.

25|$|Although this {{scheduling}} formula determines {{each of the}} thirty-two teams' respective opponents, {{the league}} usually does not release the final regular schedule with specific dates and times until the spring; the NFL needs several months to coordinate the entire season schedule so that, among other reasons, games are worked around various scheduling conflicts, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> maximize TV ratings.

25|$|Proponents of {{this model}} claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> to explain when and how {{language}} in our species emerged. Among 'Machiavellian', competitive nonhuman primates, sex is {{a major source of}} conflict, mutual suspicion and mistrust, as a result of which group members attempt to minimise the cost of deception by responding only to bodily signals which are intrinsically 'hard to fake'. This social pressure from receivers prevents language from even beginning to emerge. FCC theorists argue that for signals as cheap and intrinsically unreliable as words to become socially accepted, unprecedentedly intense levels of in-group trust were required. An effect of the Female Cosmetic Coalitions strategy, claim its supporters, was to minimise internal sexual conflict within each gender group, giving rise to a trusting social atmosphere such as is found among extant human egalitarian hunter-gatherers. These new levels of public trust, according to supporters of the model, enabled our species' latent linguistic capacities to flourish where previously they had been suppressed.|$|E
25|$|At {{times when}} a death {{sentence}} is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, {{the first step in}} collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.|$|E

500|$|According to Gayle Smith, {{a family}} lawyer, {{there are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to a joint physical custody arrangement. One benefit of joint physical custody is that the burden of sole custody is not placed on the parent as the time involved in raising the children is divided among the two parties involved, allowing each of the parties more time to spend on their careers, for instance. A second benefit of joint physical custody is that the children will still have a [...] "significant period" [...] of time {{with each of the}} parents, which closely resembles the relationship before the divorce, legal separation, or break-up.

500|$|Physical play in hockey, {{consisting}} of allowed {{techniques such as}} checking and prohibited techniques such as elbowing, high-sticking, and cross-checking, is inextricably linked to fighting. Although often a target of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights. Those who defend fighting in hockey say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates. The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or [...] "heavyweights") knocking each other out, administrators at the professional level are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential. Most fans and players oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games, but considerable opposition to fighting exists and efforts to eliminate it continue.|$|E

At {{the beginning of the}} season Lana is forced to come to terms with her diminished feelings for Whitney, as well as her growing feelings for Clark. It takes time before Lana is strong enough to finally tell Whitney the truth, in a video message, about the way she feels. The Talon, a local coffee shop co-owned by Lana, becomes her new grounding force as Whitney and her aunt have left Smallville. Kreuk thinks that it can be hard to believe that a sixteen-year-old girl could become co-owner of a coffee shop, but she believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> to provide more independence for the character and establish her more within the show. Eventually, in order to really get to know herself, and find her role in life, Lana leaves Smallville for Paris. In season four, Kristin Kreuk felt like Lana is [...] "going a little crazy and is uncertain about her direction, and feels people aren't validating her beliefs".|$|E
500|$|The {{heart of}} an {{elephant}} weighs [...] It has a double-pointed apex, an unusual trait among mammals. In addition, the ventricles separate {{near the top}} of the heart, a trait they share with sirenians. When standing, the elephant's heart beats approximately 30 times per minute. Unlike many other animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down. The blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressures. The lungs are attached to the diaphragm, and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage. Connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity. This may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air, although this explanation has been questioned. Another possible function for this adaptation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> the animal suck up water through the trunk. Elephants inhale mostly through the trunk, although some air goes through the mouth. They have a hindgut fermentation system, and their large and small intestines together reach [...] in length. The majority of an elephant's food intake goes undigested despite the process lasting up to a day.|$|E
