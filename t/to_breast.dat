5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> {{cancer in}} men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E

Desperate {{to get rid}} of Nancy, Sienna frames Nancy for several dilemmas, including leaving Oscar trapped in a fire, {{in order to make it}} look like she is still addicted to painkillers. Tom catches Sienna trying <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> feed Oscar, although Sienna accuses Tom of trying to take topless pictures of her. Darren believes Sienna's lies that Nancy is still a painkiller addict, resulting in Nancy moving out and Darren and Sienna beginning a relationship. Sienna begins faking a pregnancy although is devastated when she overhears Darren saying he doesn't want the baby. In order to get Darren closer, Sienna attempts to officially get rid of Nancy and she frames Nancy for trying to kill Oscar, Charlie and herself. Nancy is taken to a mental institute because of this. Darren later finds out that Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth) is his mother and disowns Jack for lying to him for years. Darren, Sienna and Oscar move out because of this. Tom realizes what Sienna has done to Nancy and attempts to expose her by putting a video camera in her bedroom. Darren finds the video camera, however, and assumes that Tom had been trying to film Sienna topless again leaving Darren furious with Tom. Darren later makes up with Jack when he is nearly killed in an explosion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Metastases <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> occur rarely, {{but may be}} {{increasing}} in incidence as patients live longer with malignant diseases. The {{aim of this study}} is to characterize metastatic disease <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> and <b>to</b> describe the management and prognosis of patients who present with this diagnosis. Methods A retrospective review of our institution's pathology and breast cancer databases was performed in order to identify patients with breast malignancies that were not of primary breast origin. Chart review provided additional information about the patients' primary malignancies and course of illness. Results Between 1991 and 2006, eighteen patients with metastatic disease <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> of non-hematologic origin were identified and all had charts available for review. Among the 18 patients with disease metastatic <b>to</b> the <b>breast,</b> tissues of origin included 3 ovarian, 6 melanoma, 3 medullary thyroid, 3 pulmonary neuroendocrine, 1 pulmonary small cell, 1 oral squamous cell, and 1 renal cell. Overall mean survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> was 22. 4 months. Treatment of metastases varied and included combinations of observation, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Five patients (27. 8 %) required a change in management of their breast disease for local control. Conclusion Due to the variable course of patients with metastatic disease, a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for each patient with disease metastatic <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> <b>to</b> determine optimal treatment. Based on our review, many patients survive for long periods of time and local treatment of metastases <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> may be beneficial in these patients to prevent local complications. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background. Primary ovarian {{carcinoma}} with metastasis <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> is rare, {{with only}} 39 cases {{reported in the}} current literature. Ovarian metastasis <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> presenting as inflammatory breast carcinoma is even more infrequent, with only 6 cases reported. Case. We present a patient who developed metastatic inflammatory cancer of the breast from a stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinoma approximately 1 year after the original diagnosis. Pathologic analysis confirmed {{the origin of the}} tumor: a high-grade adenocarcinoma morphologically similar to the previously diagnosed ovarian cancer. In addition, the tumor was strongly positive on immunohistochemistry for CA- 125, identical to the ovarian primary. The patient died of diffuse metastasis 5 months after the breast tumor was noted. Conclusion. Although ovarian metastasis <b>to</b> the <b>breast</b> presenting as inflammatory breast cancer is rare, it {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis for any patient with a personal history of ovarian cancer. Accurate differentiation is necessary because treatment differs significantly for patients with ovarian metastasis <b>to</b> the <b>breast,</b> as compared with patients with primary inflammatory breast cancer.
