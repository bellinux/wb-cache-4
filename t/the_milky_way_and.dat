5|$|Actual {{proof of}} the Milky Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions.

5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> Andromeda galaxies should be underway.

5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct {{a map of the}} Milky Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars.|$|E

5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E

5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Only three Milky Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E
50|$|This {{minor planet}} {{was named after}} the Duch-born {{astronomer}} couple Bart Bok (1906-1983) and Priscilla Fairfield Bok (1896-1975), in recognition for their contribution to astrometry of small Solar System bodies. Both astronomers studied the structure of <b>the</b> southern <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> fostered astronomy in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> galaxy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nearby Andromeda Galaxy {{are moving}} toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years.

5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy is}} a member of an {{association}} named the Local Group, a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately onemegaparsec. <b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> <b>and</b> the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies. The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo Cluster. And the Virgo Supercluster itself {{is a part of the}} Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.|$|E
5|$|The WHT is {{equipped}} {{with a wide range of}} instruments operating over the optical and near-infrared regimes. These are used by professional astronomers to conduct a wide range of astronomical research. Astronomers using the telescope discovered the first evidence for a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> made the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst. The telescope has 75% clear nights, with a median seeing of 0.7".|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>and</b> elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E

40|$|Three {{theoretical}} problems {{concerning the}} large scale structure of disk galaxies in general, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> System, in particular, were proposed to study.

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the {{importance}} of high-resolution absorption spectroscopy for {{our understanding of the}} distribution and physical nature of the gaseous circumgalactic medium (CGM) that surrounds <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> Observational <b>and</b> theoretical studies indicate a high complexity of the gas kinematics and an extreme multi-phase nature of the CGM in low-redshift galaxies. High-precision absorption-line measurements of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> gas environment thus are essential to explore fundamental parameters of circumgalactic gas in the local Universe, such as mass, chemical composition, and spatial distribution. We shortly review important characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> CGM <b>and</b> discuss recent results from our multi-wavelength observations of the Magellanic Stream. Finally, we discuss the potential of studying the warm-hot phase of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> CGM by searching for extremely weak [Fe X] &# 955; 6374. 5 &# 197; and [Fe XIV] &# 955; 5302. 9 &# 197; absorption in optical QSO spectra...|$|R
