25|$|In 1859, one of Roach's closest friends, {{a lawyer}} named John Baker, died and left Roach the trustee of his estate. The estate, worth $70,000, was {{entrusted}} to Roach for investment until Baker's four children came of age. Since the money {{could not be}} claimed until 1881, it {{was as good as}} a long-term interest-free loan to Roach, who was soon <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to expand his business.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the failure}} of Johnson's assault, Hood decided to end {{offensive}} actions for the evening and began to plan for a resumed series of attacks in the morning. Schofield ordered his infantry to cross the river, starting at 11 p.m. Although {{there was a period}} in which the Union army was vulnerable, outside its works and straddling the river, Hood did not attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> during the night. The Union army began entering the breastworks at Nashville at noon on December 1, with Hood's damaged army in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 23, Warren and Hancock {{approached}} the North Anna. There were no significant fortifications to their front. Lee had misjudged Grant's plan, assuming any advance against the North Anna would be a mere diversion, while {{the main body of}} Grant's army continued its flanking march to the east. At the Chesterfield Bridge crossing the Telegraph Road, a small South Carolina brigade under Col. John W. Henagan had created a dirt redoubt, and there was a small party guarding the railroad bridge downstream, but all the other river crossings were left undefended. Grant had been presented with a golden opportunity if he moved quickly enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|His friend Tina Strobos was not Jewish {{and thus}} {{was free of}} {{restrictions}} and threat of incarceration. She arranged hiding places for Pais and other Jews in Amsterdam. When the Germans began forcing the Dutch Jews into a ghetto in the old Jewish quarter of Amsterdam, his sister Annie and her husband Hermann complied. Tina found them a place to hide, but despite Pais's urgent pleas for them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> they {{did not think it}} necessary. Annie was later killed at the Sobibór extermination camp. Tina had found refuge for Pais's parents on a farm outside Amsterdam where they survived the war.

25|$|Judicial {{review is}} {{available}} {{as a means of}} challenging the legality of decisions of all governmental authorities, though it is regarded as a procedure of last resort that should be used only where the individual has no alternative remedy such as a right of appeal. If a right of appeal exists, it is more favourable for a person <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as the appellate court may substitute its decision for that of the original authority and grant a remedy. An appeal may also involve a reconsideration of the merits of the case and not merely its legality, although this depends on the wording of the statute in question. On the other hand, when exercising judicial review, the High Court is almost always limited to examining whether public authorities have acted lawfully, and do not evaluate the substantive merits of decisions taken.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the failure}} of Johnson's assault, Hood decided to end {{offensive}} actions for the evening and began to plan for a resumed series of attacks in the morning. Schofield ordered his infantry to cross the river, starting at 11 p.m., despite objections from Cox that withdrawal was no longer necessary and that Hood was weakened and should be counter-attacked. Schofield had received orders from Thomas to evacuate earlier that day—before Hood's attack began—and {{he was happy to}} take advantage of them despite the changed circumstances. Although there was a period in which the Union army was vulnerable, outside its works and straddling the river, Hood did not attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> during the night.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 23, Warren reached Mount Carmel Church and paused for instructions. Hancock's corps came up from behind and the two units got hopelessly mixed up on the road. The corps commanders decided that Hancock would {{continue}} along the Telegraph Road to Chesterfield Bridge while Warren would cross the North Anna upstream at Jericho Mills. There were no significant fortifications to their front. Lee had misjudged Grant's plan, assuming that any advance against the North Anna would be a mere diversion, while {{the main body of}} Grant's army continued its flanking march to the east.

It begins raining, and Elle decides <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> She releases an electrical charge, which travels through the water {{on the ground and}} into Claude, but she, too, is knocked unconscious in the process. Claude and his friends, Abigail and Lee, carry her to his place and he begins to show Elle the source of her problem. Things get ugly when Elle accidentally shocks Abigail, which leads them to fight each other; Abigail's force field redirects Elle's lightning towards Lee, so Elle stops and then is asked to leave the place. Although Claude asks her to stay, she prefers to look for the help of Noah, so she goes to Costa Verde and attacks Lyle while waiting for his father.|$|E

2500|$|An eye is {{essentially}} a darkened chamber with a small hole in front that allows light to enter. The lens, just behind the pupil’s aperture, is perfectly clear but appears black because the interior space behind it is dark. Rays of light pass through the lens, producing an upside-down image on the retina. [...] The brain reorients the image. This optical process of projecting an inverted image {{is known as a}} camera obscura (from the Latin, meaning dark room). The first pinhole/camera obscura eyes evolved about 540 million years ago on a sea mollusk, known as a nautilus, during the Cambrian period. The camera obscura principle is primordial, and life on earth has evolved <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Tramways Act of 1870 {{was passed}} {{to enable the}} easier {{construction}} of street tramways, and the company promoting the line through Stonehouse was the first <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The tramway was opened on 18 March 1872. Starting from Derry's Clock by the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, it ran along Union Street and passed under the railway viaduct before entering Stonehouse. It then crossed over the [...] "Halfpenny Bridge" [...] (a toll bridge across a tidal creek) and entered Devonport. After climbing Devonport Hill it terminated at Cumberland Street. Two years later the line was extended beyond Cumberland Street along Chapel Street, Fore Street and Marlborough Street. This was a loop on which trams ran in an anti-clockwise direction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main road}} across the Maya Pass ascends from the French side {{to reach the}} Spanish village of Urdax. From Urdax, the road rises to the pass before {{descending}} toward Elizondo. Farther east the Gorospil path rises from the French village of Espelette before passing near the Aretesque knoll. Then the path turns west along the Maya ridge and crosses the main road. The Gorospil path later {{became known as the}} Chemin des Anglais after the British improved it. There was a lot of dead ground in front of the Maya ridge and d'Erlon resolved <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> D'Erlon sent Maransin's division up the main road but gave that general instructions to stay out of sight until the other two divisions seized the east end of the ridge. That morning, Darmagnac's division marched from Espelette on the Gorospil path with Abbé's division following right behind.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Embassy, which {{supplied}} {{and trained}} the Royalists and Neutralists, was equivocal about the attack. The projected manpower odds were six to one favoring the RLG. Ambassador Unger noted that success was chancy, {{and that the}} overt American action involved might {{call attention to the}} U.S. violation of the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos. He thought even success might bring [...] "bitter criticism" [...] upon the Lao government and himself. The 26 June 1964 assessment by the Embassy stated that the Pathet Lao's [...] "exposed position and other difficuties create an opportunity rarely encountered in Laos. Failure <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> might be nearly as bad psychologically as trying and failing." [...] Despite this wishy-washy estimate, and the RLG failure in the recent Battles of Lak Sao and Luang Namtha, the Embassy favored Operation Triangle. Unger was told that President Lyndon Baines Johnson was personally monitoring the worth of the operation. The President's approval was not the only Washington influence on the operation; upper level bureaucrats were also involved in managing it.|$|E
2500|$|When the Brazilian {{government}} {{discovered what}} Otaviano had negotiated − and in particular, the concessions {{he had made}} in favour of Argentina − it was not pleased; and {{the terms of the}} Treaty were strongly criticised by the Conservative opposition. The general belief in Brazil was that she did not need an alliance with Argentina in order to beat Paraguay, only that Argentina should keep out of the way. [...] The Emperor referred the Treaty to the Section of Foreign Affairs of the Council of State. [...] That body advised that the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was disadvantageous to Brazil in several ways, making it too easy for Argentina to annex Paraguay at some future date, and too difficult for the Brazilian navy to blockade Paraguay should that need ever arise. [...] Otaviano's terms were severely criticised but he riposted that the situation in 1865 was so critical that if Argentina had wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> [...] "we would have given them twice, or three times as much".|$|E
