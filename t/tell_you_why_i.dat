2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E
