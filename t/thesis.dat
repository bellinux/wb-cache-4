It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his <b>thesis</b> on Wilhelm von Schütz.

5|$|Harald {{became the}} first of the two Bohr {{brothers}} to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a <b>thesis</b> on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's <b>thesis</b> into his much-larger Doctor of Philosophy (dr. phil.) <b>thesis.</b> He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The <b>thesis</b> was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohr's <b>thesis</b> was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's <b>thesis</b> that is today known as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem.|$|E

Our mission has been to acquire and preserve a comprehensive collection of Canadian <b>theses</b> and {{to provide access to}} them within Canada and throughout the world. As many Canadian universities move rapidly towards electronic <b>theses</b> submission programs our mission has expanded to include the acquisition and preservation of Canadian <b>theses</b> in this new format and to support Canadian universities during the transition period. To this end a <b>theses</b> portal is being developed for the National Library of Canada website. Our goal is to make the portal a comprehensive repository of freely available Canadian electronic <b>theses</b> and dissertations. Expected to be launched by the end of 2003, phase one of the <b>Theses</b> Canada Online Portal will include bibliographic records for the over 225, 000 <b>theses</b> in our collection, as well as approximately 45, 000 full text electronic <b>theses</b> digitized for <b>Theses</b> Canada by UMI Dissertations Publishing during the period 1998 - 2002. Planning for phase two of the portal development, which will permit Canadian universities to submit e-theses and metadata directly to the National Library of Canada, is already underway. The National Library of Canada has been represented on the NDLTD Steering Committee since its inception in 1997.

The DART-Europe partners have collaborated to build the DART-Europe E-theses Portal, a service which enables the discovery and delivery of over 100, 000 open access, doctoral e-theses from a growing number of European countries. DART-Europe provides Universities and academic consortia with the opportunity for their research <b>theses</b> to be discovered and read by a global audience. The Portal harvests records from sources across Europe to make <b>theses</b> discoverable in one search. Electronic access to research <b>theses</b> makes it much easier for a user to locate the information that he/she wants. In a paper environment, research <b>theses</b> are not so easy to find and the full-text is often stored away from the main campus. With DART-Europe, European <b>theses</b> can be discovered and delivered very easily.

Dumitru Diaconu, a law professor and author supposedly plagiarised by Ponta's <b>thesis,</b> and who also authored a foreword for the published edition of the <b>thesis,</b> declared he was not aware of plagiarism and did not intend to pursue the accusations. A session of a committee charged with validating academic titles analyzed the <b>thesis</b> and decided with a unanimous vote of members present that Ponta had committed copy and paste plagiarism, subsequently requesting the withdrawal of Ponta's doctoral title. In response, interim Education Minister Liviu Pop (PSD) contested the committee's jurisdiction and dismissed the findings, citing the lack of a quorum. The minister had already signed an order reorganizing the committee the previous day, but, due to technical reasons, the order came into effect during the very session analyzing the <b>thesis.</b>|$|E
