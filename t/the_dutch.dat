5|$|Against this {{background}} the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor {{participants in the}} negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free English shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> even being consulted. <b>The</b> <b>Dutch</b> ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> colonies, and that France had promised {{not to make a}} separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to deduct the value of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, a necessity in the shallow waters of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. <b>The</b> <b>Dutch</b> did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|E

Despite the stubborn resistance offered by <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river.

5|$|By March 1906 {{the other}} kingdoms had all fallen, leaving Tiku {{as the last}} Torajan lord. <b>The</b> <b>Dutch</b> took Rantepao without a struggle, unaware that the city's {{surrender}} had been arranged by Tiku. Through a letter, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> commander Captain Kilian told Tiku to surrender, a demand Tiku was unwilling to entertain. Aware of Tiku's gathered forces and numerous fortresses, Kilian did not attempt a direct attack. Instead, in April 1906 he sent an expeditionary party to Tondon. Although the party's approach was not resisted, after nightfall Tiku's troops attacked <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> camp in Tondon; this forced <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> forces to retreat to Rantepao with Tiku's men in pursuit, suffering numerous casualties along the way.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Congress of London's {{verdict in}} 1830, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> {{continued}} to resist Belgian independence {{for much of}} Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army {{back as far as}} Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed the fragility of the Belgian position, and although <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> until 1890.|$|E

5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking his ship.

As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits).

5|$|From the 17th century, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> {{established}} {{trade and}} political control on Sulawesi through <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> East Indies Company. Over two centuries, they ignored the mountainous {{area in the}} central Sulawesi, where Torajans lived, because access was difficult and it had little productive agricultural land. In the late 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> became increasingly concerned about the spread of Islam {{in the south of}} Sulawesi, especially among the Makassarese and Bugis peoples. <b>The</b> <b>Dutch</b> saw the animist highlanders as potential Christians. In the 1920s, the Reformed Missionary Alliance of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Reformed Church began missionary work aided by <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> colonial government. In addition to introducing Christianity, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> abolished slavery and imposed local taxes. A line was drawn around the Sa'dan area and called Tana Toraja ("the land of Toraja"). Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the Luwu kingdom that had claimed the area. In 1946, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> granted Tana Toraja a regentschap, and it was recognised in 1957 as one of the regencies of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic. This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, erstwhile allies of <b>the</b> <b>Dutch,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with <b>the</b> <b>Dutch.</b> The villages saw that it was in their {{interest}} to maintain good relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> soldiers, causing <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> to ask for protection from retribution. Although <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine who <b>the</b> Pennsylvania <b>Dutch</b> people are in light of American {{immigration}} history, interviews with Pennsylvania Dutch community leaders and scholars, performance observations, and printed text resources in order to evaluate how members of the Pennsylvania German community are actively promoting and preserving the Pennsylvania German dialect {{through the medium of}} performance.

5|$|Mutual {{distrust}} {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic hindered negotiations. The Republic feared a second major Dutch offensive, while <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> objected to continued Republican activity on <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> {{side of the}} Renville line. In February 1948 the Siliwangi Division (35,000 men) of the Republican Army, led by Nasution, marched from West Java to Central Java; the relocation was intended to ease internal Republican tensions involving the Division in the Surakarta area. The Battalion, however, clashed with Dutch troops while crossing Mount Slamet, and <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> believed {{it was part of}} a systematic troop movement across the Renville Line. The fear of such incursions actually succeeding, along with apparent Republican undermining of the Dutch-established Pasundan state and negative reports, led to <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> leadership increasingly seeing itself as losing control.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1907 Tiku {{and two of}} his {{men were}} caught by <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> forces; he was the last guerrilla leader to be caught.
