5|$|By June 12, the Cuban {{government}} had evacuated over 25,000people {{in the western}} portion of the country due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> flooding. The National Hurricane Center recommended tropical storm warnings for the Isle of Youth and the Pinar del Río Province early on June 10, {{but they were not}} issued by the Cuban government.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

5|$|In the Mexican city of Matamoros, located {{south of}} Brownsville, Texas, Captain Manuel Leon Lopez warned {{residents}} about the approaching hurricane through radio messages. Many people were seen leaving coastal villages and heading further inland. Mexican officials raised the alert level to stage three due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Barry.|$|E
5|$|Responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the typhoon, Japanese {{officials}} advised 600,000people in vulnerable {{areas to}} leave their homes. Bus and air services were disrupted, affecting over 10,000travelers. Nippon Oil suspended oil shipment at three refineries during the storm.|$|E
5|$|That {{road was}} built due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> American attack to provide quick access from Fort Erie, and, like other {{military}} roads in Upper Canada (e.g. Dundas Street or Yonge Street), it travelled {{in a straight}} line, in this case parallel to the Lake Erie shoreline.|$|E

5|$|After a lahar {{demolished}} her home, Sánchez became pinned {{beneath the}} debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Because of its rapid movement, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on December 22. As the storm weakened, the watches were discontinued. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane, officials posted a small craft advisory along the coastline of northern Puerto Rico. There, the weakening tropical cyclone produced light rainfall, {{though there was}} no reported damage. Lili moved through Hispaniola as an area of squally weather, but damage, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|By September18, power {{services}} {{had been}} {{restored to the}} state of Guerrero. That day, gas and water services were revived in Acapulco. Emergency declarations were requested in Angostura and Navolato. Within 12hours after its second landfall, power was retrieved to 26,000 dwellings in Sinaloa. In La Pintada, the search process for victims was halted briefly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> another mudslide, but on September20, 100rescuers resumed searching, who frequently had to dig through mud to recover bodies.|$|E

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> American {{submarines}} {{and aircraft}} carriers, both Yamato and Musashi spent {{the majority of}} their careers in naval bases at Brunei, Truk, and Kure—deploying on several occasions in response to American raids on Japanese bases—before participating in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, as part of Admiral Kurita's Centre Force. Musashi was sunk during the battle by American carrier airplanes. Shinano was sunk ten days after her commissioning in November 1944 by the submarine , while Yamato was sunk by US naval air power in April 1945 during Operation Ten-Go.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> landslides, 5,500 {{households}} {{were evacuated}} across the Amami Islands on August27.

The Shikoku Railway Company canceled service during the storm and limited rides along the West Japan Railway Company. About 860,000people were advised or ordered to evacuate their homes, including 88,100people from 15,400homes who were forced to leave. After the storm passed, residents were allowed to return home.|$|E
5000|$|This is a common, widely-distributed {{species in}} shallow reef environments.

5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD {{to tap into the}} lake. Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the Quagga mussel, an invasive species that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|In Mauritius, a {{total of}} 200people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters due to the cyclone. The island was under a Cyclone Warning Class III for 36hours, {{and for a few}} more hours it was under a Cyclone Warning Class IV, the latter meaning wind gusts of 120km/h (75mph) were reported or expected. Prior to the storm affecting the area, officials in Réunion closed schools and also issued a temporary driving ban. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the storm, several flights in and out of Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were canceled. Fishermen were banned from sailing out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Kingswear Castle is an {{artillery}} fort, built to protect Dartmouth harbour in Devon, England. It was constructed between 1491 and 1502 in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> French attack {{and was one}} of the first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain. By the end of the 16th century, however, improvements in the range of artillery weapons had reduced the utility of the castle. It took part in the English Civil War and continued to be armed until the early 18th century, but fell into ruin. Restored as a summer house in 1855, in the 21st century it is managed by the Landmark Trust as a holiday let.|$|E

5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a greater emphasis {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of eastern}} Cuba, already under storm alert, was placed under a State of Emergency due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Georges. President Castro {{emphasized}} {{the severity of}} the hurricane during a two-hour address to the nation on September23. He explained, in great detail, civil preparation maps and impacts from past hurricanes. His last note was that he would refuse any aid from the United States as they (Cuba) would not accept aid from a country that has an embargo on them.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{tropical}} storms or hurricanes made landfall. One of the two tropical depressions of the season, Five-E, came ashore near Salina Cruz, Mexico, {{on the last day}} of June. The depression caused the only fatality of the season, injured five hundred, with two people missing. Delores, Ignacio and Marty threatened the coast of Mexico, coming close enough to require tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Of these, Ignacio was also responsible for 40 injuries as the system passed just offshore of Lázaro Cárdenas. Public advisories were issued for four other systems due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> heavy rain along the coast.|$|E
