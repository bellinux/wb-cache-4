5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fog</b> <b>of</b> war led {{to several}} {{instances}} where the Royal Navy misidentified several vessels as Roon in 1916. On 16 February 1916, Roon was mistakenly reported {{as having been}} captured by a British cruiser in the North Atlantic. The ship was also mistakenly reported to have taken part in the Battle of Jutland as the flagship of the screening force for {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet. This mistake appeared in historical works published shortly after the First World War, but later works have corrected it.|$|E
5|$|By August 1980 Umboh had {{recovered}} enough strength to direct his next film, Disini Cinta Pertama Kali Bersemi (Here Love Bloomed for the First Time), {{based on the}} novel by Mira W. Shortly before directing Putri Seorang Jenderal (A General's Daughter; an adaptation of Motinggo Busye's novel of the same name) in 1981, Umboh divorced Roemokoy. Umboh converted to Islam in 1983 and changed his name to Ahmad Salim. On 24 August of the following year Umboh married Inne Ermina Chomid, a police officer's daughter of Sundanese descent 28 years his junior. As his health was improving, Umboh continued to make films, including Kabut Perkawinan (<b>The</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>of</b> Wedlock; 1984). Umboh and Chomid had a son, William Umboh Ikhsan Salim, in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} online multiplayer. Having five maps as standard, matches can {{be carried}} out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer. Random battles are played either with standard rules, or with special limitations. <b>The</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>of</b> War environmental effect is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes. In addition, Fates features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of Fire Emblem Awakenings Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.|$|E

5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by <b>the</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>of</b> War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>of</b> War, 2003 American {{documentary}} {{film about the}} life and times of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara directed by Errol Morris, which won that years' Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Morris won the Oscar for Best Documentary for <b>The</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>of</b> War, a {{film about}} the career of Robert S. McNamara, the Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. In the hauntingly re-enacted opening about McNamara {{relationship}} with U.S. General Curtis LeMay during World War II, Morris brings out complexities {{in the character of}} McNamara, which shaped McNamara's positions in the Cuban missile crisis and the Vietnam War. Like his earlier documentary, The Thin Blue Line, <b>The</b> <b>Fog</b> <b>of</b> War included extensive use of re-enactments, a technique which many had believed was inappropriate for documentaries.|$|E

In the mid-2000s Glass provided the scores to films such as Secret Window (2004), Neverwas (2005), The Illusionist and Notes on a Scandal, garnering his third Academy Award nomination for the latter. Glass's most recent film scores include No Reservations (Glass makes a brief cameo in the film sitting at an outdoor café), Cassandra's Dream (2007), Les Regrets (2009), Mr Nice (2010), the Brazilian film Nosso Lar (2010) and Fantastic Four (2015, in collaboration with Marco Beltrami). In 2009, Glass composed original theme music for Transcendent Man, about the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil by filmmaker Barry Ptolemy.|$|E
25|$|For {{the cost}} of twelve {{aircraft}} (four Ju 87s), he helped attack French communication and supply positions, and supported Reichenau {{as he reached the}} Dyle river. At that time, he had moved into the Netherlands, at a Hotel, near Maastricht. He had a basic room, with a bath that did not work. In the afternoon, he received an order to cease operations in Belgium, and send all he had to support Georg-Hans Reinhardt's XLI Corps, north of Sedan. Richthofen was incredulous, and he had to move his entire infrastructure 100 kilometres to the south. The failure of the OKL to inform him he was to support the breakthrough is difficult to explain. He later noted in his diary that it was a major oversight for the OKL not to have informed him of his expected input, but his diary also suggests he relished <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> <b>of</b> war and the unknown. His forces were split, with LG 1 and StG 2 continuing support in Belgium, while most were moved south. During the winding down of operations in the north, his units did help the Sixth Army capture Liege in Belgium on 17 May.|$|E
25|$|Guards {{initially}} {{laughed at}} the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some {{were reported to have}} experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen fingers on the back of their neck, and crying in the night. The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> <b>of</b> San Francisco bay.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{started with}} an {{exchange}} of gunfire at long range, the federal gunboats {{setting up a line}} of battle across the river and firing their rear guns at the cottonclads coming up to meet them as they entered the battle stern first. Two of the four rams advanced beyond the line of the gunboats and rammed or otherwise disrupted the movements of their opponents; the other rams misinterpreted their orders and did not enter the battle at all. With the federal rams and gunboats not coordinating their movements and the Confederate vessels operating independently, the battle soon was reduced to a melee. It is agreed by all that the ram flagship, , initiated hostilities by slamming into CSS Colonel Lovell. She was then rammed in turn by {{one or more of the}} remaining cottonclads. Ellet was at this time wounded by a pistol shot in his knee, thereby becoming the only casualty on the Union side. (In the hospital, he contracted measles, the childhood disease that killed some 5,000 soldiers during the war. The combination of the disease and the debilitation caused by his wound was too great, and he died on June 21.) The remainder of the battle is obscured by more than <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> <b>of</b> war. Several eyewitness accounts are available; however, they are mutually contradictory to a greater degree than usual. All that is certain is that at the end of the battle, all but one of the cottonclads were either destroyed or captured, and one Yankee boat, Queen of the West, was disabled. The sole boat to escape, CSS General Earl Van Dorn, fled to the protection of the Yazoo River, just north of Vicksburg. Personnel losses among the Confederates cannot be estimated reliably.|$|E

500|$|Rothbard embraced [...] "historical revisionism" [...] as an {{antidote}} to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt [...] "court intellectuals" [...] over mainstream historical narratives. Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of [...] "the state" [...] in exchange for [...] "wealth, power, and prestige" [...] from the state. Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as [...] "penetrating <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> <b>of</b> lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history". He was influenced by and called a champion of the historian Harry Elmer Barnes, a Holocaust denier. Rothbard endorsed Barnes's revisionism on World War II, favorably citing his view that [...] "the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II". In addition to broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.|$|E
500|$|In {{the film}} Madsen tried to {{challenge}} the idea of war as [...] "black and white" [...] {{and the idea that}} the resistance was [...] "a cohesive whole". He says of war that it [...] "has many more nuances, it is grayer, less defined. When an enemy may stop being one at any time and a friend can become an enemy overnight, things become less clear". Ella Taylor of The Village Voice commented, [...] "Flame & Citron is less about the battle between good and evil than about losing one's way in <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> <b>of</b> war, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to sort through the rules of engagement, and complicates the heroic honor codes of movies about the 'good war.'" [...] Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post asserted that the violence in the film is double-edged: [...] " [...] takes its toll on the perpetrator as well as the victim." [...] Similarly, The Irish Timess Derek Scally stated the film analyses [...] "the dehumanising effect of assassinations on assassin".|$|E
500|$|Both episodes {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics.

He specifically cited the plot as a highlight, {{as well as the}} return to the series by Nanjiani as Prismo. Eric Kohn of IndieWire awarded both this episode and [...] "Escape from the Citadel" [...] an [...] "A–", writing that while the episode featured extremely dark material, it was never presented in a way so as to drive viewers away. Kohn wrote highly of the comedy and naturalistic dialogue that took place during Prismo's opening party in [...] "Wake Up", and felt that the addition about Prismo's origins helped the show slip [...] "in a certain wise gaze [...] <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> <b>of</b> time". In regards to [...] "Escape from the Citadel", he also noted that [...] "the fate of the Lich takes an amusing new turn," [...] and that the storyline concerning [...] "Finn's cursed sword arm—an ingredient that has festered in the sidelines for weeks—reaches a beguiling new state." ...|$|E
