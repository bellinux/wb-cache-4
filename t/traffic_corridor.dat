2500|$|Gautrain is an [...] mass {{rapid transit}} railway system in Gauteng, South Africa, which links Johannesburg, Pretoria, Ekhuruleni and O. R. Tambo International Airport. It {{was built to}} relieve the traffic {{congestion}} in the Johannesburg–Pretoria <b>traffic</b> <b>corridor</b> and offer commuters {{a viable alternative to}} road transport, as Johannesburg has limited public transport infrastructure. The project was completed with the opening on 7 June 2012 of the final section between Rosebank and Johannesburg Park Station, which had been delayed by problems with excess water seeping into the tunnel between the two stations.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} to develop a HSR line between Sydney and Canberra (via SYD airport and CBR airport) to link the two cities and to provide an effective second airport for Sydney. The line is also proposed to eventually continue on to Melbourne (also possibly via MEL airport). It {{is worth noting that}} the SYD-MEL air <b>traffic</b> <b>corridor</b> is one of the busiest in the world, HSR would allow for journey times city center to city center quicker than flights plus associated procedures and travel. In September 2010, Infrastructure Partnership Australia (IPA) and AECOM proposed an east coast very fast train corridor from the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane (Queensland) and onto Sydney (N.S.W), Canberra (A.C.T.) and through to Melbourne (Victoria).|$|E

40|$|Soil {{quality is}} {{critical}} to the management of urban green space, in particular, along <b>traffic</b> <b>corridors</b> where traffic-related air pollution is significant. Soil quality can be evaluated by soil enzyme activities, which show quick responses to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In this study, we investigated three soil enzyme activities (i. e., dehydrogenase, catalase and urease) along the major roads in urban areas of Beijing. Results show the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase and urease in urban samples were 58. 8 %, 68. 2 % and 48. 5 % less than the rural sample, respectively. The content of fluorescent amino acids as indicators of microbial activities was also consistently lower in urban samples than the rural. We observed two times greater exposure of particulate material along the roadsides in urban areas than rural areas. Although traffic air pollutants provide some nutrient sources to stimulate the URE activity, the exposure to traffic-related air pollution leads to the substantial decrease in enzyme activities. There were significant negative correlations for exposure to PM 10 with DHA (r = − 0. 8267, p = 0. 0017) and CAT (r = − 0. 89, p = 0. 0002) activities. For the urban soils URE activity increased with the increasing of PM. We conclude that the degraded soil quality can negatively affect the target of developing plants and green spaces along the <b>traffic</b> <b>corridors</b> to mitigate the traffic impact. This study suggests the investigation of integrated strategies to restore the soil quality, reinforce the ecological service functions of green spaces along the <b>traffic</b> <b>corridors</b> and reduce the traffic pollutants...|$|R
