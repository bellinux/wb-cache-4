500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E

[...] "I know {{tailored}} clothes when I see 'em. <b>You</b> {{just stopped}} <b>for</b> a moment on your way through the park. Don't mind my <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a while? I've got to be with somebody. I'm afraid--I'm afraid. I've told two or three of those bummers over about it. They think I'm crazy. Say--let me tell you--all I've had to eat to-day was a couple pretzels and an apple. To-morrow I'll stand in line to inherit three millions; and that restaurant you see over there with the autos around it will be too cheap for me to eat in. Don't believe it, do you? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] she decided, [...] "I suppose, after all, {{one must}} {{remember}} that you did save us from {{a great deal of}} inconvenience the other night. I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My love," [...] said Richard, [...] "there is no {{one with}} whom I have a greater wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> than <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "Only I feel I'd like to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{a little}} time, if you don't mind. It's nothing very much," [...] she continued, nervously {{twisting}} her handkerchief between her fingers.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will come}} and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes, if I may," [...] Deyes said. [...] "I leave the Church and {{agriculture}} to hobnob. Somehow I don't fancy that as a buffer I should be a success." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{simple one}} enough," [...] he answered. [...] "We got here all right, as {{we told you}} over the wire. Then Maqueda <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a long while until you rang off, saying <b>you</b> wanted <b>to</b> speak to Japhet. After that, at ten o'clock precisely, we heard the thud of the explosion. Next, as we were {{preparing}} to go out to see what had happened, Joshua arrived alone, announced that the idol Harmac had been destroyed, and demanded that the Child of Kings, 'for State reasons,' should accompany him to his own castle. She declined and, as he insisted, I took it upon myself to kick him out of the place. He retired, and we saw no more of him, but a few minutes later there came a shower of arrows down the passage, and after them a rush of men, who called, 'Death to the Gentiles. Rescue the Rose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{sit beside}} me, and I'll tell you, sir; that is, {{if you please}} I should love <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> it's lonely here when Bess is gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{knew you}} didn't love me! I felt it. D'you think I could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> five minutes without seeing the {{constraint}} in your manner? They told me I was foolish and fanciful, but I knew better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{a little}} time, Kate," [...] she begged. [...] "You are {{none of the}} things you fancy, and I am very sure that Mr. De la Borne does not care for me, or for my fortune. Stay just for a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should like," [...] he explained, [...] "to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{a quarter}} of an hour. This place is rather crowded and it is getting on my nerves. We seem to live here, night and day. Would you object to driving with me--say as far as Mentone and back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{was bound}} to happen. You're too good--for what it gave <b>you.</b> I didn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> out there <b>for</b> nothing. I saw things.... Let's go into the other room, and smoke and talk it over." [...] He stood up as he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} back to London," [...] she continued, {{lowering}} her voice a little, [...] "with some very strange impressions and some very pleasant memories. I feel that your life here is, in its way, very beautiful, and yet the contemplation of your future fills me with an immense curiosity. I have not <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> very long, Mr. Strangewey, {{and you may not}} be quite the sort of person I think you are, but I am seldom mistaken. I am an artist, you see, and we have perceptions. I think that even here the time will come when the great unrest will seize you, too, in its toils. Though the color may not fade from your hills, and though the apple-blossom may still glorify your orchard, and your flowers bloom and smell as sweetly, and your winds bring you the same music, I think that the time will come when the note in <b>you</b> which answers <b>to</b> these things, and which gives you contentment, will fail to respond. Then I think--I hope, perhaps--that we may meet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir. I {{never heard}} of either one of 'em," [...] said Harry, hanging down his head. [...] "I fear my book-learning was {{neglected}} at home, sir. My brother had read every book that ever was wrote, I think. He could have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about 'em <b>for</b> hours together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Mrs. Poyser, {{rising and}} walking towards the door, [...] "I know it 'ud {{be just the}} same if I was to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> hours. You'd make me the same answer, at th' end. I might as well talk to the running brook and tell it to stan' still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{my young}} friend," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you have brought news? Sit down. This is a busy morning. We have had large {{shipments}} from Germany. I have appointments with buyers {{most of the}} day, yet I can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a little time. You were at the ball last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, when we don't know {{a word of}} the language," [...] added Mr. George, [...] "we cannot {{have any}} {{communication}} {{with the people of}} the country, but shall be confined entirely to each other. Now, {{do you think that you}} could get along with having nobody but me to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a whole fortnight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you hear}} me now?... Ay and another little matter! I {{might as well be}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the wall as <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Understand once <b>for</b> all that <b>you</b> get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. How many courses do you want, I'd like <b>to</b> know.... Do <b>you</b> mind me now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|With little {{here to do}} or see [...] Of {{things that}} in the great world be, [...] Daisy! again I <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> [1] [...] <b>For</b> thou art worthy, [...] Thou unassuming Common-place [...] 5 [...] Of Nature, with that homely face, [...] And yet with {{something}} of a grace, [...] Which Love makes <b>for</b> <b>thee!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something to me! Egad, I {{forget what}} <b>you</b> said <b>to</b> me, {{or whether you}} said anything. Oh no! you weren't so bad as that; but <b>you</b> were going <b>to</b> eat Ussher about something. But never mind that now; don't get tipsy again, {{if you can help}} it, and that's all about it. It's not the {{drinking}} I'm come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about; <b>for</b> you're no drunkard, Thady; and indeed it's not as your priest I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at all, but as one friend to another. And now, my dear boy, will you take what I've to say in good part?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} unless you like, of course," [...] he went on, [...] "but I wish to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{a few moments}} and I {{thought that it would}} be more {{convenient}} if I addressed you by name. I do not remember to have heard it mentioned at Blenheim House, and Mrs. Lawrence, as you know, does not introduce her guests." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned and}} walked to the wood-box, and after glancing into it {{carefully}} straightened out its covering. Then he strode towards the door, and stopped a moment before he opened it. [...] "Excuse!" [...] he said simply. [...] "No, don't you worry; I know just where the saw and lantern are, and Charley, who comes from the old country, can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{a year of}} all {{the pretty}} kindnesses that she would do for me; how, when she found me of early mornings among my books, her {{presence}} [...] "would cast a light upon the day;" [...] how she used to smooth and fold my little surplice, and embroider me caps and gowns for high feast-days; how she used to bring flowers for the altar, and who could deck it so well as she? But sentiment does not come glibly from under a grizzled moustache, so I will drop it, if you please.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lawrence," [...] she said, [...] "I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> seriously <b>for</b> one minute. <b>You</b> are too {{conscientious}} for a politician. Don't let the same vice spoil our friendship! Certain things <b>you</b> owe <b>to</b> your wife. Mind, I admit that, though from some {{points of view}} even that might be disputed. But you also owe me certain things--and I mean to be paid. I won't be avoided, mind. I {{want to be treated}} as a very close--and dear--companion--and--kiss me once more, Lawrence, and then we'll begin," [...] she wound up, with a little sob in her throat.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, I do {{not blame}} you. It {{was the most}} natural thing in the world. I should have looked upon anyone as a madman who had <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> me as I have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But <b>for</b> all that, Robert, you were wrong, and I have never yet in our conversations {{proposed}} any scheme which it was not well within my power to carry out. I tell you in all sober earnest that the amount of my income is limited only by my desire, and that all the bankers and financiers combined could not furnish the sums which I can put forward without an effort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, I cannot stop <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now, <b>for</b> I am {{on my way}} to the Tower on business. I am {{only over}} from Holland for a day or two with despatches from the Earl to Her Majesty's Council, and am lodging at Westminster in a house that faces the abbey. It is one of my cousin Edward's houses, and you will see the Vere {{cognizance}} over the door. Call there at one hour after noon, and I will have a talk with you; but do not buoy yourselves up with hopes as to your going with me." [...] So saying, with a friendly nod of his head Francis Vere continued his way eastward.|$|R
