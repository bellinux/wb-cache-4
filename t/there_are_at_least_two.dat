5|$|During {{a typical}} game {{the number of}} {{officials}} can range from one to three, depending on the league and level of play.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> {{different}} dependent glyphs {{used for}} {{the concept of a}} guiding star. The generic Polynesian term is Ihu-ku (Hawaiian) which translates to “standing above the bow”. This concept is associated with the ‘phallic’ dependent glyph. For a specific guiding star used to make landfall on an island, the Polynesian term is hoku ai’aina, which is translated to “stars which ate, ruled the land”. This concept is referred to with the ‘hand’ dependent glyph.|$|E
5|$|The Chiroptera {{as a whole}} are in {{the process}} of losing the ability to {{synthesize}} vitamin C: most have lost it completely. In a test of 34 bat species from six major families of bats, including major insect- and fruit-eating bat families, all were found to have lost the ability to synthesize it, and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor, as a single mutation. Earlier reports of only fruit bats being deficient were based on smaller samples. However, recent results show that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> species of bat, the frugivorous bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) and insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger), that have retained their ability to produce vitamin C.|$|E

5|$|The {{step from}} rationals to reals {{is a major}} extension. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> popular ways to achieve this step, both {{published}} in 1872: Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern trend {{for the last few}} decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when a construction is offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more self-contained.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> major rock {{formations}} in the watershed of Little Fishing Creek: the Chemung Formation and the Hamilton Group. The creek's watershed includes {{part of the}} Greenwood Valley. Much of the watershed is forested and major roads in it include Pennsylvania Route 42. The first European settler first arrived {{in the vicinity of}} the creek during the 1760s or 1770s, with other settlers arriving in the 1790s. A number of sawmills, woolen mills, and tanneries historically operated on the creek. A number of covered bridges have also been built over it and there were historically some railroads in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|When Thayer left, his brother-in-law, S. W. Chandler {{took over}} the {{business}} in late 1853. so a seventh edition was needed {{by the beginning of}} 1854. Two new litho stones were made. Chandler printed black using one stone and green with the other. The endspace was changed back to a green circle. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> known copies of the Chandler edition, one was owned by deceased game historian Lee Dennis.

5|$|The {{university}} logo, the upheld torch, {{is derived}} from the Statue of Liberty, signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and design firm Chermayeff & Geismar. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> versions of the possible origin of the university color, violet. Some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, the center of learning in ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|The first goaltender {{credited}} with an {{assist in the}} NHL was Georges Vezina in the 1917–18 season, after a puck rebounded off his leg pad to a teammate who skated {{the length of the}} ice to score. In the 1935–36 season, Tiny Thompson became the first goaltender to gain an assist after making an intentional pass. During the Second World War, while playing for the All-Star Canadian Army team, goaltender Chuck Rayner carried the puck down the ice and beat the opposing goaltender, Art Jones. In the NHL, he made numerous unsuccessful attempts to duplicate this feat; {{as a member of the}} New York Rangers, Rayner attempted to score both by aiming at an empty net and by rushing down the rink. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> recorded instances of him skating to the other side of the ice after making a save, and he was experimentally used on the point during power-plays in late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|In American football, if {{what would}} {{normally}} be a safety is scored on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), one point is awarded to the scoring team. This {{is commonly known as}} a conversion safety or one-point safety and it can be scored by the offense. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football– a November 26, 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State. In both games, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked, recovered by the defense, and then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone. Coincidentally, play-by-play commentator Brad Nessler of the ESPN family of networks (currently with CBS) called both of these games. No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940, although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt. Before 2015, the only scenario in which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball out the back of the end zone without taking possession of it. After the 2015 rule change, a one-point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it, as in the NCAA.|$|E
