50|$|A {{system was}} devised for {{transcription}} of the intonation {{of the material}} in the recordings, and two <b>transcribers,</b> Gerry Knowles and Briony Williams, analysed the entire corpus. The transcription system is explained by Williams, and an experiment was conducted by Brian Pickering to assess the degree of agreement between the two <b>transcribers</b> on {{a section of the}} Corpus containing around 1000 tone-units which was transcribed by both <b>transcribers.</b> Good agreement was found.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent work}} we {{compared}} transcriptions of German spontaneous dialogues of the VERBMOBIL corpus to ascertain differences between <b>transcribers</b> and quality. A {{better understanding of}} where {{and what kind of}} inconsistencies occur will help us to improve the working environment for <b>transcribers,</b> to reduce the effort on correction passes, and will finally result in better transcription quality. The results show that <b>transcribers</b> have different levels of perception of spontaneous speech phenomena, mainly prosodic phenomena such as pauses in speech and lengthening. During the correction pass 80 % of these labels had to be inserted. Additionally, the annotation of non-grammatical phrases and pronunciation comments seems to need a better explanation in the convention manual. Here the correcting <b>transcribers</b> had to change 20 % of the annotations. 1...|$|R

His father, Antonio Almodóvar, was a winemaker, and his mother, Francisca Caballero, who died in 1999, was a letter reader and <b>transcriber</b> for illiterate neighbours.|$|E
25|$|When Testimony was {{published}} in the West in 1979, Shostakovich's overall anti-Stalinist tone and specific comments about the anti-totalitarian content hidden in the Fifth, Seventh and Eleventh Symphonies were held suspect initially. They were in some ways a complete about-face from the comments the West had received over the years, many times in the composer's words. Questions also arose over Solomon Volkov's role—to what degree he was a compiler of previously written material, a <b>transcriber</b> of the composer's actual words from interviews, or an author essentially putting words into the composer's mouth.|$|E

500|$|The 1925 {{edition of}} In Our Time is {{considered}} one of Hemingway's masterpieces. Reviewers and critics noticed, and the collection received positive reviews on its publication. The New York Times described the language as [...] "fibrous and athletic, colloquial and fresh, hard and clean, his very prose seems to have an organic being of its own". A reviewer for Time wrote, [...] "Ernest Hemingway is somebody; a new honest un-'literary' <b>transcriber</b> of life – a Writer." [...] Reviewing if for The Bookman, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote Hemingway was an [...] "augury" [...] of the age and that the Nick Adams stories were [...] "temperamentally new" [...] in American fiction.|$|E
500|$|According to Bentley this {{manuscript}} is [...] "the oldest and {{best in the}} world". Bentley assumed that by supplementing {{this manuscript}} with readings from other manuscripts and from the Latin Vulgate, he could triangulate back to the single recension which he presumed existed {{at the time of}} the First Council of Nicaea. Wettstein highly esteemed the codex in 1730, but he changed his opinion in 1751 and was no longer a great admirer of it. He came to the conviction that Athos was the place of its origin, not Alexandria. Michaelis also did not esteem it highly, either on account of its internal excellence or the value of its readings. The principal charge which has been produced against the manuscript, and which had been urged by Wettstein, is its having been altered from the Latin version. Michaelis countered that the <b>transcriber</b> who lived in Egypt would not have altered the Greek text from a Latin version, because Egypt belonged to the Greek diocese, and Latin was not understood there. Woide, who defended the Greek manuscripts in general, and the Codex Alexandrinus in particular, from the charge of having been corrupted from the Latin, discerned two hands in the New Testament.|$|E

40|$|For the {{implementation}} of the prosody predic-tion model, large scale annotated speech corpo-ra have been widely applied. Reliability among <b>transcribers,</b> however, was too low for success-ful learning of an automatic prosodic prediction. This paper reveals our observations on perfor-mance deterioration of the learning model due to inconsistent tagging of prosodic breaks in the established corpora. Then, we suggest a method for consistent prosodic labeling among multiple <b>transcribers.</b> As a result, we obtain a corpus with consistent annotation of prosodic breaks. The estimated pairwise agreement of annotation of the main corpus is between 0. 7477 and 0. 7916, and the value of K is between 0. 7057 and 0. 7569. Considering the estimated K, anno-tation of the main corpus has reliable consisten-cy among multiple <b>transcribers.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{contraction}} rules {{take into}} account the linguistic structure of the word; thus, contractions are generally not to be used when their use would alter the usual braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added.

Working in medical transcription leads to a mastery in medical terminology and editing, ability to listen and type simultaneously, utilization of playback controls on the <b>transcriber</b> (machine), and use of foot [...] to play and adjust dictations – all while maintaining a steady rhythm of execution. Medical transcription training normally includes coursework in medical terminology, anatomy, editing, grammar and punctuation, typing, medical record types and formats, and healthcare documentation.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{based on}} Smith's other {{statements}} that the angel was [...] "Moroni," [...] {{and based on}} both prior and later publications, most Latter Day Saints view Smith's 1838 identification of the angel as Nephi as a mistake, perhaps {{on the part of}} the <b>transcriber</b> or a later editor. In the version of Smith's 1838 history published by the LDS Church, as well as the portion canonized by that denomination as the Pearl of Great Price, the name [...] "Nephi" [...] has been changed by editors to read [...] "Moroni".

2500|$|In 1969 Warren B. Austin {{undertook}} a pioneering computer-aided {{analysis of the}} work of Chettle and Greene.

Austin's analysis convinced many scholars, but in 2006 Richard Westley came to the opposite conclusion, accusing Austin of pre-selecting evidence to support his view. Westley concluded that the pamphlet was the work of Greene and that the evidence of Chettle's quirks was the result of his role as a <b>transcriber.</b> Steve Mentz, writing in 2008, argued that Groatsworth included a substantial amount of material written by Greene, but that its idiosyncratic structure suggested that there was significant editorial intervention in the source material creating [...] "an unusual sort of collaboration" [...] between Chettle and Greene.|$|E
