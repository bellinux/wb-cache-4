40|$|While {{the storage}} of {{hydrogen}} for portable and stationary applications is regarded as critical in bringing PEM fuel cells to commercial acceptance, little is known of the environmental exposure risks posed in utilizing condensed phase chemical storage options as in complex hydrides. It is thus {{important to understand the}} effect of environmental exposure of metal hydrides in the case of accident scenarios. Simulated tests were performed following the United Nations standards to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>flammability</b> and water reactivity in air for a destabilized lithium borohydride and magnesium hydride system in a 2 to 1 molar ratio respectively. It was determined that the mixture acted similarly to the parent, lithium borohydride, but at slower rate of reaction seen in magnesium hydride. To quantify environmental exposure kinetics, isothermal calorimetry was utilized to measure the enthalpy of reaction as a function of exposure time to dry and humid air, and liquid water. The reaction with liquid water was found to increase the heat flow significantly during exposure compared to exposure in dry or humid air environments. Calorimetric results showed the maximum normalized heat flow the fully charged material was 6 mW/mg under liquid phase hydrolysis; and 14 mW/mg for the fully discharged material also occurring under liquid phase hydrolysis conditions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new test}} method has been {{developed}} to investigate the flamma-bility of trimmings used on soft furnishings. The trimming was attached to a sam-ple of the soft furnishing fabric by steel pins. The trimming/fabric combination was then fixed on a specially designed steel frame that could be slotted on to the BS 5438 : 1976 test rig. The frame supporting the trimming could be rotated along the vertical plane so that the trimming/fabric junction could be inclined at vari-ous angles {{with respect to the}} flame. It was found that the rate of propagation of the flame across the length of the trimming was dependant on fibre type and the angle of alignment. The transfer of flame from trimming to the host fabric also de-pended on the fibre type of both the trimming and the host fabric. It may be possi-ble to use this method to assess the flammability of the trimmings attached to upholstered furniture, using a small flame, where by all types of trimming (cords, cut ruche, fringes) could be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>flammability</b> and flame transfer at various degrees of alignment, e. g., horizontal, vertical, etc...|$|R

40|$|Microgravity {{tests of}} {{flammability}} and flame spread were {{performed in a}} low-speed flow tunnel to simulate spacecraft ventilation flows. Three thin fuels were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>flammability</b> (Ultem 1000 (General Electric Company), 10 mil film, Nomex (Dupont) HT 90 - 40, and Mylar G (Dupont) and one fuel <b>for</b> flame spread <b>testing</b> (Kimwipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.). The 1 g Upward Limiting Oxygen Index (ULOI) and 1 g Maximum Oxygen Concentration (MOC) {{are found to be}} greater than those in 0 g, by up to 4 % oxygen mole fraction, meaning that the fuels burned in 0 g at lower oxygen concentrations than they did using the NASA Standard 6001 Test 1 protocol. Flame spread tests with Kimwipes were used to develop correlations that capture the effects of flow velocity, oxygen concentration, and pressure on flame spread rate. These correlations were used to determine that over virtually the entire range of spacecraft atmospheres and flow conditions, the opposed spread is faster, especially for normoxic atmospheres. The correlations were also compared with 1 g MOC for various materials as a function of pressure and oxygen. The lines of constant opposed flow agreed best with the 1 g MOC trends, which indicates that Test 1 limits are essentially dictated by the critical heat flux for ignition. Further evaluation of these and other materials is continuing to better understand the 0 g flammability of materials and its effect on the oxygen margin of safety...|$|R

This work addresses these needs by applying the fundamental knowledge gained from low stretch experiments {{to the development of}} a normal gravity low stretch material flammability test method. The concept of the apparatus being developed uses the low stretch geometry to simulate the conditions of the extraterrestrial environment through proper scaling of the sample dimensions to reduce the buoyant stretch in normal gravity. The apparatus uses controlled forced-air flow to augment the low stretch to levels which simulate Lunar or Martian gravity levels. In addition, the effect of imposed radiant heat flux on material flammability can be studied with the cone heater.

40|$|Experimental work on {{the effects}} of heat flux, oxygen {{concentration}} and glass fiber volume fraction on pyrolysate mass flux from samples of polypropylene/glass fiber composite (PP/G) is underway. The research is conducted {{as part of a larger}} project to develop a <b>test</b> methodology <b>for</b> <b>flammability</b> of materials, particularly composites, in the microgravity and variable oxygen concentration environment of spacecraft and space structures. Samples of PP/G sized at 30 x 30 x 10 mm are flush mounted in a flow tunnel, which provides a flow of oxidizer over the surface of the samples at a fixed value of 1 m/s and oxygen concentrations varying between 18 and 30 %. Each sample is exposed to a constant external radiant heat flux at a given value, which varies between tests from 10 to 24 kW/m 2. Continuous sample mass loss and surface temperature measurements are recorded <b>for</b> each <b>test.</b> Some tests are conducted with an igniter and some are not. In the former case, the research goal is to quantify the critical mass flux at ignition for the various environmental and material conditions described above. The later case generates a wider range of mass flux rates than those seen prior to ignition, providing an opportunity to examine the protective effects of blowing on oxidative pyrolysis and heating of the surface. Graphs of surface temperature and sample mass loss vs. time for samples of 30 % PPG at oxygen concentrations of 18 and 21 % are presented in the figures below. These figures give a clear indication of the lower pyrolysis rate and extended time to ignition that accompany a lower oxygen concentration. Analysis of the mass flux rate at the time of ignition gives good repeatability but requires further work to provide a clear indication of mass flux trends accompanying changes in environmental and material properties...|$|R

The tests will be fully automated with the data downlinked {{at the conclusion of the}} test before the Cygnus vehicle re-enters the atmosphere. The unmanned, pressurized environment in the Saffire experiments allows for the largest sample sizes ever to be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> material <b>flammability</b> in microgravity, which will be based on the characteristics of flame spread over the surface of the combustible material. Furthermore, the experiments will have a duration that is unmatched in scale compared to earth based microgravity research facilities such as drop towers (about 5 seconds) and parabolic flights (about 20 seconds). In contrast to sounding rockets, the experiments offer a much larger volume, and the reduction in the oxygen concentration during the Saffire experiments will be minimal. The selection of the experimental settings for the first three Saffire experiments has been based on existing knowledge of scenarios that are relevant, yet challenging, for a spacecraft environment. Given that there is always airflow in the space station, all the experiments are conducted with flame spread in either concurrent or opposed flow, though with the flow being stopped in some tests, to simulate the alarm mode environment in the ISS and thereby also to study extinguishment. The materials have been selected based on their known performance in NASA STD- 6001 Test- 1, and with different materials being classified as charring, thermally thin, and thermally thick.

The paper compares data from ignition tests conducted in the Cone Calorimeter and the FIST apparatus with tests conducted using the FMVSS 302 horizontal flame spread apparatus. Ten materials were selected as representative of those used as seat coverings of private and commercial passenger vehicles. The time to ignition of new and used materials subject to exposure heat fluxes between 20 kW/m 2 and 40 kW/m 2 was measured. The results from the ignition tests were analyzed using thermally thick and thermally thin theoretical models. The critical heat flux for sustained piloted ignition was determined from the time to ignition data using the thermally thin approach. Derived ignition temperatures from both the thermally thick and thermally thin methods were compared with measurements using a thermocouple attached to the back surface of materials in selected tests. The flame spread rates in the FMVSS 302 apparatus were determined and a comparison was made between the performance of the materials in the flame spread apparatus, the Cone Calorimeter and the FIST. The results suggests that a critical heat flux criterion could be used to provide an equivalent pass/fail performance requirement to that specified by the horizontal flame spread test although further testing is needed to support this...|$|R

Best Practice: This best practice describes various steps and precautions for minimizing/eliminating recycled rubber combustion and flammability. All automotive rubber products such as hose, mats, and belts must meet FMVSS 302 standards. Other specifications that rubbery material must meet are UL 94, ASTM D 470, C 542 and C 864. The release of volatiles upon burning rubber is of concern. ASTM D 4205 - 93 describes <b>test</b> methods <b>for</b> determining <b>flammability</b> and combustion properties of rubbery materials. A copy is attached. Implementation: Process and store materials at ambient temperatures. Avoid build-up of static electricity which may cause combustion. All processing and storage areas should be strictly “non-smoking. ” Recycled rubber handlers need to have information on volatility of the material from MSDSs. A copy of a MSDS, as an example, is attached in the Material Storage Best Practice. It is best to avoid static build-up during shredding, grinding, and sorting steps. This is achieved by properly grounding processing equipment. Appendix I lists comparative Btu valves of TCF (tire-chip fuel) and TDF (tire-derived fuel) to give an idea regarding the extent of heat generated during the burning of these materials.
