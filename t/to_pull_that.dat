5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
25|$|Director Victor Lobl also planned out the mannerisms {{shown by}} Brooks as Sisko where he talks {{directly}} to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described. All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity {{to ensure that the}} audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.|$|E

Sebastian told Callaway: [...] "You've {{got to have the}} right attitude to this competition, you've got to be focused and to be honest, not be rude to people and have the work ethic. For you to not learn your lyrics and for you to at times be rude to crew, you really have <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> in and rein that in because you won't last long in this competition or this industry if you do that."

500|$|Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse, the game's main antagonist, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as an antagonist of Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and main antagonist of Wolfenstein (2009). For The New Order, the team achieved closure on his story; {{to do so in}} an effective way, they wanted to find an interesting angle to portray him: his personality is full of enthusiasm, and he appreciates life after his near-death experience in the previous game. When developing the Nazis, Matthies states that the team [...] "didn't want to cartoon-ify them", instead opting to treat them seriously. Gideon Emery, who portrayed Fergus Reid, auditioned {{for his role in the}} game. He described Fergus as [...] "a tough as nails soldier, who gives [...] both support and a pretty hard time in the process". Matthies felt that Fergus is a type of father figure to Blazkowicz, and that he [...] "only gives negative reinforcement". Conversely, he saw Wyatt as a [...] "sort of son surrogate", as Blazkowicz is tasked as being his protector and mentor, and that he gives [...] "positive reinforcement". Max Hass, a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance, was inspired by the character of Garp from John Irving's novel The World According to Garp. Alex Solowitz portrayed Max in the game. [...] "Max was the most challenging character to cast, which seems counter-intuitive because he's a pretty simple guy on paper, but it took a tremendous actor <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off and a long time to find him," [...] Matthies said.|$|E

2500|$|Nintendo was {{concerned}} that a CD-ROM drive would increase {{the cost of the}} console in a price-sensitive market. Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick said, [...] "We're very sensitive to the cost of the console.

We could get an eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, it would be hard <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off." [...] Describing the final choice of proprietary floppy disks instead of CD-ROM, Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained, [...] "CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [...] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres." ...|$|E
2500|$|WWE's storylines for Bryan {{since his}} return were widely criticized. Dave Scherer of Pro Wrestling Insider {{questioned}} [...] "bringing Bryan {{back for the}} Rumble in the first place" [...] {{if there was no}} intention of letting Bryan win. Benjamin Tucker of Pro Wrestling Torch criticized WWE for having [...] "watered down" [...] Bryan's babyface character to a [...] "sneaky, backstabbing, cheap, aggravating jerk" [...] for the feud against Roman Reigns. Mike Tedesco of WrestleView wrote in March that WWE [...] "killed Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton dead in the last two months. It takes a special bunch of nincompoops <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off". Jake Barnett of Pro Wrestling Dot Net said that Bryan being labelled a 'turd' was [...] "asking fans to disbelieve what they see with their own eyes" [...] and [...] "will do nothing to calm down the conspiracy theorists who insist WWE is intentionally cooling off Bryan to make Reigns look better in comparison". In a piece for the Wrestling Observer, Zach Dominello was [...] "dumbfounded and disheartened" [...] that [...] "after returning from a very serious injury, WWE’s bright idea is to put Bryan {{in one of the most}} dangerous matches possible at WrestleMania", while having [...] "dragged Bryan down to the levels of R-Truth and Stardust".|$|E
2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Michael Weaver {{said that}} [...] "Since 2008, the band has {{undergone}} extensive line-up changes {{that has left}} only singer Kevin Young as the sole original member still standing. Despite these changes, Disciple has continued to release solid hard rock records. Their newest effort, O God Save Us All, is no exception, but is, however, {{a bit of a}} mixed bag. Half of the record feels like the energizing hard rock found of their self-titled album, as well as Scars Remain, while the other half feels more like the same modern rock heard all over the radio. Thankfully, Disciple is able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> radio rock sound off better than most." [...] Weaver concluded with saying [...] "Kevin Young's current Disciple doesn't necessarily hit it out of the park, but they do manage to maintain the norm. When the norm is crafting solid rock records with great replay value, 'maintaining the norm' isn't such a bad thing; it's no wonder Disciple has been around so long...Fans of harder rock than typically played on the radio, and fans of radio rock alike, can find common ground on this record. O God Save Us All probably won't end up as the favorite album of most fans, but it still contains plenty of material to whet your hard rock appetite." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cougar Town {{opened to}} mixed reviews from critics. Metacritic gave the series 49 out of 100 {{based on the}} pilot episode, from the 21 reviews it collected, and a user score of 4.5 out of 10 based on 46 votes. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot episode a B, commenting that the show mixes [...] "clinical realism (when did you last hear a C-section scar used as a punchline?) with ridiculous slang (a new boob job is {{referred}} to as gorilla heads), Cougar Town is so brashly vulgar, it's endearing". Tucker also wrote that [...] "the entire show is about getting and having sex... Cougar is so single-minded that this obsession itself becomes funny". Variety stated that the show [...] "does feed into the dual sense of insecurity and self-empowerment that women harbor about getting older ... though, the execution here is consistently about as subtle as a kick to the groin". Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara said that the [...] "maddening thing about Cougar Town is that it isn't completely unfunny or uncharming". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger feels that [...] "Cougar Town is still finding itself, but it's already much better than the title would suggest [...] the show [...] "has to walk a very careful line between making fun of the cougar concept and embracing it" [...] although based on the two episodes [...] "Cougar Town is self-aware enough <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off". USA Today was also favorable, saying that the show has [...] "the right cast and good writing".|$|E
