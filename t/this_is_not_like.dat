Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E

50|$|King Harihar Sen, the {{grandson}} of Lo Hang Sen, succeeded his grandfather to the throne of Morang. He extended Morang up to Gondwara in Bihar, gave himself the title of “Hindupati Maharaj”, and built a new palace in Chanjitpur in lower Morang. He placed his grandson Bidhata Indra Sen on the throne of Morang. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>liked</b> by Hahrihar Sen’s sons so civil war broke out. In this chaotic struggle, Subha Sen, younger son of King Harihar Sen, was victorious and started ruling Morang.|$|R

60|$|We have {{to break}} away, back to the great unison of manhood in some passionate purpose. Now <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> sex. Sex is always individual. A man has his own sex: nobody else's. And sexually he goes as a single individual; he can mingle only singly. So that to make sex a general affair is just a {{perversion}} and a lie. You can't get people {{and talk to them}} about their sex, {{as if it were a}} common interest.|$|E
50|$|Giuseppe Verrazano, who {{was with}} the Morello gang, wanted to open up another {{gambling}} house; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>liked</b> by the Navy Street gang so a plot to kill him was hatched. Verrazano spotted a Navy Street member and tried to kill him, but he was spotted and forced to flee. Many assassinations and attempts happened after this, making neither side safe. Since the Camorra could not kill the new leaders, their plot for destruction {{would have to be}} executed indirectly. The Camorra tried to wrest artichoke business from Ciro Terronova. Their threats failed not only against artichokes but coal, ice, and other markets.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the hostility}} of the Raja of Sonda, the factory was closed in 1720 and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> reopened until 1750. War {{broke out in}} the {{meanwhile}} between the Portuguese and the Raja of Sonda. The Raja of Sonda had helped the English establish a factory in Karwar. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>liked</b> by the Portuguese. In May 1752 the Portuguese sent a fleet and captured the Sonda fort, Sadashivgad but was given back on restoration of peace when the Portuguese were allowed to build a fort at Bhatkal. The Portuguese claimed the monopoly of the Karwar trade and as they were in a position to enforce their claim, the English agent was withdrawn.|$|R

And then not to find him at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone.

60|$|It {{is proper}} {{in this place}} to mention a short philosophic piece which Diderot wrote in 1751, his Letter on the Deaf and Dumb for the Use of those who Hear and Talk. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>like</b> the Letter on the Blind, the {{examination}} of {{a case of the}} Intellect deprived of {{one or more of the}} senses. It is substantially a fragment, and a very important fragment, on Æsthetics, and as such there will be something to say about it in another chapter. But there are, perhaps, one or two points at which the Letter on the Deaf and Dumb touches the line of thought of the Letter on the Blind.|$|E
50|$|Shivaji (Prabhas) and Ashok (Shafi) are {{the sons}} of Parvati (Bhanupriya). Shivaji is her stepson, but Parvati shows equal affection on both of them, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>liked</b> by Ashok, who is her {{biological}} son. They {{are one of the}} families living on the coast of Sri Lanka. One day, these villagers are forced to evacuate the coast. By Ashok's dislike on Shivaji, he lies to his mother that Shivaji died in the fire that was burning everything. Then, he is separated from his family. He ends up in a different boat and lands in Vizag port. He is brought up in the port itself, but his search for his mother never ceases. In that process he comes across Neelu (Shriya).|$|R
50|$|The machine {{had only}} a few notable features. One was the use of a TV as the display system, whereas many {{machines}} had no display at all. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the displays of later machines, however; text was displayed at 60 characters per second. However, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> still faster than the teleprinters used on contemporary machines of that era. The Apple I also included bootstrap code on ROM, which made it easier to start up. Finally, at the insistence of Paul Terrell, Wozniak also designed a cassette interface for loading and saving programs, at the then-rapid pace of 1200 bit/s. Although the machine was fairly simple, it was nevertheless a masterpiece of design, using far fewer parts than anything in its class, and quickly earning Wozniak a reputation as a master designer.|$|R

She strove {{to reduce the}} {{ordinary}} expenditure, but Arthur had a fashion of bringing home a friend to dinner without notice; and she underwent indescribable miseries, while reflecting on her one chicken, or five mutton chops; and though something was sure to be extemporized by the cook, {{the result was that}} these casual guests were as expensive as a banquet. She ventured to beg Arthur to tell her when he was going to ask any one, but he was vexed, and said he liked to bring home a man by chance; there need be nothing out of the common way, and a dinner for two was a dinner for three. Poor Violet thought, 'Ah! <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the time at Winchester. It is my own fault, I am not companion, enough.' ...|$|E

Ah, if HE, my boy, my Alexander, were still a child, I might warm this cold, cold heart in his sunshine! Strange that I cannot reconstruct from this dutiful, submissive, obedient, industrious Alexander,--this redeemed outcast, this son who shares my life, my fortunes, my heart,--the foolish, wilful, thoughtless, idle boy, that once defied me. I remember (musing, with a smile) how the little rascal, ha, ha! once struck me,--STRUCK ME!--when I corrected him: ha, ha!

Why should I find fault with him for being all that a righteous conversion demands,--all that I asked and prayed for? No, Alexander Morton: it is you, YOU, who are not yet regenerate.

Duke Ferdinand perceives that he is come to nothing; hastily collects his people from their various posts; retreats with them that same night, unpursued, to Heilbronn; and gives up the command to Prince Eugene, who is just arrived there,--who took quietly two pinches of snuff on hearing this news of Ettlingen, and said, [...] "No matter, after all!" ...|$|E

Earlier in the year, Major General Brij Mohan Kaul was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Defence Minister Menon against the recommendation of Thimayya. This incident had led to Thimayya's resignation. Within no time, Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS.
