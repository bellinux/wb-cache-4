500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it for them." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 13, 2017, Rodman {{returned}} to North Korea {{on what was}} initially described as a sports-related visit to the country. [...] "My purpose is {{to go over there}} and try <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep bringing sports to North Korea," [...] Rodman said. He added that he hoped to accomplish [...] "something that's pretty positive." [...] During the visit, Rodman met with national Olympic athletes, male and female basketball players, viewed a men's basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage.

500|$|In 1945, Tracy {{returned}} to {{the stage for the}} first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night... At least every day is a new day for me in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E

500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} the [...] "Steven Meisel-shot cover... was as key to her reinvention as {{the music of the}} album itself." [...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bloom was a {{huge hit}} {{becoming}} (in 1999) the only album of the band to be certified gold by RIAA. It also marked guitarist Blair's final album, who {{decided to become a}} music producer. In a 2015 interview with Breathecast, Blair talked about his reasons to leave citing his love of [...] "the creative part of writing, recording, being in the studio, putting songs together" [...] as the main factor. In the interview, he refers to the Bloom album as something he was [...] "exceptionally proud of", and how he knew he was creating something that had [...] "meaning and will touch people". Blair also added how his interest started {{to move away from the}} touring aspect until he [...] "decided to make the jump <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> sink or swim as a producer".|$|E
2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
