5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>if</b> the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2009, the {{battalion}} was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment.

5|$|The Special Air Service Regiment {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the RAR. Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957, in 1960 {{it became an}} independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army's special operations capability. The SASR became a regiment {{in its own right}} on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia's national interests. Once full operational capability was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in Timor Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>if</b> required.|$|E

However, such airports often suffer of major delays and chaos at their schedules. Oslo had 234,974 movements against 474,087 at Heathrow in 2015. Former Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete (Center), has stated that spreading the traffic between the two airports (RYG is closed on permanent basis) will result in inconvenience for passengers and a massive need for inter-airport ground transportation, but has announced she is opposed to a third runway. Avinor is facing large costs of extending short runways in rural locations or replacing such airports during the 2020 decade, so a third runway at Oslo is less prioritized.|$|E

The game was not released for the Wii U or the personal computer market, with product manager Daniel Sussman stating that two issues that would limit a personal computer version is existing music availability, and the lack of security for the specific music tracks which the PlayStation and Xbox consoles already possess.

25|$|Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? is a 1956 book by the {{psychoanalyst}} Edmund Bergler, {{in which}} the author argues that homosexuality is a curable illness. Bergler denies that homosexuality is caused by hormonal or other biological factors, the Oedipus complex, or having a dominant mother and a weak or absent father, instead attributing {{both male and female}} homosexuality to pre-Oedipal factors involving an unsolved masochistic conflict with the mother during the earliest period of infancy. According to Bergler, homosexuality in men reflects unconscious fear and hatred of women. Bergler argues that there are several different types of homosexuality, each with a distinct clinical profile. Bergler rejects the existence of bisexuality, maintaining that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, and criticizes the work of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. He characterizes homosexual men as sexually promiscuous, and argues that this promiscuity is a result of their unsatisfying sex lives and masochistic craving for danger. Bergler argues against immediately repealing laws against homosexuality, though he suggests that such laws could perhaps be repealed in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>if</b> other measures against homosexuality proved effective. Bergler proposes the publicizing of his ideas as a measure against homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>If</b> civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene.
