5|$|Kia Motors {{collaborated with}} 20th Century Fox {{to promote the}} home media release of the film with a Wolverine-themed Sorento. <b>The</b> <b>SUV</b> made its debut at the 2015 Australian Open, {{with a series of}} videos {{featuring}} Rafael Nadal teaming up with the X-Men to save the tennis event from the Sentinels.|$|E
5|$|Producers Avery Drewe and Richie Owens {{coordinated the}} visual effects {{during the final}} scene of the episode and were only able to do one take during filming. Stunt driver Steve Kelso drove <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> when it crashed into Tony's car, {{reportedly}} driving at 50 miles per hour, though bloggers indicated that they thought that the car looked more {{like it was going}} 80 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|A second {{accident}} {{occurred on}} October 11, 2010, in Washington, D.C. While filming a chase scene at 3rd Street and Maryland Avenue, SW, a Metropolitan Police K9 Unit SUV accidentally rammed the Camaro that portrays Bumblebee in the film. The area {{had been closed}} off by the Washington, D.C., police, and it is unclear why <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> was there. Both drivers were uninjured, but the Camaro was severely damaged.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>SUVs</b> {{obtained}} from <b>the</b> liver during steroid therapy {{were significantly higher}} than those of the pre-therapy scan, whereas <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> from DA were not altered by steroid therapy.|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{whether there was}} a correlation between <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> and glucose levels, a Pearson product-moment correlation analysis was conducted on <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> at equilibrium (i.e. the sum of the last five frames) versus both the pre- and post-scan glucose levels. In the conscious case, the correlation coefficients were − 0.19 and − 0.28 for the pre- and post-scan glucose level, respectively (indicating no correlation) and in the unconscious case they were 0.62 and 0.53 for the pre- and post-scan glucose level, respectively. However, the p values for these fits were higher than 0.05 and therefore there is insufficient evidence to conclude that a correlation exists between <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> and <b>the</b> glucose levels.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy <b>the</b> <b>SUV,</b> citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out of the}} hospital, Johnny Sack's {{daughter}} gets {{married and}} the Soprano family attends. There, Tony is shown very exhausted when taking off his shoes through security. In the process, he collapses to the ground, but is not hurt. Before the wedding, Johnny Sack is approved to leave prison for six hours to see his daughter get married, but {{has to pay for}} the metal detectors and the presence of the U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about to drive away, <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> that was escorting Johnny to the wedding blocks the car from leaving and an altercation begins in the driveway. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny Sack cries as he is put back into handcuffs and driven back to prison, greatly diminishing the respect his crew and Tony's crew have for him.|$|E
5|$|Bueno's {{schedule}} at {{the time}} included twenty-five to thirty shows weekly. Due to his demanding tours, Bueno began consuming beer to excess, which began to interfere with his performing. His stress level was further increased from receiving multiple death threats. Following a concert at the nightclub Escándalo in La Plata, Bueno was returning {{to the city of}} Buenos Aires on the evening of June 24, 2000. After his path was blocked by another driver who had passed him on the turnpike, Bueno tried to chase the vehicle to move in front of it again. In the process, he lost control of his SUV and crashed against a barrier. He was ejected from <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> and he died instantly. His death caused an immediate sensation in the Argentine media, with speculation about a possible murder conspiracy. After a short trial, the driver of the other vehicle was found not guilty; the judge considered Bueno to have been responsible for driving imprudently.|$|E

5|$|When {{the gunmen}} {{stop at a}} restaurant, Lou phones the police. They arrive and {{exchange}} gunfire. One suspect is killed while the other manages to escape in his SUV. The police give chase with Lou and Rick tailing and recording. After the gunman's SUV crashes, Lou urges Rick to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Rick through the glass and tries to escape but is shot by police. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who has leverage over him. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates {{a story about the}} men in <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying, but cannot prove it. Lou hires a team of interns and buys new vans to expand his business.|$|E
25|$|Officers then {{fired on}} <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> as Malik {{continued}} {{to shoot at}} them. During this exchange of gunfire, a second police officer was wounded. Using a police cruiser as cover, officers fired {{into the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> while rescuing the wounded officer and a second one. At 3:14:53p.m., Malik was killed by several bullets that struck her in the body and head.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} fake explosivea metal pipe stuffed with cloth made to {{resemble}} a pipe bombwas thrown at the police during the pursuit. <b>The</b> <b>SUV</b> exited the freeway onto North Tippecanoe Avenue and briefly stopped at a stoplight, where a pursuing officer observed the perpetrators putting on tactical vests and equipping themselves with rifles. <b>The</b> <b>SUV</b> then continued onward onto East San Bernardino Avenue and entered a suburban area, where the shooter in the backseat, identified as Malik, began firing at police through the back window at 3:08:43p.m.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>SUVs</b> in <b>the</b> {{pancreas}} {{reached their}} plateau from 6.5 to 11 min after the MET injection, {{and in the}} brain, lung, and myocardium, they reached their plateau from 19.6 to 24.1 min. The MET uptake in the spleen and kidney peaked early after the injection and steadily decreased thereafter. <b>The</b> <b>SUVs</b> in <b>the</b> liver and stomach wall rapidly increased during the first 0 to 4.5 min and gradually elevated thereafter during the scan period. Urinary radioactivity in the bladder reached its plateau from 26.1 to 30.6 min after the MET injection. There were no correlations between the plasma concentrations of NAAs and <b>the</b> maximal <b>SUV</b> in any organs.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 22 May 2014, two sport utility {{vehicles}} (SUVs) carrying five assailants were driven into a busy street market in Ürümqi, the capital of China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Up to a dozen explosives were thrown at shoppers from the windows of <b>the</b> <b>SUVs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>SUVs</b> crashed into shoppers then collided {{with each other and}} exploded. 43 people were killed, including 4 of the assailants, and more than 90 wounded, making this the deadliest attack of the Xinjiang conflict.|$|R

25|$|Since grade-crossing {{accidents}} {{typically do}} {{not lead to}} fatalities on board the train, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were particularly interested in determining why the fatalities occurred. They believed that fuel from <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> may have combined with sparks from the dislodged third rail to cause a fire on board the train. They were interested in finding out how <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> driver got into the position she did in the first place; the detour caused by the earlier road accident may also have played a role.|$|E
25|$|Awards {{won by the}} first-generation Lexus RX include most {{appealing}} luxury SUV by J.D.

25|$|As the {{men were}} {{returning}} to the vehicle, the signal was given for the arrest. An 18-wheel New York City Police Department vehicle blocked {{the end of the}} street. The FBI informer also served as the driver of the suspects' vehicle. Another armored vehicle arrived, and officers from the department's Emergency Service Unit smashed the blackened windows of <b>the</b> <b>S.U.V.,</b> removed the men from the vehicle, and handcuffed them on the ground. None offered resistance.|$|E
25|$|It {{was heavily}} rumored by Japanese media, in 1992 and 1993, that Mitsubishi Motors {{intended}} a hostile acquisition of Honda. While Mitsubishi was riding high off of profitable vehicles {{such as the}} Diamante and Pajero, Honda was caught off-guard with <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> and truck boom and was losing focus after the illness and later death of its founder. However, Honda CEO Nobuhiko Kawamoto took drastic steps, such as exiting Formula 1 and discontinuing unprofitable vehicles to avert a Mitsubishi takeover, which proved effective.|$|E
25|$|While {{shooting}} {{on location in}} Mesa, Berg {{was involved in a}} fatal accident that resulted in the death of another member of the production team. <b>The</b> <b>SUV</b> he was riding in collided with a John Deere Gator all-terrain vehicle driven by Nick Papac. Papac died three hours later. On August 8, 2008, Papac's parents Michael Papac and Michele Bell filed a lawsuit against the director, a driver, and the production company. The lawsuit was dropped in 2008. Filming resumed one day after the incident.|$|E
30|$|A {{variety of}} methods have been {{proposed}} to define tumor VOI, but no reference standard has been accepted. Commonly used approaches for quantitative analysis of 18 F-FDG-PET images include the following: 1) measuring {{the value of the}} voxel with the highest activity within the tumor (SUVmax) [9],[10], 2) averaging <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> from <b>the</b> voxels inside the whole tumor defined by freehand outline of tumor boundaries (SUVmean) [11]-[13], 3) averaging the voxels with <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> greater than a certain percentage of SUVmax using thresholding techniques (SUVthreshold) [7],[14],[15], or 4) using fixed volume (SUVfixed volume) defined as <b>the</b> average <b>SUV</b> within a fixed-size VOI centered over a region with high metabolic activity without conforming to the precise tumor outline. A similar concept of SUVfixed volume has been used by Boellaard et al. and was called SUVpeak[6].|$|R

25|$|According to Dunn's testimony, Davis {{threatened}} to kill him, then opened his car door and pointed {{what appeared to be}} a shotgun at him. Dunn, who had a concealed weapons permit, took a handgun out of his glove compartment and started firing at Davis' door, hitting him in the legs, lungs, and aorta. As <b>the</b> <b>SUV</b> backed up to evade his gunshots, Dunn opened his own door and continued firing at the car, later testifying that he still feared for his safety as well as that of Rouer, who was to return to the vehicle imminently.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the crash, Harlem Line service was {{suspended}} between Pleasantville and North White Plains. On the afternoon of February 4, the day after the incident, the NTSB gave permission for Metro-North crews to clear the site. Late in the afternoon of February 4, a 100-member crew cleared the vehicles, using a high-rail crane to remove <b>the</b> <b>SUV.</b> The train was towed to Metro-North's North White Plains yard after 6 P.M., and workers proceeded to repair the 450 feet of third rail. Metro-North service resumed on the morning of February 5, with delays of fifteen minutes for trains to slow down as they passed the site of the accident. Commerce Street reopened to car traffic on the afternoon of February 5.|$|E
30|$|In a patient-based analysis, <b>the</b> highest <b>SUV</b> in <b>the</b> bone metastases and {{degenerative}} changes {{groups for}} each patient was included for comparison.

30|$|All PET {{images were}} fused with the {{corresponding}} MR images to ensure an accurate anatomic {{identification of the}} tumor. For a semi-quantitative analysis, a 15 -mm circular region of interest (ROI) was drawn on three consecutive transaxial image planes covering the tumor. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and <b>the</b> mean <b>SUV</b> (SUVmean) of <b>the</b> lesion were calculated from the maximum/mean radioactivity concentration of the tumor ROIs between 25 to 45 min after injection. An ROI {{of the same size}} was used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> of <b>the</b> adjacent normal liver tissue in the same patient, and the tumor-to-liver (T/L) ratio was calculated by dividing <b>the</b> tumor <b>SUV</b> by <b>the</b> liver <b>SUV.</b> For patients who showed little or no lesion-related tracer uptake, the ROI was placed at the anatomical position of the lesion depicted on MR using direct visual alignment of both sets of images. If more than one lesion were positive, the lesion which showed the most intense uptake was chosen as representative of all lesions.|$|R
30|$|SUV {{body weight}} was {{selected}} for the analysis. Since <b>the</b> <b>SUVs</b> for vascular plaques may only differ marginally from normal uptake [4], a background ratio (the flowing blood within the jugular vein was used for this analysis) to use as an internal control was obtained.|$|R
