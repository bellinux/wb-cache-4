5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> <b>up</b> on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features {{that might have been}} related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
25|$|As in all Macronaria, the forelimbs of brachiosaurids {{are long}} {{relative}} to the hindlimbs, but this trait is more pronounced in brachiosaurids. The forelimbs were very slender for a sauropod and the metacarpal bones of the forelimb were elongated. These adaptations overall increased the stride length of the forelimbs, arguably resulting in an uneven gait. However, it was previously argued that they were hindlimb dominant like other sauropods, and thus had the ability <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> <b>up</b> on their hindlimbs. Based {{on the structure of}} their legs, making it impossible for them to run, it is likely that they moved about in a low walking speed (20–40km/day), but were capable of moving faster when necessary, up to 20–30km/hour, depending on leg length.|$|E

Having been the first junior to win the award in 1937, {{he became the first}} player to receive the award twice in 1938. Though line coach Anderson did not return in 1937, Michigan hired Clarence “Biggie” Munn to replace him. Munn was a unanimous All-American guard for Minnesota in 1931. Under the new coaching staff of Crisler and Munn, Heikkinen became one of the best college football players in the country. After the 1938 season, Heikkinen credited Crisler and Munn for his development. Heikkinen noted that Michigan linemen were taught not to depend on sheer strength. [...] "We have not been taught <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> <b>up</b> and hurl back the opposition. We have not been taught to roll it back by power.

500|$|Like all ornithischians, Kentrosaurus was a herbivore. The fodder {{was barely}} chewed and {{swallowed}} in large chunks.

With its centre of mass close to the hind-limbs, the animal could potentially support itself as it stood up. The hips were likely capable of allowing a vertical trunk rotation of about 60 degrees and the tail probably would either have been fully lifted, not blocking this movement or have enough curvature to rest on the ground; thus it could have provided additional support, though precisely because of this flexibility it is not certain whether much support was actually provided: it was not stiff enough to function as a [...] "third leg" [...] as had been suggested by Robert Thomas Bakker.

5000|$|As {{described}} earlier, SH-AWD {{can vary}} torque {{side to side}} through the rear wheels.

The Acura RL is designed with a third planetary gear set and clutch pack that are packaged into a so-called [...] "Acceleration Device", which is bolted in front of the rear differential unit. [...] The Acceleration Device allows torque to be passed <b>to</b> the <b>rear</b> wheels at a near one to one ratio, but in cornering situations, the Acceleration Device variably increases the torque passed <b>to</b> the <b>rear</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5%, depending on the cornering situation.|$|R

50|$|Since {{early in}} the history of their study, scientists, such as Osborn, have speculated that sauropods could <b>rear</b> <b>up</b> on their hind legs, using the tail as the third leg of a tripod. A {{skeletal}} mount depicting the diplodocid Barosaurus lentus <b>rearing</b> <b>up</b> on its hind legs at the American Museum of Natural History is one illustration of this hypothesis. In a 2005 paper, Rothschild and Molnar reasoned that if sauropods had adopted a bipedal posture at times, there would be evidence of stress fractures in the forelimb hands. However, none were found after they examined a large number of sauropod skeletons.Heinrich Mallison (in 2009) was the first to study the physical potential for various sauropods <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> into a tripodal stance. Mallison found that some characters previously linked <b>to</b> <b>rearing</b> adaptations were actually unrelated (such as the wide-set hip bones of titanosaurs) or would have hindered rearing. For example, titanosaurs had an unusually flexible backbone, which would have decreased stability in a tripodal posture and would have put more strain on the muscles. Likewise, it is unlikely that brachiosaurids could <b>rear</b> <b>up</b> onto the hind legs, as their center of gravity was much farther forward than other sauropods, which would cause such a stance to be unstable.|$|R
