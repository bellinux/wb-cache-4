50|$|Hazra, {{considered}} by many as a pioneer of nuclear medicine in India, {{is best known for}} his contributions to radioimmunoassays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. He is credited with pioneering contributions in the monitoring of hypothyroidism and in the analysis of triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH hormones. He is reported to have developed T3 and TSH hormmone tests and the technique to contain cancerous cells using isotopes, deploying a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protocol</b> called radio-bioconjugate therapy. Reports confirm that these achievements assisted him to be shortlisted for the Nobel Prize for Physiology in 1977.|$|E

40|$|Main guide-lines {{of medical}} therapy of benign thyroid {{diseases}} are reviewed. The most common drug therapy {{of the various}} forms of hyperthyroidism is represented by thionamide drugs (methimazole and propylthiouracil). <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>protocols</b> are diversified according to the disease. In Graves'disease medical therapy may present the definitive treatment, leading to remission in little less than 50 % of cases while in hyperfunctioning nodular thyroid diseases, medical therapy is merely in preparation for ablation therapy. Other drugs used in hyperthyroidism are also mentioned (inorganic iodine, potassium perchlorate, beta-blockers). Thyroxine replacement therapy in {{the various forms of}} hypothyroidism is then analyzed, discussing in particular the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protocols</b> and follow-up of the various forms of hypothyroidism.

ABA, which applies principles from the science of behavior to understand human behavior, has been implemented across various settings including hospitals, schools, and homes {{in a variety of}} behavior and learning problems. It is also an effective tool for improving the lives of people with autism spectrum disorders. According to Mental Health: A report of the Surgeon General, [...] "thirty years of research demonstrated the efficacy of applied behavioral methods in reducing inappropriate behavior and in increasing communication, learning, and appropriate social behavior [...] " [...] in autistic children.

His researches assisted in identifying cholesterol as a modulator in leishmaniasis infection and his team has developed a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protocol</b> for treating leishmaniasis by administering microRNA molecules in patients which has been found to raise the cholesterol level which in turn reduced the parasite levels. The treatment, combined with other drugs have been reported to be effective in treating the disease commonly known as Kala azar, which has a reported high drug resistance. One of his earlier projects, Mechanism of mRNA compartmentalization in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, was funded by the Wellcome Trust. On his current project, miRNA expoprt and Stability, he has worked on the mammalian immune and cancer cells and reportedly discovered miRNA activity modulation mechanisms in those cells.|$|E

He is also credited with the isolation of Hepatitis E virus and the introduction of a new <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protocol</b> of the Hepatitis E as well as Hepatitis C using herbal plants. His researches have been documented in over 225 medical papers and four monographs.

5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of the signing of the protocol, Garcia characterized general prison facilities as [...] "living hells", because those who are in penology and rehabilitation [...] "are missing out the essence of compassion, redemption and restoration in jail management". He added: [...] "They are too busy looking for creative ways to punish an offender instead of restoring him to become the human being that he is. We have to look at prisons beyond the cycle of crime and punishment and certainly look inside underlying social, cultural and scriptural implications of rehabilitation. As it is, those creative ways of punishing offenders that have led to restrictive and punitive conditions in jails have also bred demons out of prisoners". Garcia said that this <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protocol</b> of dance and music is meant to restore dignity to people who suffer the stigma of incarceration and restore self-esteem to inmates because they are alienated from society. Therapeutic music and dance is meant to help prisoners cope with their depression and anxiety, improve their well-being as they go through a transition phase and reintegrate to society. Music is a protocol to heal them of emotional and psychological disorders and trauma {{as a result of the}} offense or incarceration". He concluded that [...] "the experience of the CPDRC Dancing Inmates has proven a clinical breakthrough of using therapeutic music and dance in healing, restoring and rehabilitating inmates to become dignified human beings. This is actually what prompted BMJP to take interest in spreading such a program", he said.|$|E
40|$|SummaryA {{decision}} to start radiotherapy {{should be based}} on at least two documents: 1. Written standards of obligatory clinical procedures which are in fact radiotherapeutic schemes. 2. Therapeutic protocols describing all mandatory procedures performed to ensure a safe and proper treatment of the patient. The range of activities described in the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protocol</b> is very wide. It includes all initial procedures implemented in the simulation room, the CT scanner, in the treatment planning system and the mould- room, and it describes the verification process of the treatment plan, mandatory to start radiotherapy. The <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protocol</b> describes in details what and how should be checked by an internal control system and it qualifies the demands required to sum up the treatment and its’ accordance with the planned radiotherapy scheme.
