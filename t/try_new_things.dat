5|$|Final Fantasy Xs {{development}} {{began in}} 1999, costing approximately ¥4 billion (approximately US$32.3 million) {{with a crew}} of over 100 people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series. Executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that although he had concerns about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, {{the success of the}} Final Fantasy series can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to <b>try</b> <b>new</b> <b>things.</b> Producer Yoshinori Kitase was also the chief director of Final Fantasy X, while the direction of events, maps and battles was split up between Motomu Toriyama, Takayoshi Nakazato and Toshiro Tsuchida, respectively. The development of the script for the game took three to four months, with {{the same amount of time}} dedicated to the voice recording afterwards. Kazushige Nojima collaborated with Daisuke Watanabe, Toriyama and Kitase on writing the scenario for Final Fantasy X. Nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that the player's progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own understanding and narration.|$|E
5|$|Marge and Homer argue {{later that}} night. Homer tells Marge {{that even though}} getting the {{trampoline}} was a mistake at least {{he is willing to}} <b>try</b> <b>new</b> <b>things,</b> while she is boring and nags too much. Marge disagrees, but discovers that Bart and Lisa agree with Homer's assessment. She becomes annoyed and stays the night at Patty and Selma's house. While there, she is introduced to an infomercial featuring self-help guru Brad Goodman, who supposedly can help her with her chronic nagging. After Marge and Homer watch a Brad Goodman video, Marge is more tolerant {{and the two of them}} get along better. Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts the lecture, and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E

500|$|Rae {{recorded}} most of The Sea in 2009 at Manchester's Limefield Studios. She co-produced {{the record}} mostly with Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou, {{both of whom}} had worked on her debut album. Rae pursued a sound more aggressive than on her debut. During the recording process, Rae listened to the 1973 Sly & the Family Stone record Fresh and Curtis Mayfield's There's No Place Like America Today (1975), {{as well as the}} music of Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen. A live band was used in the album's recording, which was also a departure from her debut. [...] "On the first album, it was me and a producer in a basement going though hundreds of snare drum sounds to find the right one", she recalled. [...] "With a live band, you can stretch out more and <b>try</b> <b>new</b> <b>things</b> out without feeling you're having to undo this meticulously built-up track".|$|E

500|$|By {{making the}} biopic, Dodd Darin and Spacey {{acknowledged}} the similar career experiences between Darin and Spacey. [...] "A {{lot of people}} doubted my dad's abilities, and Kevin's had doubters and naysayers," [...] Dodd commented. [...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. My dad would always <b>try</b> <b>new</b> <b>things.</b> You could never pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness about getting the film made right up there with Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E
500|$|While similar body-swapping games already existed, such as Paradroid (1985), {{they had}} little {{influence}} {{on the development of}} Space Station Silicon Valley. The team were instead influenced by other games in development at DMA, including Grand Theft Auto and Body Harvest (1998). Unlike those games, Space Station Silicon Valley does not take place in an open world; [...] "they're a bugger to make," [...] explained creative director Gary Penn. The objective of the team was to create a game where players were encouraged to <b>try</b> <b>new</b> <b>things</b> to see the outcome. The original concept for the game was that players would eat robots and become increasingly larger, retrospectively described by creative director lead artist Jamie Bryan as being similar to [...] (2002). Another early idea was for the in-game animals to consist of different parts, and destroying one animal would allow players to swap some features with their existing body; this was quickly discarded, as the team realised it would require extensive testing.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Blair {{expressed}} {{frustration that}} Carmella {{had become a}} [...] "very tortured, depressive character {{and there was no}} {{light at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to <b>try</b> <b>new</b> <b>things</b> and go to a place where people have no idea what I have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E
