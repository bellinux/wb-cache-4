5|$|The patrons {{ensured that}} cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally {{applicable}} <b>to</b> <b>horse</b> racing and prizefighting, {{was based on}} the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.|$|E
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as <b>to</b> <b>horse</b> merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E
5|$|Mup {{genes from}} other mammals also encode {{allergenic}} proteins, for example Feld4 is primarily {{produced in the}} submandibular salivary gland and is deposited onto dander as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against the protein. Most had higher titres of antibodies against Feld4 than against Feld1, another prominent cat allergen. Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed <b>to</b> <b>horse</b> allergens.|$|E

40|$|Prima facie, meaning {{seems to}} be a {{normative}} property in the simple following sense: if something exemplifies a given meaning property, then some normative consequences follow. So, for example, if the French word „cheval ‟ means HORSE — if it is correctly used <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>horses</b> —, then {{it is a mistake to}} use it to refer to things that are not horses. Equivalently, one ought to use it <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>horses</b> and only <b>to</b> <b>horses</b> (provided some idealizations). Similarly, my concept HORSE — the thought constituent expressible by the French word „cheval ‟ — correctly applies <b>to</b> <b>horses</b> and only <b>to</b> <b>horses.</b> So my concept ought to be tokened <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>horses</b> and only <b>to</b> <b>horses.</b> Or else, I misapply it. The fact that it would be a mistake to use the word „cheval ‟ to refer to non-horses signals the fact that meaning is a normative property or that it has normative implications. So does the fact that one ought to use a word in certain circumstances and not in others. And furthermore this norm arises in virtue of the meaning of the word. The question I want to ask is: Is meaning intrinsically normative? As I understand it, to claim [N] that meaning is intrinsically normative is to claim both [N 1...|$|R
5|$|The main {{striking}} {{force of the}} Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted <b>to</b> <b>horse</b> archers. Due {{to the cost of}} their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.|$|E
5|$|Under Wilkes' ownership, the Spirit, which {{previously}} had covered mainly sporting events, expanded its coverage to include political matters. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Wilkes covered the battles also. He {{was present at}} the First Battle of Bull Run and wrote an account of it. He continued to serve as a correspondent throughout the war and contracted the kidney disease which he later died from during his war journalism. Wilkes also used literary feuds with other newspapers, {{both in and out of}} the sporting press, to help his subscription rates. After the Civil War, Wilkes' Spirit was one of the three leading newspapers in New York City. Two, including the Spirit, of the three were mainly devoted <b>to</b> <b>horse</b> racing– the other being The Turf, Field and Farm by Sanders D. Bruce.|$|E

25|$|In the post-independence period, many {{efforts were}} made to {{regulate}} and support the horse racing industry in Ireland, and a greater effort was made to promote Irish horses internationally. As early as 1926, the Irish Free State legislated to allow off-course betting, and the Tote was introduced in 1930 to raise funds for the industry. The Emergency that accompanied the Second World War was reportedly beneficial <b>to</b> <b>horse</b> racing, as restrictions on foreign and motor travel led to an increase in spectator numbers. The Irish Racing Board, the predecessor <b>to</b> <b>Horse</b> Racing Ireland, was set up in 1945 to oversee the economics of the industry, followed by the Irish Horse Authority in 1995 and Horse Racing Ireland in 2001.|$|E
