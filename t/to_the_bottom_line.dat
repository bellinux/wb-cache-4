500|$|Increasingly, American-made genre {{films were}} joined by foreign movies {{acquired}} at low cost and, where necessary, dubbed for the U.S. market. In 1956, distributor Joseph E. Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film Godzilla. The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958), major influences on future horror film style. In 1959, Levine's Embassy Pictures bought the worldwide rights to Hercules, a cheaply made Italian movie starring American-born bodybuilder Steve Reeves. On top of a $125,000 purchase price, Levine then spent [...] on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount. The New York Times was nonplussed, claiming that the movie would have drawn [...] "little more than yawns in the film market... {{had it not been}} [...] throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity." [...] Levine counted on first-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film [...] "into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him." [...] Hercules opened at a remarkable 600 theaters, and the strategy was a smashing success: the film earned [...] in domestic rentals. Just as valuable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line,</b> it was even more successful overseas. Within a few decades, Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very much like Levine's.|$|E
2500|$|Promoter Joseph E. Levine was {{the crucial}} U.S. figure in {{exploiting}} the opportunities offered by foreign genre production. In 1956, low-budget producer Richard Kay acquired a Japanese creature feature, Godzilla, for $30,000. Levine financed {{the shooting of}} new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the film—the total cost to the U.S. partnership was less than $100,000. The Americanized version, Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, was distributed on the East Coast by Levine's Embassy Pictures. Levine himself {{came up with a}} string of taglines: [...] "Fantastic beyond comprehension, beyond compare—Astounding beyond belief!", [...] "Terror staggers the mind as the gargantuan creature of the sea surges up on a tidal wave of destruction to wreak vengeance on the Earth!", and many more. Godzilla, King of the Monsters! was a B-market hit, grossing over $2million in its original run. In 1959, Embassy acquired the worldwide rights to a cheaply made movie starring an American-born bodybuilder as one of the original superheroes. Steve Reeves had appeared in all of two films previously; his debut was in the independent production Jail Bait (1954), directed by Ed Wood On top of a $125,000 purchase price for his import, Levine then spent $1.5million on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount. The New York Times was nonplussed: [...] "Hercules, an Italianmade spectacle film dubbed in English, is the kind of picture that normally would draw little more than yawns in the film market. It would have, that is, had it not been that promoter Joseph E. Levine has launched the movie throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity. The exploitation film, which has been taken over by Warner Brothers for distribution, opened yesterday at 135 theatres in the New York area alone." [...] Levine counted on opening-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film [...] "into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him."

5000|$|The glyph used in {{the modern}} Western world to {{represent}} the number 2 traces its roots back to the Brahmin Indians, who wrote [...] "2" [...] as two horizontal lines. The modern Chinese and Japanese languages still use this method. The Gupta rotated the two lines 45 degrees, making them diagonal, and sometimes also made the top line shorter and made its bottom end curve towards {{the center of the}} bottom line. Apparently for speed, the Nagari started making the top line more like a curve and connecting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line.</b> The Ghubar Arabs made the bottom line completely vertical, and now the glyph looks like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> leads to our modern glyph.|$|E

40|$|Corporations {{sometimes}} tread a {{fine line}} by disclosing <b>the</b> data necessary <b>to</b> calculate <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> impact of {{a particular set of}} facts, while failing <b>to</b> disclose <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> itself. For example, in 2002, Merck 2 ̆ 6 Co., Inc., disclosed that one of its subsidiaries had recognized as revenue co-payments it never actually received, but failed <b>to</b> disclose that <b>the</b> total amount so recognized was 5. 54 billion for the year 2001. When plaintiffs challenge such incomplete disclosure, courts routinely dismiss their claims based upon what I call the Simple Math rule. The Simple Math rule states that, assuming a material <b>bottom</b> <b>line,</b> disclosing <b>the</b> data necessary <b>to</b> calculate <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> suffices <b>to</b> make failure <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> math for investors an immaterial omission as a matter of law. This is, in fact, what the Third Circuit concluded in the Merck case. I argue, however, that courts should apply what I call the Reasonably Available Data rule, which builds upon existing materiality doctrines to analyze each particular omission on its own facts. Specifically, I argue that when courts are presented with the question of whether failure <b>to</b> explicitly disclose <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> constitutes a material omission, they should ask: (1) whether all the relevant pieces of data necessary <b>to</b> calculate <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> were disclosed proximately to one another and the place where a reasonable investor would expect to find them; (2) whether the data was cross-referenced to; and (3) whether the import of the data was sufficiently highlighted <b>to</b> alert <b>the</b> reasonable investor. In addition, where <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> was omitted in a corrective disclosure, that fact should weigh in favor of finding materiality. Finally, a presumption of materiality should be applied where <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> is subsequently made public and the market reacts negatively to that disclosure. This proposed approach is consistent with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s admonition against the use of bright-line rules in the context of materiality determinations. Furthermore, it makes sense from a policy standpoint because it continues <b>to</b> serve <b>the</b> safety-valve function of the Simple Math rule by allowing courts to dismiss frivolous claims, while avoiding the erosion of a materiality standard that is so integral to our modern disclosure regime...|$|R
