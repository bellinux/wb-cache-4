The punter held onto the ball and attempted to run, but Brown tackled him for a 12-yard loss. Later, Leake punted and Hanulak returned and threatened to score. Leake, the last man between Hanulak and the endzone, made <b>the</b> <b>tackle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|He {{played on}} the {{freshman}} squad in 1910 and on the varsity squad from 1911 to 1913, first as an end, then a tackle in 1912, and finally as a fullback in 1913. Of the three, Shaughnessy said he preferred <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> position. In 1912, he recovered three fumbles against Iowa, and Walter Camp named him an alternate on his All-America team. As a senior, Shaughnessy {{was named to the}} All-Big Ten Conference first team.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} play after the interception, Pegues gained one yard on a rushing play to the right. Clark then {{completed}} a pass to Jarrett Ferguson at the Alabama 36-yard line for a first down. During the play, Alabama was called for a five-yard penalty for grabbing Ferguson's facemask during <b>the</b> <b>tackle.</b> After the penalty, Angelo Harrison gained nine yards on a reverse run. Ferguson then was tackled for a loss of two yards, and Clark threw an incomplete pass on third down. Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in Graham to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick sailed right of the goal, however. With 4:10 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led Alabama 70.|$|E
5|$|The Baptists had {{sustained}} {{injuries in}} its opening {{game against the}} Georgia Bulldogs, and their practice schedule was hampered by rain. Near {{the end of the}} first quarter, Godchaux finally got off a good punt to Mercer's 10-yard line and Tom Ryan made <b>the</b> <b>tackle.</b> Godchaux returned Mercer's punt ten yards, beginning a drive gaining six yards off-tackle. On the next play Doc Kuhn passed to Tot McCullough for twelve yards and first down on the nine-yard line. Rupert Smith ran to the five-yard line, and then to the two. Red Williams fumbled on the next play, but it was recovered by Alf Sharpe in the end zone.|$|E

5|$|Barton's {{subsequent}} conviction, {{a four-month}} suspended sentence for the earlier assault on Ousmane Dabo at Manchester City, was handed out while serving this sentence. He returned to playing action on 30 August 2008, six {{days before his}} FA hearing, as a second-half substitute during Newcastle's 3–0 defeat to Arsenal. He came on to a chorus of boos from the Arsenal supporters. Shortly into this return match, Barton was involved in an incident with Samir Nasri, putting in a strong tackle, for which the referee did not give a foul. <b>The</b> <b>tackle,</b> though hard, was legal. Minutes later, Nasri deliberately clipped Barton while tracking back, {{for which he was}} booked. At the end of the match, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan was involved in an altercation with Nasri and Arsenal captain William Gallas, in regards to the incident.|$|E
5|$|Five former Rams players also {{jumped to}} the Browns in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams and backs Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move {{gave rise to a}} legal battle with the Rams, who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with the Browns. Reeves, the Rams' owner, filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with the Browns, claiming <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> unlawfully broke his contract to play for the Rams. Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. At the end of August 1946, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore was not bound to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
5|$|He {{also scored}} the final try {{of the match}} in Wigan's fifth round cup win over Wakefield Trinity, and {{although}} he was found guilty {{on a charge of}} kicking out in <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> against another player, he escaped a match ban. With Smith expressing his desire to return home to Australia following the 2009 season, Tomkins was tipped by Lenagan as Wigan's long-term replacement at stand-off. Tomkins was named in a train-on squad for England's friendly test match against France, although he did not play. He was dropped in round 15 for Wigan's match against Salford, but returned off the bench and scored against Hull Kingston Rovers in round 18. Tomkins played every game for Wigan thereafter, except for the final regular round fixture of the season against Huddersfield, until the team were knocked out of the Super League play-offs by St. Helens. Included in this run of appearances was a hat-trick and Tomkins' first drop goal against Castleford in round 25.|$|E

5000|$|In rugby league {{the ball}} is {{returned}} to play following a <b>tackle</b> via <b>the</b> [...] "play the ball", in which <b>the</b> <b>tackled</b> player gets back {{to his feet and}} rolls the ball back to a teammate, usually <b>the</b> hooker. <b>The</b> <b>tackled</b> player will usually try to return to the ball to play as quickly as possible before the defensive line can re-form.|$|R

5|$|He {{was handed}} a two-match {{suspension}} after receiving his 10th yellow card {{of the season}} during a 1–0 home victory over Newport County in an FA Trophy second round replay on 26 January 2010. He returned in a 1–0 away win over Kettering on 6 February 2010, before being handed a three-match suspension {{as a result of}} being sent off during a 1–0 away defeat to Ebbsfleet a week later after his elbow caught Dean Pooley. This resulted in a head wound that required three stitches for Pooley, and York's directors and manager apologised to Ebbsfleet manager Liam Daish for <b>the</b> <b>tackle.</b> Following Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference in March 2010, the three goals Brodie scored against them were discounted as their results were expunged. He scored {{for the first time in}} 12 matches with two goals in a 4–0 victory away to Grays on 30 March 2010. He scored two goals against Barrow on 13 April 2010 in a 3–0 home victory, a result that confirmed York's place in the play-offs.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began with}} a Maryland kickoff to California, who were stopped for {{a net loss of}} 4yards and forced to punt. On Maryland's first possession, it mounted a 60-yard drive that culminated in a 24-yard {{touchdown}} rush by Da'Rel Scott. California quarterback Kevin Riley then threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, which allowed Scott to rush for his second score of the game. California made a field goal, but on the following series, Maryland drove 60yards and tight end Dan Gronkowski made a touchdown reception. The Golden Bears made another field goal to end the first half with a score of 21–6, in Maryland's favor. During the second quarter, Riley threw a short screen pass to running back Jahvid Best, who immediately received a hard hit from Maryland cornerback Kevin Barnes. While still lying on the field, Best rolled to his side to vomit. Footage of <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> and its aftermath circulated widely on the internet and became a viral video phenomenon. In the third period, Chris Turner completed a pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey for a 27-yard touchdown to end the quarter with Maryland in the lead, 28–6. In the final period, California scored two touchdowns against a preventative defense, before Maryland responded with a fifth score on a one-yard rush by Davin Meggett. In the final minutes, Maryland placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 27-yard field goal which would have clinched the victory. Instead, California scored a third touchdown to close within eight points. With 1:55 remaining to play, California attempted an onside kick, but it bounced out of bounds, and Maryland was able to run out the clock to win the upset, 35–28.|$|E
25|$|The most skilful {{forwards}} will, {{during a}} hit-up, look {{to release the}} ball to a supporting player before <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> is completed; known as an off-load. The hit-up, if successful, should create spaces in the defensive line due to defending players having been drawn into <b>the</b> <b>tackle.</b> This creates opportunities for the supporting players to breach the defensive line while the defence is busy trying to contain the initial hit-up.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the diagram}} shown here, {{the number of}} rope {{sections}} of <b>the</b> <b>tackles</b> shown is as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> left <b>tackle</b> (LT) {{is usually}} the team's best pass blocker. Of <b>the</b> two <b>tackles,</b> <b>the</b> left <b>tackles</b> will often have better {{footwork}} and agility than <b>the</b> right <b>tackle</b> in order to counteract the pass rush of defensive ends. When a quarterback throws a forward pass, the quarterback's shoulders are aligned roughly perpendicular {{to the line of}} scrimmage, with the non-dominant shoulder closer to downfield. Right-handed quarterbacks, the majority of players in the position, thus turn their backs to defenders coming from the left side, creating a vulnerable [...] "blind side" [...] that <b>the</b> left <b>tackle</b> must protect. (Conversely, teams with left-handed quarterbacks tend to have their better pass blockers at right <b>tackle</b> for <b>the</b> same reason.) ...|$|R
25|$|During the play-the-ball it is {{customary}} for {{a player}} from the defending team to stand {{directly in front of}} the player playing the ball, called the marker. If no marker is present, <b>the</b> <b>tackled</b> player may tap the ball on his boot to start the next play, instead of the normally required play-the-ball. As the tap is faster to perform than the play-the-ball, giving great advantage to the attack, there is almost always a marker. Usually <b>the</b> person who <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> player becomes a marker because he is the closest to <b>the</b> <b>tackled</b> player. There may be a maximum of two markers for each play-the-ball, the second standing behind the first.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tackle</b> is {{complete}} when the ball-carrier {{is brought to}} the ground; this is judged {{to be the case}} as soon as a knee touches the ground while being held by the opposition. The tackler is designated as any player that also goes to ground when making <b>the</b> <b>tackle.</b> If no player goes to ground when tackling a player, then there is no tackler. The tackler has to immediately let the tackled player go and get to their feet before attempting to compete for the ball. If they do not get to their feet, they must roll away from the tackled player. The player that is tackled must immediately play the ball by pushing, passing or placing it in any direction. If a player is involved in <b>the</b> <b>tackle,</b> but does not go to ground, they must also release the tackled player, allowing them the chance to play the ball. Only players on their feet, and supporting their own weight, may pick up the ball and any players on the ground must not prevent them from gaining possession. Except for the tackler (player who went to ground when making <b>the</b> <b>tackle)</b> and the tackled player, all other players must enter <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> area from behind the ball. <b>The</b> <b>tackle</b> must not be dangerous. Dangerous tackles are ones that make contact with their opponent around their neck or head, with a locked elbow and extended arm ("stiff arm"), without using their arms ("shoulder charge"), when they are in the air, when they don't have the ball, or ones that drive or drop a players head or neck into the ground while their feet are in the air ("spear tackle"). Using a foot to trip a player is also illegal.|$|E
25|$|The {{one-on-one}} strip {{is performed}} by a defender on an attacking player when that defender {{is the only person}} involved in <b>the</b> <b>tackle.</b> A player is ruled to be in <b>the</b> <b>tackle</b> if he/she is currently holding onto or has only just recently let go of the attacking player. The strip itself is the act of taking the ball from the arms of an attacking player, thus gaining possession for the defending team (who becomes the attacking team).|$|E
