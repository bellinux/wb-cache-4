50|$|In 1990, the {{unnumbered}} road {{south of}} Sylvania was designated as SR 829. In 1993, a western bypass of Springfield, designated as SR 863, was proposed from SR 21 south-southeast {{of the city}} to another intersection with SR 21 northwest <b>of</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 21 in the Sylvania area was shifted south-southwest, replacing <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 829 and then routed on US 301/SR 73 Loop. Its former path was redesignated as SR 21 Bus. In 1995, <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 21 in the Millen area was shifted northward, replacing <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 828. <b>The</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> US 17 in Savannah, north of I-16, was shifted eastward, off of I-516/US 80/SR 21/SR 25/SR 26 and onto I-16 and SR 404 Spur.

The Silent Blade (1998) describes the group's journey to permanently destroy the Crystal Shard. Sea of Swords (2001) continues Drizzt's story after the events of The Spine of the World (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and Servant of the Shard (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle as the main characters. Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{believed}} that Burnt Norton could benefit society. The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} Original Sin, that they can follow <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> either good or evil, {{and that they can}} atone for their sins. To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world and look into their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E
5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> swamps and channels.|$|E

5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that further archaeological digs could yield substantial rewards, considering that {{the remains of the}} original city are still preserved under hundreds of years of rubbish. Some archaeological excavations have taken place, <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> streets are still visible, and some buildings have been partially reconstructed to waist-height. But the site is difficult and dangerous to access because of the nearby slums. However, some artifacts that have been recovered so far can be seen in Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art.|$|E

5|$|No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western thriller film produced, directed, written, {{and edited}} by Joel and Ethan Coen. Based on Cormac McCarthy's {{novel of the}} same name, the film is about an {{ordinary}} man to whom chance delivers a fortune that is not his, and the ensuing cat-and-mouse drama as <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> three men intertwine in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. The film stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and Javier Bardem, with Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, and Beth Grant in featured roles.|$|E
5|$|On May 15, 2014, {{the journal}} Nature {{published}} a peer-reviewed submission from October 2013 by James P. Kossin, Kerry A. Emanuel, and Gabriel A. Vecchi {{that suggests that}} a poleward migration exists for <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> maximum intensity of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The focus of the report is on the latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are reaching maximum intensity. Their data indicates that during the past thirty years, the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres {{at a rate of}} approximately 60km per decade, amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk <b>the</b> <b>Paths</b> <b>of</b> the Dead in an effort to {{convince}} the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, <b>the</b> <b>Paths</b> <b>of</b> the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As it seems they are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, two {{tourist attractions}} {{were added to}} the middle of Central Basin. The Captain James Cook Memorial was built by the {{government}} to commemorate the Bicentenary of (then Lieutenant) James Cook's first sighting of the east coast of Australia. It includes a water jet fountain located in the central basin (based on the Jet d'eau in Geneva) and a skeleton globe sculpture at Regatta Point showing <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> Cook's expeditions. On 25 April 1970, Queen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the memorial. As part of the same ceremony, Queen Elizabeth also opened the National Carillon on Aspen Island, a set of 53 bronze bells donated by the British Government to commemorate the city's 50th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of the}} Przeworsk culture's {{internal}} {{crisis situation}} came external pressures, namely the massive migration of peoples. At around 370 AD the Huns crossed the Volga River, defeating the Alans and then the Ostrogoths, causing in 375 the fall of their state located in the Black Sea shores region. This unleashed a domino effect, as various Germanic peoples moved west and south to avoid the danger. The Visigoths and others retreated, forcing further migrations, while {{the weakness of the}} Roman Empire encouraged encroachments of its territory, the whole scenario resulting in the fall of its western part. <b>The</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> this Great Migration of Peoples led in part through the Polish lands, and the Germanic tribes living here joined the movement themselves, with the result of an almost complete, {{in the course of the}} 5th century, depopulation of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Several {{flights in}} and out of the state were delayed or {{canceled}}, and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry canceled travel across the Delaware Bay during the duration of Isabel. In Atlantic City, casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances. New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses, railways, and light rail equipment. To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane, NJ Transit prepared backup generators, pumps, and chainsaws, with workers inspecting trains and <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> the lines. FEMA mobilized and dispatched an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force of 28people to the state for possible rescue duty. Days before the storm made landfall, the Salvation Army prepared food and aid for potentially affected citizens. In anticipation for the effects of Isabel, Governor Jim McGreevey declared a state of emergency, which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deal with the situation.|$|E
5|$|The Lord of the Rings {{contains}} {{several more}} supporting scenes, {{and has a}} more sophisticated plot structure, following <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The {{differences between the two}} stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not. Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children, and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of Middle-earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.|$|E
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. <b>The</b> <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E
