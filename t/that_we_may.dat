5|$|We {{thought it}} fit to commend these things most fully to your care {{that you may}} {{know that we have}} given to those Christians free and {{unrestricted}} opportunity of religious worship. When you see that this has been granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship {{for the sake of the}} peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion.|$|E
5|$|We wretched and needy men reverently give thee thanks, almighty God, heavenly Father, for {{the food}} which thou hast sanctified and {{bestowed}} for the sustenance of the body, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> use it thankfully; {{at the same time}} we beseech thee that thou wouldst impart to us the food of angels, the true bread of heaven, the eternal word of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, so that our mind may feed on him and that through his flesh and blood we may be nourished, sustained and strengthened.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle {{also had}} some {{scientific}} blind spots.

25|$|One {{concern is}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> {{end up with}} {{thousands}} of vaccines to prevent every virus that can change our cells. Viruses can have different effects on {{different parts of the}} body. It may be possible to prevent a number of different cancers by immunizing against one viral agent. It is likely that HPV, for instance, has a role in cancers of the mucous membranes of the mouth.|$|E

25|$|We {{claim that}} the {{defendant}} is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue {{as to whether he}} taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E
25|$|It (Independence) {{belongs to}} all of us and that is why we {{celebrate}} it. Do you think, however, that our nation from the outset needs only men to serve it? Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years of}} our nation and Islam. From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different {{from what it was}} in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; it means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E
25|$|For {{a simple}} example, take the {{presentation}} {a | a3}. Writing A for the inverse of a, we have possible strings combining {{any number of}} the symbols a and A. Whenever we see aaa, or aA or Aa we may strike these out. We should also remember to strike out AAA; this says that since the cube of a is the identity element of G, so is the cube of the inverse of a. Under these conditions the word problem becomes easy. First reduce strings to the empty string, a, aa, A or AA. Then note <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> also multiply by aaa, so we can convert A to aa and convert AA to a. The {{result is that the}} word problem, here for the cyclic group of order three, is solvable.|$|E
