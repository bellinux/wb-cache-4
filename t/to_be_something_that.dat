5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E

25|$|With {{the failure}} to {{establish}} a political consensus after the January 1910 general election, the Liberals called a second general election in December. The Conservative leadership decided that a good test of {{the popularity of the}} tariff reform programme would be to have a prominent tariff reformer stand for election in a disputed seat. They considered Law a prime candidate, and after debating it for a month he guardedly agreed, enthusiastic about the idea but worried about the effect of a defeat on the Party. Law was selected as the candidate for Manchester North West, and became drawn into party debates about how strong a tariff reform policy should be put in their manifesto. Law personally felt that duties on foodstuffs should be excluded, something agreed to by Alexander Acland-Hood, Edward Carson and others {{at a meeting of the}} Constitutional Club on 8 November 1910, but they failed to reach a consensus and the idea of including or excluding food duties continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> divided the party.|$|E

The song was performed by the Bonzos in the Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour. The song's name was in turn taken from an invented pulp fiction crime magazine, devised by the English academic Richard Hoggart in his 1957 study of working class culture, The Uses of Literacy. In a 2011 interview, Gibbard stated, [...] "The name was never supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{someone was going to}} reference 15 years on.

[...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious and a little more important." ...|$|E

[...] In June he discussed the symphony with his future son-in-law Jussi Jalas and provided another reason for its non-completion: [...] "For each of my symphonies I have developed a special technique. It can't be something superficial, it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has been lived though. In my new work I am struggling with precisely these issues."

500|$|The {{release of}} Paige's first full studio album of new {{recordings}} in 12years was marked in 2006, titled Essential Musicals. The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, {{and she had}} been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. On 20 and 21 December 2006, she performed in concert in Shanghai, extending her concert tour to two dates to satisfy demand. With a noticeable absence from musical theatre, having not taken a role for many years, she explained in 2006 that [...] "there's been nothing that I've wanted to do, and if you're going to commit to a year at the theatre, six days a week, and have no life, then it's got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{you want to do with}} all your heart". [...] She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.|$|E
500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{production}} designer was Scott Chambliss, {{a longtime}} collaborator with Abrams. Chambliss {{worked with a}} large group of concept illustrators, including James Clyne, Ryan Church, creature designer Neville Page, and Star Trek veteran John Eaves. Abrams stated the difficulty of depicting the future was that much of modern technology was inspired by the original show, and made it seem outdated. Thus the production design had to be consistent with the television series but also feel more advanced than the real world technology developed after it. [...] "We all have the iPhone that does more than the communicator," [...] said Abrams. [...] "I feel like there's a certain thing that you can't really hold onto, which is kind of the kitschy quality. That must go if it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you believe is real." [...] Prop master Russell Bobbitt collaborated with Nokia on recreating the original communicator, creating a $50,000 prototype. Another prop recreated for the film was the tricorder. Bobbitt brought the original prop to the set, but the actors found it too large to carry when filming action scenes, so technical advisor Doug Brody redesigned it to be smaller. The phaser props were designed as spring-triggered barrels that revolve and glow as the setting switches from [...] "stun" [...] to [...] "kill". An Aptera Typ-1 prototype car was used on location.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} song, [...] "Love in This Club", was sung by Usher, with guest vocals from rapper Young Jeezy also present. It {{was written}} by Usher, Polow da Don, Lamar Taylor, Young Jeezy, Ryon Lovett, Keith Thomas and Darnell Dalton, with da Don producing the track. The remix features additional writing from Lil Wayne, with Soundz producing the track. Usher {{said in an interview}} with MTV of the song, [...] "I wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would be a surprise, be a shock. Have shock value. That's what the remix is all about." [...] On working with Beyoncé, he said, [...] "It's a treat for me. I've been wanting for years to do a record with Beyoncé. Even though it's a remix, it's a really special record for me". He also spoke highly of Wayne, dubbing him [...] "one of the illest in the game". The song was originally intended to be sung by Usher with Mariah Carey and rapper Plies. While Plies had recorded two verses for the song, he and Carey did not appear on the final cut, with Beyoncé and Wayne featuring instead. Rumours also surfaced that R singer Keri Hilson would make an appearance on the tune. The song, one of the last additions to Here I Stand, was recorded at Hitland Studios in Alpharetta and The Record Plant in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E
500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E
