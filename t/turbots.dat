5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny <b>turbots</b> include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E

They resemble, {{in their}} conformation {{but not in}} their color, our flounders or flat-fish, which {{some of you may}} have caught, and many of you have eaten. These fish lie on one side, at the very bottom of the water in which they live, and consequently one eye would be buried in the mud and would be of no use, if they were formed like common fish. But as their enemies and their food must come from above them, they need both their eyes placed so that they can always look upwards. In the picture at the head of this article, you will see some Soles lying together at the bottom. These are formed in the same way. They are white on one side, which is always down except when they are swimming about, and a very dark green on the other, so that they can scarcely be distinguished from the mud when they are lying at the bottom.

60|$|In {{another case}} {{which has been}} adduced as one of special difficulty, a more {{complete}} explanation is given. Soles, <b>turbots,</b> and other flatfish are, as is well known, unsymmetrical. They live and move on their sides, the under side being usually differently coloured from that which is kept uppermost. Now the eyes of these fish are curiously distorted in order that both eyes {{may be on the}} upper side, where alone they would be of any use. It was objected by Mr. Mivart that a sudden transformation of the eye {{from one side to the}} other was inconceivable, while, if the transit were gradual the first step could be of no use, since this would not remove the eye from the lower side. But, as Mr. Darwin shows by reference to the researches of Malm and others, the young of these fish are quite symmetrical, and during their growth exhibit to us the whole process of change. This begins by the fish (owing to the increasing depth of the body) being unable to maintain the vertical position, so that it falls on one side. It then twists the lower eye as much as possible towards the upper side; and, the whole bony structure of the head being at this time soft and flexible, the constant repetition of this effort causes the eye gradually to move round the head till it comes to the upper side. Now if we suppose this process, which in the young is completed in a few days or weeks, to have been spread over thousands of generations during the development of these fish, those usually surviving whose eyes retained more and more of the position into which the young fish tried to twist them, the change becomes intelligible; though it still remains one of the most extraordinary cases of degeneration, by which symmetry--which is so universal a characteristic of the higher animals--is lost, in order that the creature may be adapted to a new mode of life, whereby it is enabled the better to escape danger and continue its existence.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{antioxidant}} systems in juvenile marine fish of commercial importance in European aquaculture, namely <b>turbot</b> (Scophthalmus maximus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). The present dietary trial was specifically designed to investigate the antioxidant effects of vitamin E under moderate oxidising conditions, including high dietary levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids and the feeding of oxidised oils. The objective was to induce a stressful pro-oxidant status to enable characterisation of the biochemical responses to peroxidative stress without causing unnecessary suffering to the experimental animals or high mortalities during the trials. Both sea bream and <b>turbot</b> showed excellent growth, whereas growth was poorer in halibut. Dietary oxidised oil significantly reduced growth in <b>turbot</b> and especially in halibut, but not in sea bream. Vitamin E improved growth in sea bream fed oxidised oil but not in <b>turbot</b> or halibut. However, vitamin E supplementation appeared to improve survival in all three species. In sea bream and <b>turbot,</b> liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were generally increased by feeding peroxidised oil and reduced by vitamin E. Conversely, in halibut, the liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were not increased by feeding peroxidised oil and only superoxide dismutase was reduced by feeding vitamin E. Consistent with these data, feeding oxidised oil increased lipid peroxidation products in halibut, but generally not in sea bream or <b>turbot.</b> Furthermore, lipid peroxidation products were generally reduced by dietary vitamin E in both sea bream and <b>turbot,</b> but not in halibut. Therefore, halibut liver antioxidant defence enzymes did not respond to dietary oxidised oil or vitamin E as occurred in <b>turbot</b> and, especially sea bream. This resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxides in halibut compared to <b>turbot</b> and sea bream in fish given dietary oxidised oil. In addition, supplemental vitamin E did not reduce lipid peroxides in halibut as it did in <b>turbot</b> and sea bream. The increased peroxidation stress in halibut may account for their poorer growth and survival in comparison to <b>turbot</b> and especially sea bream. Halibut were reared at a lower temperature, although relatively high for halibut, than either <b>turbot</b> or sea bream but they were also slightly younger/smaller fish and possibly, therefore, more developmentally immature, and either or all of these factors may be important in the lack of response of the liver enzymes in halibut...|$|R

Although the mortality in the <b>turbot</b> farms is relatively low, when this virus is detected all the stock have to be destroyed. The main goals that need to be improved in order to reduce the incidence of this disease is to know what are the strategies or molecules the host use to fight the virus and, in consequence, try to potentiate this response using different ways. Certain molecules can be selected as potential antiviral treatments because of their high protective effect against VHSV. On the other hand, the use of resistance markers for selective breeding {{is one of the most}} attractive approaches. This review englobes all the investigation concerning the immune interaction between <b>turbot</b> and VHSV, which until the last years was very scarce, and the knowledge about VHSV-resistance markers in <b>turbot.</b> Nowadays, the availability of abundant transcriptomic information and the recent sequencing of the <b>turbot</b> genome open the door to a more exhaustive and profuse investigation in these areas...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{electrical}} stunning of Atlantic cod and <b>turbot</b> in seawater to develop a protocol for the process of stunning and killing. An induced general epileptiform insult (unconscious) had a duration of 40 ± 27 s (n = 14) in cod (2. 6 ± 0. 5 kg) and 34 ± 18 s (n = 19) in <b>turbot</b> (520 ± 65 g). Seven cod and 3 <b>turbot</b> displayed a physical reaction, and 11 <b>turbot</b> registered an electroencephalogram (EEG) response to pain stimuli administered 30 s post-stun. The heart rate was 32 ± 6 beats/min in cod and 25 ± 7 beats/min in <b>turbot</b> prior to stunning. Post-stunning, the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed fibrillation and reduced activity post-stun. EEG, ECG recordings, and behavioral observations indicate that when a bipolar square wave current was applied with a frequency of 133 Hz and 43 % duty cycle side to side (<b>turbot)</b> and at 170 Hz and 33 % duty cycle (cod) head to tail, both species were stunned in seawater at current densities of 3. 2 A/dm 2 and 2. 5 A/dm 2, respectively. For <b>turbot,</b> a 5 s exposure to electricity followed by chilling in ice water for 15 min is sufficient to prevent recovery. For cod, a killing method needs to be established...|$|R

40|$|Suppression {{subtractive}} hybridization {{was used}} to investigate the response of <b>turbot,</b> Psetta maxima (L.), to Vibrio harveyi, by using a cDNA library constructed from artificially infected <b>turbot</b> kidney and spleen mRNA. Forty-nine expressed sequence tags were obtained. Several immune system genes were identified, including a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ia gene and a heat shock protein 70 gene. Some signalling molecules were also present in the cDNA libraries, including src-family tyrosine kinase SCK, sgk- 1 serine-threonine protein kinase and amyloid precursor-like protein 2. The full length of MHC class Ia cDNA was cloned from <b>turbot</b> cDNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of <b>turbot</b> MHC class Ia has been submitted to GenBank with accession number EF 032639. The <b>turbot</b> MHC class Ia cDNA has an open reading frame encoding 354 amino acids, and the deduced amino acid sequence of <b>turbot</b> MHC class Ia has 68 %, 54 %, 51 %, 52 %, 57 %, 33 %, 29 % and 29 % identities to those of olive flounder, medaka, rainbow trout, Atlantic cod, tiger puffer, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed for the MHC class Ia gene, and {{it was revealed that}} the expression level of the MHC class Ia gene in V. harveyi-challenged <b>turbot</b> increased to fourfold that of the controls...|$|R
25|$|<b>Turbot</b> and brill are benthic flatfish, {{resembling}} flounder and sole, {{but found}} in deeper offshore waters on the continental shelf. They are brownish-green, with dark blotches on the <b>turbot</b> and mottling on the brill. They are fished by coastal trawlers.|$|R
