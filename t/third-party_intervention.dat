50|$|Third parties {{often become}} {{involved}} in conflict resolution, either being called in by the disputants or acting on their own because the conflict annoys them or the community they serve. Two common forms of <b>third-party</b> <b>intervention</b> are arbitration and mediation. In arbitration, the third party listens to both sides and then renders a decision, which can be either binding or advisory. Most mediation consists of third-party assistance with negotiation. When conflict is severe and the disputants have difficulty talking calmly with each other, mediators can put them into contact and help them develop a cease-fire or settlement. If the disputants cannot or will not meet each other, mediators commonly become intermediaries and shuttle between them. Sometimes a chain of two intermediaries is necessary {{because there is no}} single individual who can communicate effectively with both sides.|$|E

Specific topics of discussion include the persistence {{of war and the}} motivation and effect of <b>third-party</b> <b>intervention</b> in altering the outcome and persistence of conflict.

Conflict persists when neither party to the fighting is sufficiently differentiated to “borrow upon” future ruling rents and optimally deter its opponent. <b>Third-party</b> <b>intervention</b> aimed at breaking a persistent conflict should focus upon creating cross-party differences in factors such as the value of political dominance, effectiveness of military arms, and cost of military arming.

This research investigated the cognitive and emotional processes underlying two types of costly <b>third-party</b> <b>interventions</b> by manipulating incidental emotions and attention focus. In Study 1, we investigated the effect of incidental anger on third-party punishment decisions. Study 2 addressed the effect of incidental anger on third-party compensation decisions. In both studies, participants were induced to either an angry or neutral emotion and then had to wait or were distracted before engaging in <b>third-party</b> <b>interventions.</b> In Study 1, angry participants punished highly unequal distributions significantly more than those in the neutral emotion condition. In Study 2, angry participants compensated highly unfair distributions significantly less than those in a neutral emotion. In both studies, the effect of incidental anger was only significant in the wait, not the distraction condition. Study 3 again focused on third-party compensation decisions. Participants were induced to either a self-focused anger or an other-focused anger emotion, and attention focus (wait, distraction) was manipulated experimentally. Those in the other-focused anger condition compensated significantly more than participants in the self-focused anger condition. These results indicate that (self-focused) incidental anger led to antagonistic responses. Incidental anger was only associated with higher third-party compensation when it includes a focus on a suffering other.

This article {{is the first to}} 1) articulate the doctrinal prerequisites for effective ex post judicial policing of fiduciaries in control transactions, and 2) theoretically unify two seemingly distinct approaches to police control transactions: the ex post judicial policing in the United States and the ex ante policing by the Takeover Panel in the United Kingdom. Shareholder collective action and asymmetric information problems, and the extent of gatekeeping by fiduciaries together determine the mode of <b>third-party</b> <b>interventions,</b> such as those by judiciaries and the Takeover Panel, in control transactions. The Article’s analysis yields normative conclusions about how judiciaries in the United States, including Delaware’s, should fine-tune gatekeeping by corporate fiduciaries in control transactions. It predicts that multijurisdictional shareholder litigation that seeks anticipatory adjudication will produce negative consequences.

40|$|The authors combine an {{empirical}} model of external intervention, with a theoretical model {{of civil war}} duration. Their empirical model of intervention allows them to analyze civil war duration, using"expected"rather than"actual"external intervention as an explanatory variable in the duration model. Unlike previous studies, they find that external intervention is positively associated with the duration of civil war. They distinguish partial <b>third-party</b> <b>interventions</b> that extend the length of war, from multilateral"peace"operations, which have a mandate to restore peace without taking sides - and which typically take place at war's end, or at least when both sides have agreed to a cease-fire. In a future paper, the authors will examine whether partial <b>third-party</b> <b>interventions</b> - whatever their effect on a war's duration - {{increase the risk of}} war's recurrence. If that proves true, then even if interventions reduce the length of civil war, they may do so at the cost of further destabilizing the political system, and sowing the seeds of future rebellion.

40|$|The {{legitimacy}} of a <b>third-party</b> <b>intervention</b> into a civil conflict {{derives from the}} recent re-conceptualization of state sovereignty. However, practical implications of <b>third-party</b> <b>intervention</b> {{still need to be}} studied. This thesis focuses on moral hazardas {{one of the most significant}} practical implication of the <b>third-party</b> <b>intervention.</b> Moral hazard occurs when a rebel group perceives the intervention as an insurance and escalates the violence within the conflict in order to get international attraction and external intervention so that it ends up being successful. The aim of this thesis is to examine how the dynamics of a civil conflict between a government and region elite, who demands a higher share from the resources in dispute and start a rebellion, changes when there is a third-party who could intervene in behalf of the region elite if the government uses brutal violence in order to suppress rebellion, by using a three-player extensive game model. The unique equilibrium derived from the model suggests, along with some other implications, ability of the region elite to manipulate the government in order to change the level of violence within the conflict. By that ability, the model indicates, humanitarian intervention is open to possibility of moral hazard since the region elite can escalate the violence in order to attract intervention whenever the expected payoff from the intervention is high enough...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of <b>third-party</b> nonviolent <b>interventions</b> as a {{supportive}} mechanism in relation to local peace-building initiatives. A framework on violence, conflict, peace, nonviolence and intervention is outlined in the theoretical chapters, to {{provide a basis for}} discussing the empirical findings of the research. Through the strategy of a case study and with a mixed-method approach of participant observations and interviews, perspectives from the context of the situation in Palestine and Israel were gathered. Five key informant interviews with former participants of <b>third-party</b> nonviolent <b>interventions</b> programmes were conducted, and during ethnographic fieldwork in Palestine and Israel, four local peace-building initiatives were studied. The findings are discussed in relation to the theoretical framework and the conclusions drawn from the discussion is that while <b>third-party</b> nonviolent <b>interventions</b> can contribute to local peace-building, it is mainly through decreasing the risk of escalation of violence in certain situations, sharing information and by supporting local peace-building initiatives. In order to be effective in this area, it is crucial that the <b>third-party</b> nonviolent <b>interventions</b> are perceptive of the local context, and reflect on the role that they play. ...|$|R

We sample the literature on interventions and offer directions for further research.

40|$|SummaryAn important, {{and perhaps}} uniquely human, {{mechanism}} for maintaining cooperation against free riders is third-party punishment [1, 2]. Our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, will not punish third parties {{even though they}} will do so when personally affected [3]. Until recently, {{little attention has been}} paid to how punishment and a sense of justice develop in children. Children respond to norm violations [4]. They are more likely to share with a puppet that helped another individual as opposed to one who behaved harmfully, and they show a preference for seeing a harmful doll rather than a victim punished [5]. By 6  years of age, children will pay a cost to punish fictional and real peers [6 – 8], and the threat of punishment will lead preschoolers to behave more generously [9]. However, little is known about what motivates a sense of justice in children. We gave 3 - and 5 -year-old children—the youngest ages yet tested—the opportunity to remove items and prevent a puppet from gaining a reward for second- and third-party violations (experiment 1), and we gave 3 -year-olds the opportunity to restore items (experiment 2). Children were as likely to engage in <b>third-party</b> <b>interventions</b> as they were when personally affected, yet they did not discriminate among the different sources of harm for the victim. When given a range of options, 3 -year-olds chose restoration over removal.

30|$|Disputes have {{traditionally}} been an important research area in sociology, and also very important in research on law and society. While the concept of dispute is introduced, the process that accompanies a dispute is a more dynamic research pathway, in that it “transfers the focus from a dispute itself (and the techniques to handle a dispute) to a social process embedded in social relationships (Nader and Todd 1978, 2007).” From the perspective of process, the occurrence and development of disputes does not only happen at once but also involves a process of transformation and escalation. For instance, the classic theory of “the three stages of disputes” in the anthropology of law claims that a dispute follows stages including grievance, conflict, and dispute (<b>third-party</b> <b>intervention)</b> (Nader and Todd 2007). Some scholars point out that dispute formation refers to the naming of disputes in terms of facts and attributes, the blaming of others, and the claiming of rights from self-identified offenders (Felstiner et al. 1980 – 1981; Cheng and Wu 2010).

40|$|What effect do {{third parties}} {{have on the}} {{evolution}} of civil wars? The authors argue that interven-tion by third parties is central to the civil war process, a process that is characterized by the dur-ation of hostilities and the type of outcome. The authors examine empirically the effect of <b>third-party</b> <b>intervention</b> into civil wars during the period 1816 – 1997, using the event history framework of competing risks. From the perspective of competing risks, as a civil war endures, it is at risk of experi-encing a transition to one of three civil war outcomes in our sample: military victory by the gov-ernment, military victory by the opposition group, and negotiated settlement. The competing risks approach provides considerably better leverage on the dynamic qualities of civil wars and, in par-ticular, the influence of interventions by third parties. The analysis suggests that third-party inter-ventions can be decisive in the evolution of civil wars and that third-party interventions have a different effect on the duration than different civil war outcomes. The results show that <b>third-party</b> <b>intervention</b> decreases the time until the supported group achieves military victory. Furthermore, third-party interventions, on both the government and opposition sides, increase the time until a negotiated settlement. * Dylan Balch-Lindsay, our co-author and friend, passe...|$|E

Peacekeeping is the use of lightly armed troops to manage conflict in a war zone. Most peacekeeping has been done by the United Nations, drawing on the military forces of its members. Traditional peacekeeping involved enforcing ceasefires, but in the last few years, the peacekeeper's duties have grown to include such services as the delivery of humanitarian aid, the supervision of elections, and maintenance of law and order. Research shows that as they go about these new responsibilities, peacekeepers - officers more so than enlisted men - often become heavily involved in negotiation and mediation. One study found that as conflict becomes more severe, peacekeeper mediators are more likely to meet separately with the disputants, to urge the disputants to relax, and to rely on force (Wall, Druckman, & Diehl, 2002).|$|R
