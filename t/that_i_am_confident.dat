60|$|But {{enthusiasm is}} none of his Lordship's faculty: I am {{inclined}} to believe he might be melancholy enough when he writ this Introduction: The despair at his age of seeing a faction restored, to which he hath sacrificed so great {{a part of his}} life: The little success he can hope for in case he should resume those High-Church Principles, in defence of which he first employed his pen: No visible expectation of removing to Farnham or Lambeth: And lastly, the misfortune of being hated by every one, who either wears the habit, or values the profession of a clergyman: No wonder such a spirit, in such a situation, is provoked beyond the regards of truth, decency, religion, or self-conviction. To do him justice, he seems to have nothing else left, but to cry out, halters, gibbets, faggots, inquisition, Popery, slavery, and the Pretender. But in the meantime, he little considers what a world of mischief he does to his cause. It is very convenient, for the present designs of that faction, to spread the opinion of our immediate danger from Popery and the Pretender. His directors therefore ought, in my humble opinion, to have employed his Lordship in publishing a book, wherein he should have asserted, by the most solemn asseverations, that all things were safe and well; for the world has contracted so strong a habit of believing him backwards, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confident,</b> nine parts in ten of those who have read or heard of his Introduction, have slept in greater security ever since.

30|$|A GLM {{was used}} to explore whether a change towards {{agreement}} {{with each of the}} confidence statements in section B was associated with a change in the students’ test scores (section A).

This suggests that greater confidence in using this plan was associated with a jump in the post-test score.|$|R

In a word, his Zeal has been so constant and effectual in advancing all good and profitable Arts, that as one of the Antient Romans said of Scipio, That he thanked God that he was a Roman; because whereever Scipio had been born, there had been the seat of the Empire of the world: So may I thank God, that Dr. Wilkins was an Englishman, for whereever he had lived, there had been the chief Seat of generous Knowledge and true Philosophy.

It is certain that they get tired, and I could not blame them if they were glad to be rid of their guests, and to go back to their own social life.

I kept them in a glass of sea water till the 29 th, when an unfortunate accident killed them, and having only a small magnifying glass, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> prevented from making a full examination of all.

40|$|I år 2000 besluttet det norske Luftforsvaret å starte implementeringen av BSCfor blant annet å få bedre hånd om styringen av egen virksomhet og for åunderlette den betydelige omstillingen organisasjonen måtte gjennomføre. Åretetter besluttet FSJ at modellen skulle innføres i hele Forsvarets organisasjonmed Luftforsvarets implementeringsprosess som pilotprosjekt. BSC-litteraturenangir gjennomgående en hel rekke {{normative}} elementer for å få til en vellykketimplementering av BSC og jeg har gjennom studier av denne litteraturenidentifisert ni suksesskriterier som i størst mulig grad må innfris for å leggeforholdene til rette for en slik implementering. Jeg har videre gjennom en casestudieanalysert prosessen i Luftforsvaret opp mot disse suksesskriteriene i denhensikt å predikere hvorvidt pilotprosjektet i Luftforsvaret ville kunne væregrunnlag for en vellykket BSC-implementering i Forsvarets øvrigeorganisasjon. Mine analyser konkluderer med at grunnlaget for en vellykketimplementering er til stede, men at det er en del forhold som må vies betydeligoppmerksomhet i den fortsatte implementeringsprosessen. De fire kanskjeviktigste forholdene er behovet for et belønnings- og incentivsystem,integreringen med andre strategiske managementsystemer, koplingen tiloverordnet nivå (FSJ) og håndteringen av gradert materiale i BSC-strukturen. In {{my thesis}} I {{have studied the}} BSC-implementation process in the Norwegian ArmedForces. By analysing the process in the Air Force my intention has been to predict thelikelihood of a successful implementation {{in the rest of}} the Armed Forces. Theorganization is generally facing considerable cut-backs and new requirements formanaging their business and operations. In order both to link business and operationsand to meet these requirements, to implement strategies, to be more result oriented,and to manage changes in a better way, Kaplan and Norton’s BSC-model is beingintroduced. First it has been implemented in the Air Force as a pilot project and later,based on the experiences from this pilot project, it will be implemented full scale inthe rest of the Armed Forces. Both processes have commenced, but the Air Force isgenerally considerably ahead of the rest of the Armed Forces. Putting BSC into actionis a complicated process regardless of where and when it is being carried out. Areasonable amount of literature has prevailed since the “birth” of the model, most of itbased on Kaplan and Norton’s BSC-model. Being a model originally developed forprivate enterprises, I first of all have concluded that there nevertheless are no majorbarriers for also utilizing BSC in public sector generally and in the Norwegian ArmedForces especially. A number of non-profit organizations have allready been reportingsuccessful implementations across continents. Basically all the mentioned literaturedescribes a recipe - a set of requirements and demands - for putting BSC successfullyinto action. In my thesis I have identified a total number of nine criteria or groups ofcriteria that I have found to be decisive. These nine I have called successcriteria. Withrespect to these nine criteria I have carried out a case-study aiming at picturing howthe Norwegian Air Force as a pilot project has implemented BSC so far. This studyhas comprised interviews, meetings and written contact with centrally positionedpersonnel involved in the BSC-implementation, participation in internal meetings andstudy of information material and surveys already conducted. The study has given mea comprehensive picture of how the process is being carried out in the Air Force. Inmy analysis I have compared the ongoing process to the identified sucesscriteria. Based on the results I have concluded that not everything is done “by the book”. There are others, but I have especially highlighted four challenges which need to beaddressed; the need for a reward- and punishment systems, integration with otherstrategic management systems, the link to the level above the Air Force (COS), andthe handling of classified information in the BSC-structure. I have concluded that theexperiences from introducing BSC in the Air Force in broad terms can be utilized as abasis for further implementation in the Armed Forces’ organization. The mentionedshortcomings or challenges need to be addressed, but they are probably not of acharacter or of a magnitude that will be capable of jeopardizing the furtherimplementation. These shortcommings and challenges being faced successfully I haveconcluded <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confident</b> the planned full scale implementation will be successfuland that it will prepare the basis for maximizing the effect of efforts put into BSC inthe Norwegian Armed Forces.

6000|$|There {{is another}} thing in which I have presumed to deviate from him and Spenser. They both make hemistichs, or half-verses, {{breaking}} off {{in the middle of}} a line. <b>I</b> confess there <b>are</b> not many such in the [...] "Faerie Queen," [...] and even those few might be occasioned by his unhappy choice of so long a stanza. Mr. Cowley had found out that no kind of staff is proper for an heroic poem, as being all too lyrical; yet though he wrote in couplets, where rhyme is freer from constraint, he frequently affects half-verses, of which we find not one in Homer, and I think not in any of the Greek poets or the Latin, excepting only Virgil: and there is no question but he thought he had Virgil's authority for <b>that</b> licence. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confident</b> our poet never meant to leave him or any other such a precedent; and I ground my opinion on these two reasons: first, we find no example of a hemistich in any of his Pastorals or Georgics, for he had given the last finishing strokes to both these poems; but his [...] "AEneis" [...] he left so incorrect, at least so short of that perfection at which he aimed, that we know how hard a sentence he passed upon it.

I must see with my own eyes, I must, in a manner, touch with my own hands, not only the fixed, but the momentary circumstances, before I could venture to suggest any political project whatsoever. I must know the power and disposition to accept, to execute, to persevere. I must see all the aids and all the obstacles. I must see the means of correcting the plan, where correctives would <b>be</b> wanted. <b>I</b> must see the things; I must see the men. Without a concurrence and adaptation of these to the design, the very best speculative projects might become not only useless, but mischievous. Plans must be made for men. We cannot think of making men, and binding Nature to our designs. People at a distance must judge ill of men. They do not always answer to their reputation, when you approach them. Nay, the perspective varies, and shows them quite otherwise than you thought them. At a distance, if we judge uncertainly of men, we must judge worse of opportunities, which continually vary their shapes and colors, and pass away like clouds. The Eastern politicians never do anything without {{the opinion of the}} astrologers on the fortunate moment. They are in the right, if they can do no better; for the opinion of fortune is something towards commanding it. Statesmen of a more judicious prescience look for the fortunate moment too; but they seek it, not in the conjunctions and oppositions of planets, but in the conjunctions and oppositions of men and things. These form their almanac.|$|R

I remember, when we first mounted that celebrated pass in the Mysore country, while most of the others felt only awe and astonishment at the height and grandeur of the scenery, I rather shared your feelings and those of Cameron, whose admiration of such wild rocks was blended with familiar love, derived from early association.
