5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{are given}} an {{injection}} of venom {{under the skin}} in small amounts.

5|$|Semantic {{memory is}} the ability to learn facts and relationships. <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> memory is {{probably}} stored largely in the cerebral cortex, mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information.|$|E

5|$|Working {{memory is}} the ability of the brain to {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.|$|E
5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E
5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} contract on his behalf with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

5|$|The 1960 SOLAS Convention {{sought to}} control <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> problem. These {{regulations}} required the upper ballast tanks designed {{in a manner}} to prevent shifting. They also required cargoes to be leveled, or trimmed, using excavators in the holds. The practice of trimming reduces {{the amount of the}} cargo's surface area in contact with air which has a useful side-effect: reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in cargoes such as coal, iron, and metal shavings.|$|E
5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if a measure of 5feet is extended by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches is synonymous with 5feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|E

5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} change is to admit more permanent members. The candidates usually mentioned are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. They comprise {{the group of}} G4 nations, mutually supporting one another's bids for permanent seats. The United Kingdom, France and Russia support G4 membership in the U.N. Security Council. <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> reform has traditionally been opposed by the Uniting for Consensus group, which is composed primarily of nations who are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4. The group is led by Italy and Spain (opposing Germany), Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina (opposing Brazil), Pakistan (opposing India), and South Korea (opposing Japan), in addition to Turkey, Indonesia and others. Since 1992, Italy {{and other members of}} the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair {{and maintain the}} property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair.|$|E

5|$|Sulu-type {{compositions}} on the kulintangan {{are found}} among the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though there exist no identifiable rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{completion}} of the fort did have some drawbacks, however. The fort lacked some of the refinements that would be present at later forts like Fort Foote. In 1864, civil engineer William C. Gunnell requested {{the removal of the}} wooden buildings that served as company quarters at Fort Greble so that the ammunition for the fort could be safely placed in magazines to be built in place of the shanties. There simply had not been time in 1861 to construct proper earthen magazines. <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> constant renovation and improvement would continue throughout the war as forts were adapted to new purposes and new garrisons.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
500|$|Prisoners {{arriving}} in camps {{were divided into}} groups by the Germans. Mostly, this consisted of bringing soldiers of similar backgrounds (Communists, Jews or Bretons) together for administrative purposes and to limit their interaction with other prisoners. Although <b>this</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> soldiers generally occurred {{on a small scale}} only, a camp was established at Lübeck for French prisoners dubbed [...] "enemies of the Reich", where they could be detained in isolation. Prisoners considered rebellious, however, were often sent to special camps in which conditions were extremely poor.|$|R

Since volumetric data has no limitation regarding {{the shape of the}} object that ordinary mesh algorithms has we can fully reconstruct anything using the Marching cubes algorithm.

50|$|Perceptual {{categorization}} is said {{to occur}} when a person or animal responds {{in a similar way}} to a range of stimuli that share common features. For example, a squirrel climbs a tree when it sees Rex, Shep, or Trixie, which suggests that it categorizes all three as something to avoid. <b>This</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> instances into groups is crucial to survival. Among other things, an animal must categorize if it is to apply learning about one object (e.g. Rex bit me) to new instances of that category (dogs may bite).|$|R
