5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it {{should be seen as}} distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm chaser deaths, Kansas Emergency Management Association {{president}} Brian Stone called for there to be regulations put on future storm chasing; however, he stated that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> as to how it would actually be implemented. AccuWeather Senior Vice President Mike Smith urged against overreacting to their deaths, citing that they were the first chasers to be killed in 40years of the practice and that chasing as a whole is a significant source of real-time and research information.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> {{about the}} {{external}} {{validity of the}} AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E

Although the Olmecs {{are considered to be}} perhaps the earliest Mesoamerican civilization, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> concerning how and how much the Olmecs influenced cultures outside the Olmec heartland. This debate is succinctly, if simplistically, framed by the title of a 2005 New York Times article: “Mother Culture, or Only a Sister?”.|$|E

The airport's present terminal and runway layout are reaching full utilization and PHL remains the world's largest airport without an inground fueling system thus requiring fuel to be trucked to each airplane. These two factors have led to congestion and delays. Additionally, the airport's parking facilities have been severely taxed. Exhaustion of all 17,000 parking spaces at the airport has become a regular occurrence. However, airport officials have ambitious plans for terminal and runway expansion.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{reported}} effect of culture on performance is that strong cultures result in high performance. The three {{reasons for this}} are goal alignment, motivation, and the resulting structure provided. Goal alignment {{is driven by the}} proposed unified voice that drives employees in the same direction. Motivation comes from the strength of values and principles in such a culture. And structure is provided by these same attributes which obviate the need for formal controls that could stifle employees. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> that concern researchers about causality and the veracity of the driving voice of a strong culture.|$|E

Another important aspect of Chu Ci studies is the editorial history. One regard is the order in which the various titles appear. There are also reasons to believe that some of the sections (juan) were subject to editing for various reasons, including to suit the verses to theatrical performance and {{due to the nature of}} the textual process of ancient China, involving writing lines of text on individual bamboo strips which were bound together, but when the bindings broke were subject to editorial decisions as to what their original order was.|$|E
25|$|Mexican state social {{investment}} depends to a {{great extent}} on the profits from oil exports controlled by Pemex as a state monopoly. The leftist political movement National Regeneration Movement has expressed concern that Pemex will be systematically excluded as a commercial competitor by the government. They believe that Pemex's infrastructural decline was due to a deliberate strategy of self-sabotage by the government through lack of reinvestment, and fear that the Mexican oil rent may be taken over by private corporations. The leftist opposition is concerned that energy reform may be a concealed maneuver for privatization. They also worry that laws derived from the constitutional reforms are not explicit in demonstrating that energy reform will avoid having the oil rent be controlled by the private sector. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> as to how the Mexican system of public health, education and subsidized transportation (not to mention the newly created presidential fund for retirement and umemployment) would be funded if there is privatization of the oil rent.|$|E
500|$|Section 1 of the Act {{allows a}} third party to enforce terms of a {{contract}} in one of two situations: firstly if he is specifically mentioned in the contract as someone authorised to do so, and secondly if the contract [...] "purports to confer a benefit" [...] on him. An exception to the second rule is if the contract makes it clear that the third party is not meant to be able to enforce the term. In Nisshin Shipping Co Ltd v Cleaves & Co Ltd [...] EWHC 2602 the High Court decided that in situations where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> over whether or not the second rule has been disapplied by a statement in the contract, the onus is on the party claiming that it has been disapplied.

500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.|$|E
500|$|Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo, and Masashi Hamauzu {{created the}} {{arrangements}} for the concert. Valtonen and Wanamo had previously worked with Böcker on the concerts in the Symphonic series, and Böcker has stated {{that if they had}} been unavailable for the project he would not have created Final Symphony at all. Hamauzu, in addition to arranging the Final Fantasy X music, was one of the composers of the original pieces he arranged. Uematsu, who composed music for all three games, served as a consultant for the project, though he did not arrange any pieces. When they first began the project, Böcker, Valtonen, and Wanamo took a few months to play through the games, watch playthrough videos, and read reviews and analyses of the games. They did not research other arrangements that have been done of the pieces, as they feel the general approach to video game music orchestration is very different from their style. They then got together to propose which tracks would be arranged, and decide which soundtracks worked best as a piano concerto, a symphonic poem, or a symphony. They chose a symphonic poem for VI, a piano concerto for X, and a symphony in three movements for VII. Böcker gave the team direction, and coordinated the arrangers in discussing and deciding which tracks to arrange. During the process of actually creating the arrangements, however, Böcker was not involved; he feels that the arrangers are [...] "masters of their art" [...] and should have the freedom to create what they want. Nevertheless, the arrangers were communicating via e-mail sharing their work in progress with Böcker: [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions,</b> or if they wish to know my opinion, I am there".|$|E
