500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> you through life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was like that when I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E

Games marketed as Xbox One X Enhanced have specific optimizations for graphical fidelity on the console's hardware, while separate iconography {{is being used to}} denote games that natively run at 4K resolution, or support HDR. Existing games may receive updates to provide enhancements or additional 4K support for Xbox One X. Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow-up interview that he was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be [...] "up to the game development community what do they want to do." [...] Spencer also touted that Xbox One X's hardware could also be used to support virtual reality, noting that especially at a console price point, [...] "having something at six teraflops <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> millions of people buying it is very attractive to some of the VR companies that are out there already, and we've architected it such that something will be able to plug right in and work." [...] However, Microsoft has not yet announced any official plans for VR support on Xbox One X, stating that it wished to prioritize wireless VR efforts on console, and Windows Mixed Reality on PC.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called it [...] "mediocre".

Adam Rayner of Obsessed with Film criticized the episode's references to Indecent Proposal, calling it a [...] "rip-off" [...] of the film. Furthermore, he wrote that the episode [...] "manages to be worse [...] that dire movie [...]" [...] Nate Boss of Project-Blu also criticized the episode's similarity to Indecent Proposal, calling it [...] "late to the party". He wrote: [...] "Like South Park imitating the WWE in its 13th year, about 12 years past when it hit its prime, The Simpsons makes an Indecent Proposal themed episode." [...] Boss also described the episode as [...] "played out," [...] and criticized it for having [...] "unfunny characters (Artie Ziff), who appear far more often than they should." [...] In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean defended The Simpsons writers' choice to base the episode's story on Indecent Proposal, eight years after the movie was released. He argued that rather than lampooning a current film <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> parodied on other television shows anyway, it is more [...] "interesting" [...] to make an episode based on a story that [...] "people may not be familiar with".|$|E

[...] This is known as consumerism because the media influences society's emotions to think of the rivalries in a way <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> people to be as passionate about the game as they want to be.

2500|$|Smukler {{enrolled}} in the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, and played fullback under Frank Carideo. He left before the year ended and continued to learn glove cutting under his brother Lewis. In September 1933 Smukler transferred to Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was chosen to play varsity fullback by Glenn “Pop” Warner one year later. After Smukler helped the Temple Owls achieve many wins, Warner stated, “He is a better fullback now than Ernie Nevers was in Nevers’s sophomore year. Dave is the best sophomore fullback I have ever seen. He may become the greatest fullback I have ever seen, a greater football player than Nevers or Jim Thorpe.” The coach also commended him as a defensive player, kicker, and forward passer, stating that “he combines fine judgment with his versatility. [...] He is not the type <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> puffed up by praise, either.” Smukler played five consecutive games without ever letting the ball slip from his hand.|$|E

[...] Other accounts indicate that he never achieved great success as an athlete. A friend of Murphy, Pat Hurley, recalled that Murphy's days as a trainer began when Mike Finn, the fleetest professional sprinter in New England, received a letter from New Haven asking him to act as a trainer there. Finn reportedly joked to a group of athletes, [...] "Let's send 'Stocky' Murphy." [...] Because Murphy was not a champion among them, Finn's comments brought a [...] "round of jeers."

[...] Jesus Freak Hideout contends [...] "While all too many rock outfits are trading their chugging riffs for more modest melodies and radio-friendly cuts, it's exciting to hear a band like Disciple continuing on and just being themselves, all the while carrying the flag into battle {{in the name of}} Christ."

[...] Hardeep Phull of the New York Post criticized the song's similar production to [...] "Fancy" [...] and described it as [...] "a woefully formulaic rehash."

Luke wears a checked blue shirt (a plain blue shirt in most, though not all, second-season episodes) and a denim jacket over it in first season and a few later second-season which means he wears Double Denim episodes and he also wears Dark Blue jeans with a belt with a fish belt buckle with black boots and later brown boots {{and a few other}} checker and plaid shirts in later episodes and seasons of the show. He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former boxer. Luke was the first Duke to perform the [...] "hood slide" [...] across The General Lee, which is seen in the opening credits of the show (a shot taken from the second episode, [...] "Daisy's Song") and later told by Tom Wopat to be an accident, because his foot got caught {{on the side of the}} General Lee when he attempted to jump across the hood; he also caught his thigh on the hood's radio antenna, cutting himself, resulting in such antennas being removed from later versions of the General Lee which those later versions looked similar to the ones in The Dukes of Hazzard film. However, the [...] "hood slide" [...] quickly proved popular and became a regular staple of episodes. The only episode to directly reference the age difference between Luke and Bo is in the seventh season opener, the [...] "flashback" [...] episode [...] "Happy Birthday, General Lee," [...] where it is stated that Luke had already been in the Marines while Bo was in his last year at high school. Though Bo and Luke share the CB call sign [...] "Lost Sheep," [...] in Season One episode [...] "Money to Burn," [...] Luke referred to himself (singularly) as [...] "Sittin' Duck." ...|$|E
