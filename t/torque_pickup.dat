5000|$|The Vortec 5300 LC9 (VIN code [...] "3") is the {{aluminum}} block Flex-Fuel {{version of the}} LH6, and is found in 4WD models. SUV applications are rated at [...] @ 5400 rpm and 335 lbft Nm @ 4000 rpm of <b>torque.</b> <b>Pickup</b> truck applications are rated at [...] @ 5300 rpm and 335 lbft Nm @ 4000 rpm of torque. Variable valve timing was added for the 2010 model year.|$|E
40|$|The brush shaft {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} {{sections}} (56) matching the number of roller sections (58). The concentric roller and shaft sections are joined by peripherally flexible, radial spacer pieces (60) which are axially and radially rigid. The torque pickups have a weighing cell protruding radially beyond the appropriate shaft section towards the roller section, as well as a tension member extending tangentially towards the direction of rotation and positioned between the weighing cell and the inside of the appropriate roller section. ADVANTAGE - The <b>torque</b> <b>pickup</b> for automatically guiding the brush head on the surface being cleaned operates reliably...|$|E
40|$|An {{instrumentation}} {{system is designed}} to measure the field performance parameters {{of the most common}} agricultural tractors and implements. The package is designed such that it can be shifted from one to another easily. Transducers such as load cell, PTa (Power Take Off) <b>torque</b> transducer, magnetic <b>pickups,</b> fuel flow sensor, and PRTs (Platinum Resistance Thermometers) are used to measure drawbar pull, PTa torque and speed, tractor speed and slip, fuel flow, engine speed, and temperatures of fuel and engine. Signals from the transducers are scanned and recorded using a datalogger...|$|R
