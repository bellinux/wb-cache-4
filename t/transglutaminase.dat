25|$|In {{the case}} of celiac disease, the current {{understanding}} is that tTG autoimmunity arises when T-cells are generated against wheat gliadin and similar gluten proteins made by a class of grasses called Triticeae, which includes wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye. The T-cells are defined by the ability to react to HLA-DQ8 and DQ2.5 restricted antigens and gliadin {{is one of the}} antigens. Gliadin is a favored dietary substrate for <b>transglutaminase</b> because of many enzyme reaction sites on gliadin. In disease, <b>transglutaminase</b> reacts with gliadin forming a linkage. In forming this bond <b>transglutaminase</b> becomes linked to T-cell epitopes on gliadin. B-cells with surface IgM that react to <b>transglutaminase</b> can present it with bound gliadin peptides to T-cells which stimulate B-cell maturation and proliferation to plasma cells making IgA or IgM.|$|E

40|$|In nature, <b>transglutaminases</b> {{catalyze}} {{the formation}} of amide bonds between proteins to form insoluble protein aggregates. This specific function has long been exploited in the food and textile industries as a protein cross-linking agent to alter the texture of meat, wool, and leather. In recent years, biotechnological applications of <b>transglutaminases</b> have come to light in areas ranging from material sciences to medicine. There {{has also been a}} substantial effort to further investigate the fundamentals of <b>transglutaminases,</b> as many of their characteristics that remain poorly understood. Those studies also work towards the goal of developing <b>transglutaminases</b> as more efficient catalysts.

40|$|In pollen tubes, {{cytoskeleton}} proteins {{are involved}} in many aspects of pollen germination and growth, from the transport of sperm cells to the asymmetrical distribution of organelles to the deposition of cell wall material. These activities {{are based on the}} dynamics of the cytoskeleton. Changes to both actin filaments and microtubules are triggered by specific proteins, resulting in different organization levels suitable for the different functions of the cytoskeleton. <b>Transglutaminases</b> are enzymes ubiquitous in all plant organs and cell compartments. They catalyze the post-translational conjugation of polyamines to different protein targets, such as the cytoskeleton. <b>Transglutaminases</b> are suggested to have a general role in the interaction between pollen tubes and the extracellular matrix during fertilization and a specific role during the self-incompatibility response. In such processes, the activity of <b>transglutaminases</b> is enhanced, leading to the formation of cross-linked products (including aggregates of tubulin and actin). Consequently, <b>transglutaminases</b> are suggested to act as regulators of cytoskeleton dynamics. The distribution of <b>transglutaminases</b> in pollen tubes is affected by both membrane dynamics and the cytoskeleton. <b>Transglutaminases</b> are also secreted in the extracellular matrix, where they may take part in the assembly and/or strengthening of the pollen tube cell wall...|$|R

25|$|Antibody {{recognition}} of gluten is complex. Direct binding to gluten such as anti-gliadin antibodies has an ambiguous pathogenesis in coeliac disease. The crosslinking of gliadin with tissue <b>transglutaminase</b> {{leads to the}} production of anti-transglutaminase antibodies, but this is mediated through T-cell {{recognition of}} gliadin. The allergic recognition of gliadin by mast cells, eosinophiles in the presence of IgE has notable direct consequences, such as exercise-induced anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibodies}} to tissue <b>transglutaminase</b> follow a complex pathway of generation. For most antigens, T-cells specific to those antigens develop; for autoimmunity, either autoreactive T-cells are not suppressed, or antigens escape the protective process. T-cells are stimulated by antigen, presented by MHC molecules (HLA in humans) on antigen-reactive B-cells. These T-helper cells then stimulate B-cells to multiply and mature into plasma cells that make IgA and IgG to that protein.|$|E

In wheat, the {{low molecular weight}} glutenins often share structural similarity with the prolamins of the similar species of Triticeae.

40|$|Terminally {{differentiated}} stratified {{squamous epithelium}} forms a {{lining of the}} plasma membrane called the cornified cell envelope, {{a thick layer of}} several covalently cross-linked precursor proteins including involucrin, small proline-rich proteins, and loricrin. Their cross-linking isodipeptide bonds are formed by epidermal <b>transglutaminases</b> 1 - 3. Material from lamellar granules is attached on the extracellular surface of corneocytes during the keratinization process. The formation of cornified cell envelope and sequential expression of major cornified cell envelope precursor proteins, <b>transglutaminases,</b> and 25 kDa lamellar granule-associated protein were studied in human embryonic and fetal skin. Ultrastructurally, membrane thickening has already started in periderm cells of the two-layered epidermis and an electron-dense, thickened cell envelope similar to cornified cell envelope in adult epidermis is observed in periderm cells at the three-layered and later stages of skin development. In the two-layered epidermis (49 - 65 d estimated gestational age), immunoreactivities of involucrin, small proline-rich proteins, all the <b>transglutaminases,</b> and lamellar granule-associated protein were present only in the periderm. In the three-layered epidermis and thereafter (66 - 160 d estimated gestational age), loricrin became positive in the periderm cells, <b>transglutaminases</b> extended to the entire epidermis, and lamellar granule-associated protein was detected in intermediate cells as well as periderm cells. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that both major cornified cell envelope precursor proteins, involucrin and loricrin, were restricted to the cornified cell envelope in periderm cells at this stage of development. After 160 d estimated gestational age, the periderm had disappeared and cornified cell envelope proteins and lamellar granule-associated proteins were expressed in the spinous, granular, and cornified cells and <b>transglutaminases</b> were detected in the entire epidermis. These findings indicate that cornified cell envelope precursor proteins, <b>transglutaminases,</b> and lamellar granule-associated proteins are expressed in coordination in periderm cells during human epidermal development and suggest that periderm cells form cornified cell envelope in the process of regression...|$|R

25|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of Triticeae glutens {{is important}} in several inflammatory diseases. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), class II mediated presentation (HLA DQ), class I meditiated stimulation of killer cells, and antibody recognition. The responses to gluten proteins and polypeptide regions differs according {{to the type of}} gluten sensitivity. The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and <b>transglutaminase.</b> With idiopathic gluten sensitivity only antibody recognition to gliadin has been resolved. In wheat allergy, the response pathways are mediated through IgE against other wheat proteins and other forms of gliadin.|$|E
25|$|A puzzling {{feature of}} the {{documented}} loss of tolerance seen in spontaneous human autoimmunity {{is that it is}} almost entirely restricted to the autoantibody responses produced by B lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance by T cells has been extremely hard to demonstrate, and where there is evidence for an abnormal T cell response it is usually not to the antigen recognised by autoantibodies. Thus, in rheumatoid arthritis there are autoantibodies to IgG Fc but apparently no corresponding T cell response. In systemic lupus there are autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot evoke a T cell response, and limited evidence for T cell responses implicates nucleoprotein antigens. In Celiac disease there are autoantibodies to tissue <b>transglutaminase</b> but the T cell response is to the foreign protein gliadin. This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases (with probable exceptions including type I diabetes) based on a loss of B cell tolerance which makes use of normal T cell responses to foreign antigens in a variety of aberrant ways.|$|E
500|$|Researchers at the University of Maine have {{actively}} {{been developing}} value-added green crab products, {{with the goals}} of driving business interest, stimulating a commercial green crab fishery, and alleviating predation effects. Specifically, one study evaluated the consumer acceptability of empanadas (fried, stuffed pastries) which contained varying amounts of green crab mince meat. It was reported that the empanadas were rated between [...] "like slightly" [...] and [...] "like moderately" [...] for overall acceptability by a consumer panel (n=87). Furthermore, about two-thirds of the panelists would [...] "probably" [...] or [...] "definitely" [...] buy the empanadas if available locally. [...] Additionally, the same researchers developed a patty product made from green crab mince meat using restructuring additives (<b>transglutaminase,</b> dried egg white, isolated soy protein). It was reported that although a successful green crab patty was developed, the restructuring additives may have had greater functionality in a raw crab meat system, as opposed to the fully cooked mince that was utilized in the present study. The results from both studies are considered promising, especially considering that these were initial rounds of green crab product development.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} whether the protein crosslinking enzymes, <b>transglutaminases,</b> {{had the potential to}} be used as tanning agents, using native bovine hide and purified soluble rat tail collagen as real and model substrates, respectively. We demonstrate that <b>transglutaminases</b> (TGs) were capable of covalently crosslinking collagen molecules together such that on average every collagen molecule contained at least one epsilon(gamma-glutamyl) lysine crosslink. However, transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking did not affect the denaturation temperature of either native bovine hide or soluble rat tail collagens when used in isolation or together with other proteins and bifunctional diamines as crosslinking facilitators. In an initial study into the effect of TG-mediated crosslinking on the tensile strength of chrome-tanned bovine hide, such crosslinking led to a 30 per cent decrease in tensile strength. Despite a change in the gel melting point mediated by epsilon(gamma-glutamyl) lysine crosslinking, the use of <b>transglutaminases</b> as alternative tanning agents seems unlikely given the present data...|$|R

40|$|Fertilization is {{accompanied}} by {{the construction of an}} extracellular matrix that protects the new zygote. In sea urchins, this structure is built from glycoproteins residing at the egg surface and in secretory vesicles at the egg cortex. Four enzymatic activities are required for the transformation of these proteins into the mechanically and chemically resilient fertilization envelope: proteolysis, transamidation, NADPH-dependent oxidation and peroxidation. Here, we identify the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus enzymes responsible for the formation of ε(γ-glutamyl) lysine crosslinks (transamidation). We find that these two <b>transglutaminases</b> are activated by local acidification and act on specific substrates within the fertilization envelope (including ovoperoxidase, rendezvin and SFE 9). Surprisingly, these enzymes also regulate dityrosine crosslinking both by direct conjugation of ovoperoxidase and by modulating hydrogen peroxide production. Together, these results emphasize how <b>transglutaminases</b> can coordinate the activities of other enzymes during extracellular matrix transmogrifications...|$|R

40|$|Congenital {{recessive}} ichthyosis has a {{broad range}} of clinical presentations, which may be considered a spectrum of phenotypes with classic lamellar ichthyosis at one pole and classic congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma at the other. The identification of mutations in the transglutaminase- 1 gene as a cause of lamellar ichthyosis implicates transglutaminase- 1 in other congenital recessive ichthyoses. We investigated two multiplex families with clinical manifestations between the two poles for linkage to the transglutaminase- 1 locus on thromesome 14. Strongly negative lod scores prompted a search for linkage to two other epidermally expressed <b>transglutaminases,</b> transglutaminase- 2 and transglutaminase- 3, on chromosome 20. No evidence for linkage was found.

We report two Japanese DH cases with typical clinical, histological and direct immunofluorescence features. However, no symptom of gluten-sensitive enteropathy was shown. The diagnosis was confirmed by eliminating other autoimmune blistering diseases by indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting.

While the roles of MMPs are now understood in detail and represent a promising target for pharmacological interventions, much less is known on the roles of <b>transglutaminases</b> in vascular biology. These last enzymes are expressed at extremely high levels in endothelial cells and are involved in cell matrix interactions important to angiogenesis and apoptosis/cell death of endothelial cells, in the control of blood clotting and and in the transfer of molecules and cells across the vascular walls.
