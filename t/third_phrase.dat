50|$|Following the Civil War, {{a form of}} song {{developed}} with some distinctive characteristics that may be of ancient origin, perhaps related to the call-and-response format. These songs consisted of three 4-bar phrases. The first two were identical and described a problem, beginning on the implied tonic and subdominant harmonies respectively. The <b>third</b> <b>phrase</b> indicates {{a reaction to the}} problem described and begins on the implied dominant harmony. All three phrases cadence on a sustained tonic occupying the third and fourth bar.|$|E

50|$|Theme II (Moderato assai) {{consists}} of two principal motives too. The first is a chromatic gradually ascending sinister line on bassoons and clarinets accompanied by string tremolandi; the second is a descending complement (which {{is derived from the}} Gregorian Dies irae). The first statement of Theme II presents three phrases (bars 37-46, 47-60, 61-70). It is throughout chromatic except for the second motif of the first phrase, when a B minor harmonized theme of the Dies irae appears (it is the only instance when it can be easily recognized). This dominant collapses into further ambiguity without resolution. The <b>third</b> <b>phrase</b> of Theme II rises it to a screeching pitch. It is defused by a codetta.|$|E
50|$|Tirana {{kicked off}} March by losing 1-0 against Skënderbeu Korçë. On 8 March, Tirana {{returned}} to the winning ways by defeating the title contenders Kukësi 2-0 at Niko Dovana Stadium thanks to the goals of Tomislav Bušić and Gjergji Muzaka, who scored {{for the first time}} since his return to the club. However, this win did not bring joy to the team as they lost the postponed Capital Derby for the second consecutive time against Partizani Tirana, who won 2-1. The team's goalkeeper Stivi Frashëri criticised too much after the match, where also the coach Gugash Magani declared that Frashëri can not cope with such pressure match. Tirana ended the <b>third</b> <b>phrase</b> of the league by equaling with the struggling side Teuta Durrës. Tirana started the fourth and the last phrase of the league in strong fashion, beating 2-0 away Apolonia with the goals of Morina and Muça.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1600, a <b>third</b> <b>phrase</b> that Le Roy Ladurie called [...] "maturity" [...] set in. In the 17th century, the {{population}} finally grew {{level with the}} productivity {{of the land in}} Languedoc. Contrary to Marxist historians, Le Roy Ladurie argued that there was little accumulation of wealth as continuing agrarian conservatism and the drastic increase in what Le Roy Ladurie called [...] "parasitic phenomena" [...] both retarded efforts to build up capital. The [...] "parasitic phenomena" [...] were the increasing taxes levied by the French Crown combined with increased tithes demanded by the Catholic Church and increased rents by landlords {{while at the same time}} many Languedoc peasants went deeply into debt in an effort to pay all of these taxes, tithes and rents. The adverse climate of the 17th century as the Little Ice Age was at its height together with the fact that France was constantly at war in the 17th century further contributed to the increasing misery of the peasantry of Languedoc.|$|E
50|$|A {{gag order}} (also {{known as a}} gagging order or {{suppression}} order) is an order, typically a legal order by a court or government, restricting information or comment from being made public or passed onto any unauthorized <b>third</b> party.

40|$|The term 2 morae unit {{is often}} used when {{linguists}} discuss the Japanese rhythm. The 5 - 7 - 5 syllable HAIKU is also analyzed by this term. In this case, a pause between each phrase {{is regarded as a}} feature of the unit (5 [p] 7 [p] 5 [p]), and the 5 - 7 - 5 unit becomes an even-numbered sequence. However HAIKU is usually read aloud like 5 [p] 75, which means that there is no pause between the second and the <b>third</b> <b>phrases.</b> In this paper, the following hypothesis is discussed: ln the reading of HAIKU without the second pause, the 2 morae unit tends to be placed {{at the end of the}} second phrase. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, the reading of HAIKU in a TV program is analysed. The three standards of rhythm analysis adopted here are: (1) an automatic rhythm segmentation, (2) a rhythm segmentation for the semantic consideration, (3) control of the pronunciation possibility. In the last standard, the possibility means that a dephthongized mora or a vowel devoicing mora functions as an adjacent consonant of a syllable. The finding of this analysis is that the case of reading without a pause increases according to the order of the above mentioned (1) < (2) < (3). So does the percentage of the case of the unit 2 at the end of the second phrase by the same order. This means that there is a little relation between the control of pronunciation possibility and the reading of HAIKU without a pause...|$|R
50|$|Each large {{phrase of}} a twelve-bar blues is broken up into three sub-phrases {{consisting}} of four measures each. In the third sub-phrase, the third measure contains two harmonic possibilities. In {{the first and}} <b>third</b> twelve-bar <b>phrases</b> of Barber’s movement, the subdominant harmony (C) occurs after the dominant harmony (D); however, {{in the second and}} fourth twelve-bar phrases, the subdominant does not occur, but rather the tonic appears. The harmonic movement from V → IV → I, creating a plagal-type of cadence, is weaker than the V → V → I movement. When Barber uses this type of movement in the last 12-bar phrase, it creates a strong closing gesture. This is one way in which Barber strays from the typical twelve-bar blues form.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>third</b> <b>phrase</b> was {{the period}} of the Five-Year Plans {{beginning}} with the First Five-Year Plan in 1928, which saw the Soviet state promoting the growth of heavy industry, eliminating private enterprise, collectivising agriculture, and of quotas for industrial production being set in Moscow. In Carr's opinion, the changes wrought by the First Five Year Plan were a positive development. Carr argued that the economic system that existed during the N.E.P. period was highly inefficient, and that any economic system based on planning by the state was superior to what Carr saw as the disorganized chaos of capitalism. Carr accepted the Soviet claim that the so-called [...] "kulaks" [...] existed as a distinct class, that they were a negative social force, and as such, the [...] "dekulakisation" [...] campaign that saw at least 2 million alleged [...] "kulaks" [...] deported to the Gulag in 1930-32 was a necessary measure that improved the lives of the Soviet peasantry. R.W. Davies, Carr's associate and co-writer on the History of Soviet Russia, expressed some doubts to Carr about whatever the [...] "kulaks" [...] actually existed, and thought the term was more an invention of Soviet propaganda than a reflection of the social conditions in the Soviet countryside.|$|E
5000|$|The {{position}} of China on its maritime claims based on UNCLOS and {{history has been}} ambiguous, particularly with the nine dash line map. For example, in its notes verbales in 2011, the first phrase stated that China has undisputed sovereignty over the islands and the adjacent waters, suggesting China is claiming sovereignty over its territorial waters, a position consistent with UNCLOS. However, the second phrase in its notes verbales stated that China enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters along with the seabed and subsoil contained in this region, suggesting that China is claiming sovereignty over all of the maritime space (includes all the geographic features and the waters within the nine dash line). The <b>third</b> <b>phrase</b> indicates support for basing their claims on historical basis as well. Recently in its notes verbales in 2011, China has explicitly stated that it claims the territorial waters {{and all of the}} islands in which each island has its own exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. A major problem with this claim is that it fails to distinguish between geographic features considered as [...] "islands" [...] or [...] "rocks" [...] under UNCLOS. The vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China's claims based on historical claims are invalid. Many ambiguities arise from the notion of historical claims as a basis for claiming sovereignty and is inherently ambiguous.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interval}} of a tritone between C and F♯ is a recurring motif, {{the occurrence of}} which unifies the entire work. The interval is used both in contexts that emphasise the harmonic distance between C and F♯ and those that resolve them harmonically, mirroring the theme of conflict and reconciliation present throughout the work. The Requiem aeternam, Dies irae, and Libera me movements end in a brief choral phrase, consisting mainly of slow half notes, each first and second phrase ending on a tritone's discord, with every last (i. e. <b>third)</b> <b>phrase</b> resolving to an F major chord; while {{at the end of}} the Agnus Dei the tenor (in his only transition from the Owen poems to the Requiem liturgy, on the key words, Dona nobis pacem - Give us peace) outlines a perfect fifth from C to G before moving down to F♯ to resolve the chorus's final chord. At the end of the Dies irae, the tenor sings (from Owen's [...] "Futility") [...] "O what, what made fatuous sunbeams toil, to break earth's sleep at all?" [...] The notes of [...] "at all" [...] form the tritone and lead into the choir's formal resolution. In the final Owen setting, [...] "Strange Meeting", one of the most prominent expressions of the tritone is sung by the tenor, addressing an opposing soldier with the words [...] "Strange friend". This poem is accompanied by sporadic detached chords from two violins and a viola, which include the tritone as part of a dominant 7th chord. At the end of the poem, the final string chord resolves to the tonic, bringing the work to its final, reconciliatory In paradisum. On a more practical level, Britten facilitated musical execution of the tritone in the closing bars by having the F# sung in one voice, but the C in another.|$|E

To get timely information from monitored environment, a timely wireless senor network routing scheme (TNRS) is proposed, which is made up of three phrases: initial setup, route discovery and establishment, data communication and route maintenance.

30|$|<b>Third,</b> <b>phrase</b> {{extraction}} is used {{to extract}} some representative phrases from a document, and then to find related documents containing these representative phrases. Some works [28, 29] utilize statistical information to identify suitable phrases; some works [18] also leverage the relationships between phrases; some works [33, 34] apply learning algorithms in the extraction process. Mihalcea and Tarau [30] propose TextRank, a graph-based ranking model, for text processing such as keyword and sentence extraction. In keyword extraction setting, this algorithm takes as input a graph whose nodes correspond to words appearing in a target document. When two words co-occur within a window of a given width W, an edge is added between the nodes of these words. This algorithm then calculates PageRank scores of nodes for this graph and outputs N nodes having high scores as extracted keywords.|$|E

30|$|Li’s (1990) {{classification}} {{and analysis}} of the V-DE construction have the following shortcomings. First, the use of “descriptive” cannot really distinguish between the two types of V-DE constructions discussed by her, given the fact that a resultative expression of the V-DE construction is also a description of the result that arises from the eventuality expressed by the verb or adjective before -de.
