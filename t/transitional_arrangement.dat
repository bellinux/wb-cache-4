5|$|Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad {{remained}} {{under the}} rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for , with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the President of India. In 2014, the newly formed state of Telangana split from Andhra Pradesh and the city became the joint capital of the two states, a <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangement</b> scheduled to end by 2025.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the way {{in which}} labor is divided in the home is {{reflective}} of the work-family ideologies to which the husband and wife individually subscribe. Mary Blair-Loy identifies three of these ideologies: traditional, egalitarian, and transitional. The traditional family arrangement is the breadwinner-homemaker model of the 1950s in which women are expected to fully devote themselves to household management and childcare, while their husband’s earn the family income. The egalitarian arrangement entails that the husband and wife be equally active at home and in the workforce. The <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangement</b> allows for both husband and wife to be engaged in the workforce, with the wife taking on the bulk of the homemaking responsibilities. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls the additional time spent on housework “the second shift” for women. Families that adopt the <b>transitional</b> <b>arrangement</b> often utilize full-time, paid childcare because the work of both parents demands long hours, even if the wife works only part-time.|$|E

The repeated cycle of deflationary hard money, followed by inflationary paper money continued {{through much of the}} 18th and 19th centuries. Often nations would have dual currencies, with paper trading at some discount to specie backed money.|$|E
