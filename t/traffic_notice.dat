40|$|We {{analyze the}} arrival rate of accesses to Web proxy caching servers. The {{results show that}} the data display strong {{periodic}} autocorrelation. The examined data sets show a consistent behavior in terms of having periods corresponding to daily and weekly cycles that can be explained in terms of daily and weekly cyclic behavior of Web users. While these results confirm the correlation in the network <b>traffic</b> <b>noticed</b> by other researchers, we emphasize that this correlation also is periodic. A new approach is introduced to model data that exhibit such characteristics by a combination of Fourier and statistical analysis techniques. The source of high correlation in the data is shown to come from the periodic (deterministic) part. Synthesized data that results from this modeling approach is shown to have a long-range dependent and self-similar behavior...|$|R

40|$|Overview. This is {{a vision}} of {{cooperating}} vehicles that help keep roads free of traffic congestion. This vision explores the concept of dynamic time-space corridor that can be negotiated between cooperating vehicles to guarantee congestion-free journeys from departure to arrival. This {{vision of the future}} is motivated by the increasing traffic congestion around our densely populated metropolitan areas. There is no need here to reference the numerous studies on traffic safety and pollution carried out by governmental agencies over the years or to bring forward accident, carbon dioxide, and driver-stress figures. Everyone that has been in a large city in rush hour has most likely experienced how stressful it is to be locked in <b>traffic,</b> <b>noticed</b> the pollution in the air, considered how they could have been injured on the road, and wondered how much better their lives would be without traffic congestion.

50|$|Another {{replacement}} {{bridge was}} built and entered service in 1897, lasting until 1969, {{when it was}} demolished. In the meantime, ferries were used to transport people and goods. This second bridge was designed by Alfred Barton Brady. It was constructed of steel and had two carriage ways and two footpaths. As early as 1943 evidence of the bridge buckling from the weight of increased <b>traffic</b> was <b>noticed.</b> Tram numbers on the bridge had to be restricted and the footpath removed as a result.|$|R

It took two hours for the Department of Fire and Emergency Services to contain the blaze. The owners were overseas and the fire was not suspicious. Arson investigators from the Western Australia Police found it was a [...] "non-determinate fire".

25|$|Fornebu Air <b>Traffic</b> Control <b>noticed</b> {{that the}} {{aircraft}} disappeared from their radar and notified Asker and Bærum Police District at 16:36 {{that there was}} a potential crash. Fornebu contacted Drammen Police District at 16:57 and asked for a search in the area around the farm at Solli. The air traffic control estimated the area in which they believed the aircraft must have been in. Despite that their estimate for the crash site was accurate, they gave the police an incorrect sector to search in. Asker and Bærum Police District dispatched two patrols at 17:00, one from Asker to Solli and from Sandvika to Nikebatteriet. The patrol from Asker passed almost right by the crash site, stopped to investigate, but found no indications of the wreckage. At 17:13 the police requested that crew be allocated to Nikebatteriet to conduct a search and rescue operation. The overall coordination is carried out by the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway (JRCC SN).|$|R
50|$|Drift dives can be {{done from}} the shore, but this {{requires}} some form of transport {{to pick up the}} divers where they come ashore, which is usually not accurately predictable, so it is more commonly done from a boat, which will follow the group and pick up divers as they surface. It may be possible to follow the divers by watching the bubbles, but a more reliable method is for the dive leader to tow a surface marker buoy, and for all the divers of the group to follow the leader. If a diver or buddy pair finds it necessary to surface before the leader they will ascend up the float line if possible, as this will surface them where the boat crew expects and is watching. Divers that are separated from the group are generally advised to deploy a decompression buoy and ascend on the their own line, as the buoy will alert the surface crew to a separate group, and will also help other boat <b>traffic</b> to <b>notice</b> and avoid running the divers down as they reach the surface.|$|R
50|$|On January 15, 1997, at 6:30am local time, {{simultaneous}} opposite-direction {{parallel runway}} operations were in use at Kingsford Smith International Airport in Sydney, Australia. An Airbus Industries A320-211 departed on runway 16L while an international Boeing 747 {{to the south}} was approaching runway 34L {{and because of this}} the Airbus A320 was required to turn left directly after takeoff to 115 degrees. However, the crew mistakenly dialed 155 degrees into the autopilot. After take off the crew realized they had set the incorrect heading and were maintaining 155 degrees. Air <b>traffic</b> control <b>noticed</b> the aircraft had not turned left but was unable to instruct them as the crew had transferred to the departure radio frequency where they were then instructed to turn to heading 115. The Pilot in Command of the Airbus A320 claimed to have the Boeing 747 in sight, however the crew of the 747 did not sight the Airbus A320. Neither aircraft breached distance separation standards for the SODPROPS approach, however an occurrence investigation was opened by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.|$|R

25|$|With {{a declining}} {{military}} role for railways both in Britain {{and the rest}} of the world, it was inevitable that the significance of the facilities offered by the LMR would be reduced in later years. Even so, the LMR was still important enough for the tracks of the Bentley to Bordon branch to be left in place when passenger services were withdrawn on 16 September 1957. This line remained in place as, although there was a British Railways connection at Liss, the Bordon branch made it easier to accommodate the movements of military <b>traffic</b> at short <b>notice.</b> In 1966, the movement of goods over the Bordon branch was suspended, and the line was taken up in 1967.|$|R

The assistant controller could only see the lights from the towing vehicle. At this point, the towing car driver stated that he saw Flight 7703 was lining up for takeoff then asked to the Halim Tower whether Flight 7703 was initiating the takeoff, but there was no reply from the Halim Tower. Fearing that Flight 7703 would take off, the towing car driver then speeds up the towing and turned to {{the right side of the}} runway.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} {{extensively}} renovated {{in the winter}} of 1993/1994. A new peaked roof was constructed over the gentlemen's toilets, and the old wooden canopy removed and window apertures converted into archways. At this time the station master's office was halved in size to create a booking hall and a new internal ticket hatch installed, the original being blocked off the waiting room was also reopened, having been closed for over 30 years. The overhauled station was reopened with suitable ceremony later that year by local politician Phil Kermode who at the time was the minister with responsibility for the railway. During the winter of 2012 the partition in the booking hall was removed, recreating the full sized office, and the fireplace reinstated; the original ticket hatch was also brought back into use. In the summer months the station building is adorned with flower baskets and period features such as milk churns (a nod to the station's former importance for handling goods and freight <b>traffic),</b> reproduction <b>notice</b> boards and enamelled signage reinstated on the exterior walls based upon period photographs. This work was carried out by the Friends Of... group.|$|R

50|$|Sky Shield III, held on September 2, 1962 from 1:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., was North America's {{first test}} of {{procedures}} for clearing national civilian air <b>traffic</b> at short <b>notice,</b> such {{as would be}} done {{in the event of a}} Soviet attack. Hundreds of USAF trainers were used to simulate normal civil traffic levels and routes. The Air Force trainers launched 319 Lockheed T-33 light jets, 263 in the U.S. and 56 in Canada, from random and unannounced locations. As the alert horn sounded, Federal Aviation Administration controllers hustled to get them to civil airports far from the metropolitan targets that were presumed to be under mushroom clouds.

50|$|At 14:37 the An-10 {{departed}} from Simferopol Airport and proceeded {{on the route}} {{at an altitude of}} 6000 meters. At 15:06 the flight was passed over to Sochi air traffic control. At 15:29 the crew of the An-10 contacted air traffic control and were instructed to proceed on a bearing of 240° and given information regarding the weather; mild winds at 3-4 m/s were present. The controller failed to inform the flight crew about the cloudcover at approximately 600 meters on the mountains nearby. Shortly thereafter the aircraft was given permission to decrease altitude to 500 meters. At 15:37 the crew reported they were at the new assigned altitude and still on a bearing of 240°; to which the controller responded with by ordering the flight to change course to a bearing of 60°; after which the air traffic controller was replaced when shifts were changed.When the air <b>traffic</b> controller <b>noticed</b> the aircraft approaching the mountains, he ordered the flight to change course to the left by 20°, when in fact it would have taken a minimum of 60° to avoid the mountains.

50|$|Safely {{riding a}} moped mostly {{requires}} the same considerations as safely riding a motorcycle but the lower speeds, while reducing some dangers, increases others. The biggest {{danger is that}} other <b>traffic</b> may not <b>notice</b> {{the presence of a}} moped - bright clothes and reflective fittings help. Drivers may even see the moped, recognize it as harmless to them and simply forget it's there, pulling out of side-turnings into its path. Similarly, a car approaching a moped from behind will approach it more quickly than the driver expects, and the driver's attention may be more attuned to other automobile traffic rather than the moped, increasing the likelihood of an accident. This is a particular problem for mopeds used on high-speed roads where they may not be intended to travel.|$|R
5000|$|Auditory {{adaptation}}, as perceptual adaptation {{with other}} senses, {{is the process}} by which individuals adapt to sounds and noises. As research has shown, as time progresses, individuals tend to adapt to sounds and tend to distinguish them less frequently after a while. Sensory adaptation tends to blend sounds into one, variable sound, rather than having several separate sounds as a series. Moreover, after repeated perception, individuals tend to adapt to sounds {{to the point where they}} no longer consciously perceive it, or rather, [...] "block it out". An individual that lives close to the train tracks, will eventually stop noticing the sounds of passing trains. Similarly, individuals living in larger cities no longer <b>notice</b> <b>traffic</b> sounds after a while.

30|$|Different {{challenges}} {{have been}} identified in future wireless communications. An important envisaged requirement is to provide great service in a crowded network [3] in a more energy-efficient way. Some examples of possible scenarios are meeting rooms at certain hours in business buildings, shopping, stadiums, open air festivals, public events, <b>traffic</b> jams, etc. <b>Notice</b> that the occurrence of these scenarios is non-predictable by the operator. The optimal solution, from the infrastructure point of view, could be to adapt the coverage of these unpredictable crowded areas, in terms of time and localization, as they are at the origin of dense traffic. The idea is to have an elastic network infrastructure. An example of this, is the Google Loon project [4], where balloons equipped with antenna systems placed at the stratosphere at around 20 km {{from the surface of the}} earth and steered using the different wind current layers are used to provide coverage.|$|R

The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|R
