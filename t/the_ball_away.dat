5|$|With {{little time}} {{remaining}} before halftime, Virginia Tech used a hurry-up offense. Randall completed a 23-yard pass to Eddie Royal {{and ran for}} 22yards on his own, but threw three consecutive incomplete passes to end the drive. Tech was forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away,</b> and the first half came to an end. At halftime, Auburn led, 9–0.|$|E
5|$|After the punt, the Pirates {{were unable}} to obtain a first down. Three plays netted only twoyards, and ECU was forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away.</b> On the ensuing drive, Boise State {{completed}} three first downs on the series. BSU kicker Kyle Brotzman, converted a 31yard field goal and the Broncos shrank the ECU lead further. The series went 40yards in nine plays. It took the team two minutes and 37seconds to score.|$|E

5|$|Boise State {{committed}} four turnovers, {{compared with}} East Carolina's one. The Broncos fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> twice and threw two interceptions. Despite {{the disparity in}} turnover margin, the teams were strikingly similar in several statistical categories, indicating {{the closeness of the}} game: Each team earned seven points off the turnovers. Both teams committed 50yards in penalties; the Pirates had seven penalties to the Broncos' four. In addition, both teams earned 22 firstdowns.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{took the}} kickoff on the 39–yard line, after a Boise player {{illegally}} touched {{the ball on}} the 39. Pinkney threw an incomplete pass to start the drive, and after two more plays failed to convert the first down, ECU was forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away.</b> After a touchback, Boise State began at its 20–yard line. The Broncos completed three plays for 11yards before the third quarter ended.|$|E
5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain a first down. The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, they too had difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up a first down off of a penalty on Wake Forest, they were unable to gain a first down by their own devices and were forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU {{a chance for a}} first down. Boise was forced to kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. ECU needed just four plays to march 74yards down the field for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard pass for a touchdown. After the touchdown and the extra point kick, ECU led 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} plays {{of the fourth}} quarter {{failed to live up}} to the promise that had been shown in the third for the Hokies. Two {{incomplete}} passes and one that gained just twoyards forced Virginia Tech to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> with 13:49 remaining in the quarter. After taking over at its 33-yard line, Kansas had no more success on offense than did Virginia Tech. After three straight plays with no gain, Kansas was forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> as well. A 58-yard kick by Kyle Tucker pinned Virginia Tech inside its 10-yard line, and the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much beyond the ten-yard line. An incomplete pass and a two-yard run by Branden Ore were all the offense managed before Sean Glennon threw a 20-yard interception to the Jayhawks' Justin Thornton. Thornton returned the ball 30yards to the Virginia Tech two-yard line, and on Kansas' first play after the interception, Todd Reesing ran twoyards for the touchdown. The score gave the Jayhawks a 2414 lead with just 10:57 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} a one-yard run later, Tech prepared to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away.</b> During the kick, Florida State's defense {{broke through the}} Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the kick. The ball rolled inside the one-yard line, where Florida State's offense took over. On the first play after the block, Rix leaped across the goal line for the game's first touchdown. The extra point attempt was a success, and with 6:32 remaining in the first half, Florida State took a 73 lead.|$|E

5|$|After Kent State {{turned the}} ball over on downs, Northern Illinois, {{for the first time}} in the second half, did not score and punted <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away.</b> Kent State began a {{comeback}} on their ensuing drive via a 5-yard touchdown drive Spencer Keith, making the score 27-20. Northern Illinois' next drive lasted only one play, a fumble by Jordan Lynch that was returned by Kent State defender Zack Hitchens for a touchdown. After Cortez made the extra point, the game was tied at 27. The Huskies got back on track by scoring a touchdown, a 9-yard run by Lynch, but the Golden Flashes responded with one of their own, a 19-yard pass from Keith to Tim Erjavec. At the end of regulation, the score was tied at 34.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> with 2:13 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Because Florida State had {{received}} the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's return was the first touchdown {{of the game and}} the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history. With 13:46 remaining in the third quarter, Florida State had taken a 103 lead.|$|E

50|$|Typically {{two players}} {{primarily}} cover the wide receivers. Cornerbacks attempt to prevent successful quarterback passes by either swatting <b>the</b> airborne <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> from <b>the</b> receiver or by catching the pass themselves.

5|$|Because NC State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State's kickoff and returned it to the 10-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working down the field, running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly. Once on the NC State side of the field, Tech picked up another first down, but Tech's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away.</b> The ball landed at the NC State 12-yard line where the Wolfpack began a drive.|$|E
5|$|Coach Friedgen named Smith {{the special}} teams captain for the Virginia game. During the game, Virginia chose to kick short to keep <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> from Smith on kickoffs, and quarterback Chris Turner did not target him until the fourth quarter. He {{finished}} with three receptions for 34yards and no returns. He recorded two receptions for 13yards at Duke. At NC State, he caught eight passes for 64yards and returned a kickoff 84yards for a touchdown. During the game, he surpassed the ACC single-season kickoff return yards record {{which he had}} set the previous season. He had four receptions for 55yards against 21st-ranked Virginia Tech, seven receptions for 71yards against Florida State, and six receptions for 68yards and a touchdown against Boston College.|$|E
5|$|Due to the missed field goal, Air Force {{took over}} from {{the point at which}} the kick was missed, the 27-yard line. Despite gaining a bit of {{momentum}} when they kept Virginia Tech from scoring, the Falcons were unable to gain a first down and went three and out, punting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away.</b> Tech declined to return the ball, which rolled to the Virginia Tech three-yard line, where the Hokies' offense took over. On the first play after the punt, Tech's Nigel Bowe fumbled the ball, which was leapt upon by several Air Force defenders, who recovered it. After the fumble recovery, it took the Falcons just one play to score a touchdown and gain a 107 lead.|$|E
50|$|In the game, a {{layer of}} bricks lines the top third of <b>the</b> screen. A <b>ball</b> travels across <b>the</b> screen, {{bouncing}} off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> bounces <b>away</b> and <b>the</b> brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> touches <b>the</b> bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> upward, keeping it in play.|$|R

25|$|Outswinger: An outswinger to a {{right-handed}} batsman can be bowled by aligning {{the seam}} {{slightly to the}} left towards the slips and placing the roughened side of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on <b>the</b> left.

5|$|Following Martyn Woolford's {{departure}} from York, Brodie {{played on the}} left wing in the 1–0 away victory over Crawley Town on {{the opening day of}} the season. His first goal of the season came after being assisted by Simon Rusk in a 2–2 away draw with Northwich Victoria. After coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute, he was sent off in the 76th minute of a 3–1 away defeat against Wrexham on 7 October 2008, after initially being shown a yellow card for kicking <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> and then receiving a second card for a tackle on Carl Tremarco, which resulted in him being suspended for York's match against Woking.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down at its 25-yard line. After a rushing play was stopped for a loss and Paci was forced to throw <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away</b> to avoid a sack, Indiana punted {{for the first time}} in {{the second quarter}}. Tech resumed offense at its 41-yard line. DeShazo completed a pass to the Indiana 47-yard line, then a 25-yard toss to Cornelius Wright, who carried it to the Indiana 22. Swarm carried the ball for a first down inside the Indiana 10-yard line, and two plays later, he carried it across the goal line for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech took a 147 lead with 11:14 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Janikowski's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Vick and the Tech offense {{began at}} their 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first play, Davis ran for 16yards and {{a first down}} on an end-around {{similar to the one}} he ran in the first quarter. Despite that success, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down. Appearing to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>away,</b> Tech ran a trick play where the punter {{attempted}} to rush for a first down. He was stopped short of the needed mark, however, and Florida State's offense returned to the field, beginning at the Tech 43-yard line. On the first play after taking over, Weinke completed a 43-yard pass to Warrick for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 4629 lead with 7:42 remaining in the game.|$|E
50|$|As {{the clock}} ticked past the 70 minute mark Juric nearly had a brace, {{he picked up}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> after Digao over-ran it, and Juric went on a mazy run at the defence. Juric opened up enough space for a placed shot {{from the edge of}} the penalty area, which beat the keeper but not <b>the</b> woodwork, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{bouncing}} <b>away</b> from <b>the</b> path of Mark Bridge who would have been faced with a tap-in.|$|R
