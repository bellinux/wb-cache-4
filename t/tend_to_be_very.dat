They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, {{although it has been}} noted that they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger organic compounds that <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} {{is the value of}} protection: would the plant be less able to survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{upon what}} {{substances}} are reacting, the reaction rate varies. Acid/base reactions, {{the formation of}} salts, and ion exchange are fast reactions. When covalent bond formation takes place between the molecules and when large molecules are formed, the reactions <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> slow.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} type, where {{tracks and}} trains {{run along the}} streets and share space with road traffic. Stops <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> frequent, but little effort is made to set up special stations. Because space is shared, the tracks are usually visually unobtrusive.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} topology of a surface {{will determine the}} viable environment for bacteria. It may affect the ability for a microbe to adhere to its surface. Textile surfaces, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> easy for microbes to adhere due to the abundance of interstitial spacing between fibers.|$|E
25|$|Closed-back {{headphones}} {{are highly}} recommended for DJs to block outside noise as {{the environment of}} DJ usually <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires ¼ inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and ¼ inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.|$|E
25|$|Surveys of bra sizes <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> {{dependent}} on the population studied {{and how it was}} obtained. For instance, one U.S. study reported that the most common size was 34B, followed by 34C, that 63% were size 34 and 39% cup size B. However, the survey sample was drawn from 103 Caucasian student volunteers at a Midwest U.S. university aged 18–25, and excluded pregnant and nursing women.|$|E

25|$|Compared with placental mammals or plesiosaurs, {{ichthyosaur}} fetuses <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> {{small and}} their number per litter is often high. In one female of Stenopterygius seven have been identified, in another eleven. The fetuses have {{at most a}} quarter of the length of the mother animal. The juveniles have about the same body proportions as adult individuals. The main ontogenetical changes during growth consist in the fusion and greater robustness of the skeletal elements.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{from the}} Central Valley of La Morra and Barolo <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> perfumed and velvety with less tannins than other Barolos. The {{soil of the}} Central Valley itself is more clay based with {{increased}} levels of magnesium oxide and manganese. The wines from the Serralunga Valley are more full bodied and tannic and require aging of 12–15 years before they hit their peak. The soil of the Serralunga is heavy in sand, iron, limestone, phosphorus and potassium.|$|E
25|$|Adult moths of this {{subfamily}} do not feed. They {{usually have}} muted colours (browns and greys), although some are white, and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hairy. Some females are flightless, {{and some have}} reduced wings. Usually, the females have a large tuft {{at the end of}} the abdomen. The males, at least, have tympanal organs. They are mostly nocturnal, but Schaefer lists 20 confirmed diurnal species and 20 more likely diurnal species (based on reduced eye size).|$|E

25|$|Biochemical processes, {{of which}} {{photosynthesis}} is one, tend to preferentially incorporate the lighter 12C isotope. Thus ocean-dwelling photosynthesizers, both protists and algae, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> slightly depleted in 13C, {{relative to the}} abundance found in the primary volcanic sources of Earth's carbon. Therefore, an ocean with photosynthetic life will have a lower 13C/12C ratio within organic remains, and a higher ratio in corresponding ocean water. The organic component of the lithified sediments will forever remain very slightly, but measurably, depleted in 13C.|$|E
25|$|Native American {{languages}} are widely spoken in Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay and Mexico, {{and to a}} lesser degree, in Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, and Chile amongst other countries. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> small or even non-existent (e.g. Uruguay). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains a wider variety of indigenous languages than any Latin American country, but the most spoken language is Nahuatl.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} secrecy and inconspicuousness deeply colors the traditions and mannerisms of mafiosi. Mafiosi are {{discouraged}} from consuming alcohol or other drugs, as in an inebriated state {{they are more}} likely to blurt out sensitive information. They also frequently adopt self-effacing attitudes to strangers so as to avoid unwanted attention. Most Sicilians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> verbose and expressive, whereas mafiosi tend to be more terse and subdued. Mafiosi are also forbidden from writing down anything about their activities, lest such evidence be discovered by police.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery County, {{north of}} Houston, is a Republican stronghold, {{supported}} by voters in affluent communities on Lake Conroe and in The Woodlands. Rural {{residents of the}} county, though primarily lower- and middle-class, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> socially conservative and also have a substantial Republican following. However, the city of Conroe proper, the county seat, tends to lean Democratic. Although The Woodlands is home to many corporate transplants from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, {{who tend to be}} of a more liberal persuasion, most of these people are not U.S. citizens, thus have little impact on the voting trends of the county.|$|E
50|$|The Legion <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> top-heavy, in {{that there}} was a disproportionate number of {{high-ranking}} officers to regular soldiers. Supposedly, this <b>was</b> <b>to</b> elevate the social status and official standing of some members of the city.|$|R
