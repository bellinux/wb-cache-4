5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, {{but because of the}} nature of the symptoms experienced, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age {{began in}} Scotland about 2000 BCE as new {{techniques}} of metalworking began to reach northern Britain. The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a fall in population in this period. There {{is evidence of}} cellular round houses of stone on Shetland and wooden crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands. As elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced in this period.|$|E
5|$|What {{were thought}} to be {{fragments}} of Roman pottery tiles were found in Hale Barns in the 1880s near the site of what is now St Ambrose College.

5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4, 1942. His stay <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> short, for {{his wife}} {{recorded}} that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed. Tatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife, now pregnant with their second child, {{where he would be}} assigned, but she noticed that he studied maps of the North Pacific area. At one point, he remarked to Taeko {{that he was going to}} an area where he might meet some of his former classmates from California.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received more rain and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> less need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean shaft graves are {{essentially}} an Argive {{variant of the}} rudimentary Middle Helladic funerary tradition with features derived from Early Bronze Age traditions developed locally in mainland Greece. Grave Circle A, formed circa 1600 BC as a new elite burial place, was probably first restricted to men {{and seems to be}} a continuation of the earlier Grave Circle B and correlates with the general social trend of higher burial investment taking place throughout entire Greece that time. The Grave Circle A site {{was part of a larger}} funeral place from the Middle Helladic period. At the time it was built, during the Late Helladic I (1600 BC), <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a small unfortified palace on Mycenae, while the graves of the Mycenaean ruling family remained outside of the city walls. There is no evidence of a circular wall around the site during the period of the burials. The last interment took place circa 1500 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{significance of}} the Device Forts declined during the 18th century. Some of the fortifications were redesigned to provide more comfortable housing for their occupants. Cowes Castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation, demolishing much of the keep and adding residential wings and gardens over the landward defences, and Brownsea Castle began to be converted into a country house from the 1720s onwards. Walmer became the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, carried out extensive work there after 1708. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> some rivalry {{in the relationship between}} Sackville and the naval officer Sir John Norris, who redeveloped nearby Deal Castle during the same period, creating comfortable wood-panelled quarters for himself there overlooking the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{renewable}} energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, {{according to a}} 2013 study by Scottish Renewables. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support for {{renewable energy}}. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands. Rural job creation is being supported by bioenergy systems in areas such as Lochaber, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway.|$|E

5|$|The size {{difference}} between sexes {{has led to}} the suggestion that the Rodrigues solitaire was not monogamous as stated by Leguat, and that this deeply religious man attributed the trait to the bird for moral reasons. It has been proposed that it was instead polygynous, and the wing-rattling behaviour described for males suggests lek-mating, where males gather for competitive mating display. However, size dimorphism does occur in some monogamous birds; most other pigeons are monogamous as well. A 2015 article proposed that males invited females into their territories as secondary mates, which would result in the resident female acting aggressively towards the newcomer. Similar behaviour is seen in species that practice resource-defence polygyny. The territories probably provided all the food the birds needed in adittion to acting as breeding-areas, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> intense competition for favourable territories. The fact that Rodrigues island shrank by 90% {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene may also have contributed to such competition over territories, and thereby furthered sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{documentary}} {{evidence about the}} nature of trade in Eadbald's reign. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade in the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence that suggests that the royal influence predates any of the written sources, and it may have been Eadbald's father, Æthelberht, who took control of trade away from the aristocracy and made it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods, which was an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself. Kent traded locally made glass and jewelry to the Franks; Kentish goods have been found as far south as the mouth of the Loire, south of Brittany. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> also a flourishing slave trade. The wealth this commerce brought to Kent may have been the basis of the continuing, though diminished, importance of Kent in Eadbald's reign.|$|E
5|$|Before the Battle of Niså, Harald {{had been}} joined by Haakon Ivarsson, who {{distinguished}} himself in the battle and gained Harald's favour. Reportedly even considering {{to give him the}} title of Earl, Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise. With a strong hold over the Uplands, Haakon was additionally given the earldom of Värmland by the Swedish king Stenkil. In early 1064, Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes, the region thus effectively threatening to renounce their loyalty to Harald. The revolt of Haakon and the farmers in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson. After the agreement, Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands, only to find that the farmers would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived. In response, Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon. Still facing opposition from the farmers, Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes. Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country, the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king's realm. Using harsh measures, Harald burned down farms and small villages, and had people maimed and killed. Starting in Romerike, his campaign continued into Hedmark, Hadeland and Ringerike. Since the regions contained several rich rural communities, Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates. By the end of 1065 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> peace in Norway, as any opposition had either been killed, chased into exile or silenced.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of a class-action lawsuit and {{community}} settlement with DuPont, three epidemiologists conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population. The studies concluded that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an association between PFOA exposure and six health outcomes: kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), and pregnancy-induced hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Such {{settlements}} probably housed populations numbering in the thousands. For this reason, {{combined with}} their centralising economic role, Celtic oppida are sometime described as proto-urban. Nonetheless, {{little is known}} about settlement and other activity on the interior of the site. Evidence from the sites at Manching or Oberursel-Oberstedten suggests that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a village or town-like settlement with houses, workshops and storage areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a harbour or landing place at Whitehaven {{can be traced back}} to the early 16th century when quay-dues – otherwise known as wharfage – were recorded in 1517. Also in 1677 an historical description of Whitehaven refers to “a little pier, in shallow water, built with some wooden piles and stones”. So, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a man-made harbour structure at Whitehaven before the Lowthers started to develop the area.|$|E

25|$|As an Aztec city, it {{contained}} a sacred plaza with a temple {{and perhaps a}} lord's palace. Outside this plaza area was the residential area for the elite called the pipiltin, consisting of large houses occupied by extended families. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> also a central market. Outside of that was a second residential zone for the common population, called the macehualtin. The organization of the city reflected that of Texcoco but at a smaller scale. There is evidence that this city produced crafts such as ceramics on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|Since the halakhic Midrashim had {{for their}} {{secondary}} purpose the exegesis of the Bible, they were arranged {{according to the}} text of the Pentateuch. As Genesis contains very little matter of a legal character, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> no halakhic midrash to this book. On the other hand, to each of the other four books of the Pentateuch there was a midrash from the school of R. Akiba and one from the school of R. Ishmael, and these midrashim are still in great part extant. The halakhic midrash to Exodus from the school of R. Ishmael is the Mekilta, while that of the school of R. Akiba is the Mekilta of R. Shimon bar Yochai, most of which is contained in the Midrash ha-Gadol.|$|E
25|$|Senior {{officials}} {{chose the}} Mwene Kongo or king who served for life following their choice. Electors varied over time, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> never a completely fixed list; rather, senior officials who exercised power did so.

The ruler of Vunda, whose lands lay near Mbanza Kongo, was also often named as an elector and certainly {{played a role in}} the coronation ceremonies. The ruler of Soyo also cast a vote in the election. Many kings tried to choose their successor, not always successfully. One of the central problems of Kongo history was the succession of power, and as a result the country was disturbed by many rebellions and revolts.|$|E
