500|$|Leigh was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, [...] "People <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2004, Biden {{secured the}} brief release of Libyan {{democracy}} activist and political prisoner Fathi Eljahmi, {{after meeting with}} leader Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli. [...] In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President George W. Bush for his speech to Israel's Knesset in which he suggested that some Democrats were acting {{in the same way}} some Western leaders did when they appeased Hitler in the runup to World War II. Biden stated: [...] "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous. Outrageous {{for the president of the}} United States to go to a foreign country, sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement." [...] Biden later apologized for using the expletive. Biden further stated, [...] "Since when does this administration <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> sit down, you have to eliminate the word 'no' from your vocabulary?" ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E

She <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> see Mrs. Darrell {{mingling}} with the home circle, you'll see flaws in her which you don't see when you don't see her mingling with the home circle, don't you see? Do you see now?" ...|$|R

2500|$|At the United Nations Stevenson {{worked hard}} to support U.S. foreign policy, even when he {{personally}} disagreed with some of President Kennedy's actions. However, he was often seen as an outsider in the Kennedy administration, with one historian noting [...] "everyone knew that Stevenson's position {{was that of a}} bit player." [...] Kennedy told his adviser Walt Rostow that [...] "Stevenson wouldn't be happy as president. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> talk long enough you get a soft option and there are very few soft options as president." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{are very}} happy with this class. It is a large {{recruiting}} class. I feel that it {{met a lot of}} our needs. We lost a lot of [...] We were able to fill those needs with this class of players. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to describe this recruiting class, they are a big, athletic bunch of athletes who can run and hit. They are also good students. I am really putting an emphasis on guys who can be successful in life, and who have goals that they want to achieve... We have 15 local-area players. There are some others that we would have liked to have, but you are never going to get all of them. We put a lot of stock in trying to recruit the local-area kids." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was waiting, sir; I was waiting--but----" [...] and she paused, [...] "that {{secret is}} not my own; but I <b>think,</b> sir, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will go to Mr. Armstrong, {{he will be able}} to tell you {{something}} you will be glad to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is possible--indeed the General {{thinks it}} is probable--that Fadil, if unable to cross, may return with his army to Gedareh. It is to warn you of this {{possibility}} that he sent me here. Gedareh {{is reported to be}} a defensible position, and therefore he <b>thinks</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> capture it, it would be advisable to maintain yourself there until reinforcements can be sent to you, either from the Blue Nile or the Atbara. The place, it seems, is well supplied with provisions and stores; and in the event of Fadil opposing you, it would be far safer for you to defend it than to be attacked in the open, or during a retreat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you were}} really fool enough to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{captured}} me single-handed I should walk with you like a lamb to the gallows?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'If {{you were}} settled here, I should feel more comfortable. I {{sometimes}} <b>think,</b> John, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would fix yourself I {{would give the}} property up to you altogether and go away with my books into some town. Cambridge, perhaps, would {{do as well as}} any other.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> necessary, Pierre, <b>you</b> {{could carry}} a message into the town, {{even though the}} Catholics were camped round it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think,</b> Ettie, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were {{to leave}} us alone we could get this thing settled," [...] said McMurdo quietly. [...] "Or maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will take a turn {{down the street with}} me. It's a fine evening, and there's some open ground beyond the next block." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Inspector," [...] Sabatini said, [...] "I am Count Sabatini, a nobleman of {{the country}} from which that man comes.

60|$|Bertie’s reply {{took the}} form of hastily {{collecting}} material for an impromptu banquet from the larder and locking himself into his bedroom. His mother made frequent visits to the locked door and shouted a succession of interrogations with the persistence of one who <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ask a question often enough an answer will eventually result. Bertie did nothing to encourage the supposition. An hour had passed in fruitless one-sided palaver when another letter addressed to Bertie and marked “private” made its appearance in the letter-box. Mrs. Heasant pounced on it with the enthusiasm of a cat that has missed its mouse and to whom a second has been unexpectedly vouchsafed. If she hoped for further disclosures assuredly she was not disappointed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' said Anne diffidently, {{seeing that}} her cousin {{was in a}} graver mood this evening, 'do not <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{could be a little}} more companionable to Kate, and not say things so evidently for the sake of contradiction, you might gain a little useful influence?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That we {{may hear}} oracles, Master. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{choose to go}} the lady Quilla would come with us, since perhaps she would like also to hear oracles." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stacy smiled grimly. [...] "I <b>think,</b> Barker boy, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{go to the}} Branch you'll have no {{difficulty}} in paying for the Ditch property. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My little lord," [...] said he, [...] "dost thou <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I carry <b>thee,</b> thou wilt be {{able and}} {{strong enough to}} cling to my neck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{in other}} respects she {{is not up to}} my standard,' {{continued}} Bernard. 'So I <b>think,</b> Rosa, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should ever take up such a scheme again we should act together. I am sure my opinion would be of great advantage to you in helping you to select some one who should take up the work of making me happy--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] I said, much amused, [...] "you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were mixed}} up in a crime, say a murder, you'd be able to spot the murderer right off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, De la Noue, I do not <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> or I {{had been}} in command here, {{we could have done}} better than these two young fellows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get {{the police}} here at once, Jonas, we shall find both the thief and the loot under our very roof," [...] she replied, not without asperity.|$|E
6000|$|... "We waste words," [...] she {{continued}} coldly. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I leave <b>you</b> with {{the contents of}} your safe, it will be wise for you to hand me that document." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think,</b> Mrs. Renwick, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{leave your}} trap {{and go up}} to the top of that knoll, two hundred yards to the right, you will get a really good view of the plain." ...|$|R
60|$|I didn't {{tell him}} that I came there every night, and that I came because I was paid for it. If you're a {{professional}} dancer at Geisenheimer's, you aren't supposed to advertise the fact. The management <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did it might send the public away thinking too hard when they saw you win the Great Contest for the Love-r-ly Silver Cup which they offer later in the evening. Say, that Love-r-ly Cup's a joke. I win it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Mabel Francis wins it on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. It's all perfectly fair and square, of course. It's purely a matter of merit who wins the Love-r-ly Cup. Anybody could win it. Only somehow they don't. And the coincidence {{of the fact that}} Mabel and I always do has kind of got on the management's nerves, and they don't like us to tell people we're employed there. They prefer us to blush unseen.|$|R
