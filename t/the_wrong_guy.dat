25|$|Wolf {{took the}} idea to then-president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage, who pointed out the {{similarity}} to a 1963 series titled Arrest and Trial, which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer (Ben Gazzara) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by Chuck Connors gets the perpetrator off as <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>guy</b> in the second half; this was the formula of the show every week. Wolf decided that, while his detectives would occasionally also be fallible, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre, to go from police procedural to prosecution with {{a greater degree of}} realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.|$|E
