[...] "All three of those records are <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favourite things I've ever heard", he said.

My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing.|$|E
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|Following Hollywood's {{reported}} {{disappointment in}} {{the lack of}} sales longevity of the Hilary Duff album and the chart performance of [...] "Fly", all further single releases from Hilary Duff in the United States were cancelled and the Most Wanted project was quickly conceived. On May 20, 2005, MTV News reported that Duff would be releasing a new album in August, comprising previously released tracks and four new recordings. It was also announced that preceding the album's release, Duff would begin a 32-date summer concert tour {{in support of the}} album. Four days later, on May 24, the album's title was revealed to be Most Wanted, and the album's release date was announced to be August 16, 2005.

According to Duff, she did not tell anyone at her record label that she was working with the Dead Executives. Joel, whom Duff had been dating at the time, was aware that she needed new material for a compilation album, and knew that she wanted a [...] "totally different sound". Together, the Dead Executives went into the recording studio and worked on new music for Duff, before bringing her into the studio to collectively work on them.|$|E
