5|$|The {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> lay in an amateur group of high-placed courtiers who {{performed}} {{for each other}} {{within the context of}} the Duke's informal musica secreta in the 1570s. <b>The</b> <b>ensemble</b> evolved into an all-female group of professional musicians, the concerto delle donne, who performed formal concerts for members of the inner circle of the court and important visitors. Their signature style of florid, highly ornamented singing brought prestige to Ferrara and inspired composers of the time.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. <b>The</b> <b>ensemble</b> will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, {{composed}} by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E

5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the atmosphere {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the atmosphere.

5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> would be entangled in this sense.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>the</b> {{calculation}} of <b>ensembles</b> rely on lower resolution techniques, the Protein Data Bank is not accepting these models.

The availability of <b>the</b> <b>ensembles</b> should facilitate <b>the</b> development of validation and evaluation protocols improving the quality and predictive power.|$|R
5|$|Rewrites of {{the script}} {{gradually}} moved away from <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> of comedians and {{began to focus on}} two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project.

5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics praising <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> cast, {{and each}} lead {{being singled out}} for their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, homophobic and misogynistic. A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, was released on November 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The group's eponymous {{album was}} {{recorded}} in March 1996 and released in September 1997, quickly becoming an international success, which prompted <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam and New York in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film for a documentaryalso called Buena Vista Social Clubthat included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana.

50|$|In {{the theory}} of random matrices, <b>the</b> {{circular}} <b>ensembles</b> are measures on spaces of unitary matrices introduced by Freeman Dyson as modifications of <b>the</b> Gaussian matrix <b>ensembles.</b> <b>The</b> three main examples are <b>the</b> circular orthogonal <b>ensemble</b> (COE) on symmetric unitary matrices, <b>the</b> circular unitary <b>ensemble</b> (CUE) on unitary matrices, and <b>the</b> circular symplectic <b>ensemble</b> (CSE) on self dual unitary quaternionic matrices.|$|R
5|$|The latter mode {{actually}} is reserved specifically for solo agung contest. Unlike other Southern Filipino groups {{who participate in}} group contest, the Maguindanao are unique in that they also hold solo agung contest {{to find out who}} in the community is the best papagagung (expert agung player). Tidto is prefect for such contest since the agung is often the focus of attention, the focal point during <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> during this mode. Players normally perform two or more versions playing the three types of techniques discussed above.|$|E
5|$|The monastery was {{composed}} of six churches, gavit, narthex, (nakhasrah), and other structures. The main church of Varagavank was called Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God). It dated to the 11th century and was similar in plan to the prominent Saint Hripsime Church in Vagharshapat. The earliest structure was on {{the southern part of}} <b>the</b> <b>ensemble</b> and was known as Surb Sopia (10th century). Queen Khushush left an inscription (dated 981) on its western wall.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for <b>the</b> <b>ensemble,</b> and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or not, she was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase <b>the</b> <b>ensemble,</b> and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} ensemble {{approaches in}} single-layered complex-valued 	neural network (CVNN) to solve real-valued classification problems. Each 	component CVNN of an ensemble uses a recently proposed activation function 	for its complex-valued neurons (CVNs). A gradient-descent based learning 	algorithm {{was used to}} train the component CVNNs. We applied two ensemble 	methods, negative correlation learning and bagging, to create <b>the</b> <b>ensembles.</b> 	Experimental results {{on a number of}} real-world benchmark problems showed a 	substantial performance improvement of <b>the</b> <b>ensembles</b> over <b>the</b> individual 	single-layered CVNN classifiers. Furthermore, the generalization performances 	were nearly equivalent to those obtained by <b>the</b> <b>ensembles</b> of real-valued 	multilayer neural networks...|$|R
