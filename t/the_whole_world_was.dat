25|$|There {{once took}} place a great {{competition}} between the Devas to decide who among them should {{be the head of}} the Gana (the troops of semi-gods at the service of Shiva). The competitors were required to circle the world as fast as possible and return to the Feet of Parvati. The gods took off, each on his or her own vehicle, and even Ganesha participated with enthusiasm in the race; but he was extremely heavy and was riding on a mouse! Naturally, his pace was remarkably slow and this was a great disadvantage. He had not yet made much headway when there appeared before him the sage Narada (son of Brahma), who asked him where he was going. Ganesha was very annoyed and went into a rage because it was considered unlucky to encounter a solitary Brahmin just {{at the beginning of a}} voyage. Notwithstanding the fact that Narada was the greatest of Brahmins, son of Brahma himself, this was still a bad omen. Moreover, it wasn't considered a good sign to be asked where one was heading when one was already on the way to some destination; therefore, Ganesha felt doubly unfortunate. Nonetheless, the great Brahmin succeeded in calming his fury. Ganesha explained to him the motives for his sadness and his terrible desire to win. Narada consoled and exhorted him not to despair; he said that for a child, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> embodied within the mother , so all Ganesha had to do was to circle his Parvati and he would defeat those who had more speed but less understanding.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rebellion}} and its suppression effectively {{marked the end}} of the mamluk household al-Jazzar had raised, {{and the end of the}} mamluks as a military institution during al-Jazzar's rule. According to Philipp, the mamluk rebellion was al-Jazzar's [...] "gravest military and political crisis", with the only exception perhaps being Napoleon's siege of Acre in 1799, although the rebellion [...] "was in many ways more serious since it arose from an internal source." [...] The revolt was perceived by al-Jazzar, himself a virtual product of the mamluk system, as a betrayal of his most senior lieutenants, whose careers and wealth he created through his patronage. The rebellion thus had traumatic effects on al-Jazzar's personality, which according to Philipp, transformed al-Jazzar's [...] "latent fears, suspicions and distrust ... into a sense of paranoia". In the rebellion's aftermath, al-Jazzar launched a massive purge in his realm, executing and exiling people of all societal ranks. The 19th-century chronicler Haydar Ahmad Shihab noted that as a result of the rebellion, al-Jazzar [...] "became like an untamed animal ... he imagined that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> against him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2007 AFC Asian Cup {{was another}} facet of {{sporting}} politics.

Following a previous round win, Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Qassim Moussawi {{said they wanted to}} stop [...] "terrorists, Sunni extremists and criminals from targeting the joy of the people." [...] There was controversy after the Iraqi captain Younis Mahmoud said he [...] "dared not return to his homeland because of the conditions created by the U.S. occupation." [...] President Jalal Talabani said it was disappointing they couldn't celebrate at home with the fans. Yet many hailed the victory as a show of unity. Iraq's Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira signified the importance of the win in saying [...] "This is not just about football...this is more important than that...This has brought great happiness to a whole country. This is not about a team, this is about human beings." [...] Likewise, Saudi coach Hélio dos Anjos chimed in that [...] "Iraq deserved to win today...They were very motivated and we knew <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> supporting this team." [...] Likewise, the American leadership also came out in praise of the Iraqi win. However, Iraqi midfielder Ahmed Manajid said that if he was not playing for his country he would have fought in his native Fallujah against U.S. forces. He was one of several players who criticised then-U.S. president George W. Bush for using the team's success in his campaign speeches.|$|E

2500|$|According to legend, Hanina {{was very}} poor. Indeed, it became proverbial that, while <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> {{provided}} for through Hanina's great merits, he himself sustained life from one Sabbath eve to another on {{a basket of}} carob beans. For some time the outside world had been kept in ignorance of his privations; his wife did all that was possible to maintain an appearance of comfort, and though she had no flour with which to make dough, she would put fuel into the oven every Friday and cause columns of smoke to rise, thus making her neighbors believe that, like them, she was baking the Sabbath meals. In time, however, one woman's suspicion was aroused, and she determined to surprise Hanina's wife and discover the truth. But, according to the legend, a miracle prevented exposure. When the woman appeared at Hanina's house {{and looked into the}} smoking oven it was full of loaves. In spite of the miracle, Hanina's wife induced him to collect from heaven an advance portion of his future lot. Hanina complied with her request, and, in answer to his prayer, a golden table-leg was miraculously sent him. Husband and wife were happy; but that night the wife had a vision of heaven in which she saw the saints feasting at three-legged tables while her husband's table had only two legs. She awoke full of regret at the importunity which had deprived his table of a leg, and insisted that he pray for the withdrawal of the treasure. This he did, and the golden leg disappeared. Of this supposed miracle the Talmud says: [...] "It was greater than the former, since heaven gives, but never takes" [...] (Ta'anit, 24b et seq.).|$|E
2500|$|Act three {{takes place}} in the {{courtyard}} of castle of the Wittenstein. Five years have passed. Hans has deceived Ondine with Bertha, and Ondine has long since vanished. It is the morning of the day of the marriage of Bertha and Hans. But Hans is troubled. He tells Bertha, that she should have married a man full of pride and joy. [...] He complains, [...] "Oh Bertha, how she lied to me, that woman!" [...] Bertha points out that Ondine was no woman, [...] "you married a creature of another world. You must forget her." [...] Hans remembers the day that Ondine left and asks, [...] "But why does she proclaim to the world that she deceived me with Bertram?" [...] In addition to being preoccupied with Ondine, Hans is worried because the servants are starting to speak in poetry and there is a Wittenstein legend that this always happens just before misfortune strikes. Two fishermen arrive. The second fisherman is the Old One. They have caught Ondine. Two judges from the inquisition are summoned and immediately put her on trial. Ondine is brought in draped in the net in which she was caught. [...] She does not deny being an Ondine and proclaims to all who will listen that she deceived Hans with Bertram. The judge asks Hans to clearly state the exact nature of his complaint. Hans says, [...] "My complaint? [...] My complaint is the complaint of all mankind. [...] I claim the right to be left in peace {{in a world that is}} free of intrusions by these creatures. [...] Has there never been an age when they did not afflict us?" [...] The judge answers, [...] "An age? [...] There has never been a moment." [...] But the other judge says, [...] "Yes, there was once a moment.
