5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying {{to come up with}} an explanation, <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> if they had {{stumbled}} across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E

500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It {{was the first time}} we ever heard of that, but they said because we were a band going to be touring around the world in 1992 <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> if we wanted to be spokesband for the ISY. So we said why not?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Monk and the Actor" [...] was co-written by Hy Conrad and Joe Toplyn, and was {{directed}} by Randall Zisk. The concept for the episode first emerged while the staff was working on fourth season episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Astronaut", and <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> if Monk would become famous. The first idea was {{to use the same}} set and actors from [...] "Mr. Monk and the Astronaut" [...] to create an episode in which a made-for-TV film is recorded about that case. It was not done but writers still wanted to create an episode focusing on a TV film, which eventually became [...] "Mr. Monk and the Actor". On its original script, it exceeded the runtime by about six minutes so a scene involving a child mistaking a gun for a toy was cut. It would be the murder weapon, and even though a six-year-old actor was hired for the scene it was not filmed.|$|E
500|$|Having played Adventure (1976) on Oden {{and finding}} its cave {{exploration}} exciting, <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> {{if they would}} be able to create a similar game in Swedish. As they worked on the game, they grew into different roles: Kimmo mostly came up with [...] "wacky ideas", Johansson was a driven visionary who [...] "made things happen", and Kann fixed things and made sure that everything worked. According to Kimmo and Johansson, they cared about the game's content, not just the technical aspects, and made a game that they found fun themselves. They created two reoccurring characters based on themselves, who appear throughout the game: Kimmo, based on the real Kimmo, and the [...] "cottage council chairman" [...] Thorvald, who represents Johansson. As Kann was interested in language, and had specific ideas of how to spell certain words, they used consistently correct grammar, while consistently using non-standard spelling for words such as [...] "sig" [...] ("oneself") and [...] "dem" [...] ("them"), rendering them as [...] "sej" [...] and [...] "dom".|$|E
500|$|Recorded in Monument's Nashville {{studios in}} early 1963, [...] "In Dreams" [...] peaked at number 7 on Billboard Hot 100 and spent 13 {{weeks on the}} charts in the U.S. During the five months the song was on the charts, Orbison {{replaced}} guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} England. He was immensely popular in England, and shared billing with the Beatles, of whom he had never heard. English and Scottish promoters were wary of Orbison as a draw; he was not conventionally attractive or animated while performing, and <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> if audiences would walk out. The tour sold out in one afternoon, however. Orbison's first meeting with John Lennon was awkward because Orbison was overwhelmed with the amount of advertising devoted to the Beatles when it was he who was supposed to headline the show. Beatlemania, however, was taking hold and Orbison accepted that he was not quite the main draw, so he decided to go first on stage. On opening night, the audience reacted intensely toward Orbison's ballads, as he finished with [...] "In Dreams". Philip Norman, a Beatles biographer, later wrote [...] "As Orbison performed, chinless and tragic, the Beatles stood in the wings, wondering how they would dare to follow him". After demanding Orbison play for double the time he was scheduled, the audience then screamed for a fifteenth encore, which Lennon and Paul McCartney refused to allow by holding Orbison back from re-entering the stage.|$|E

2500|$|Abu Bakr wept profusely and said, [...] "Our {{fathers and}} mothers be sacrificed for you." [...] The companions were {{astonished}} by this (<b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> why Abu Bakr wept), and the people said, [...] "Look at this old man! Allah's Apostle talks about a Slave of Allah to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says [...] "our {{fathers and mothers}} be sacrificed for you". It turned out Muhammad himself was that servant, as Abu Bakr later told the companions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>They</b> <b>wondered</b> why Boomers and G.I.s had {{developed}} such {{different ways of}} looking at the world, and what it was about these generations’ experiences growing up that prompted their different outlooks. [...] They also wondered whether any previous generations had acted along similar lines, and their research discussed historical analogues to the current generations. [...] The two ultimately described a recurring pattern in Anglo-American history of four generational types, each with a distinct collective persona, and a corresponding cycle of four different types of era, each with a distinct mood. The groundwork for this theory was laid out in Generations in 1991. [...] Strauss and Howe expanded on their theory and updated the terminology in The Fourth Turning in 1997. Generations helped popularize the idea that people in a particular age group tend to share a distinct set of beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors because they all grow up and come of age during a particular period in history.|$|E
2500|$|With {{just three}} {{suspects}} remaining, Inside Soap {{looked at them}} all and gave reasons why it can and cannot be each of them. They said that Jack and Kat's bond is undeniable since the loss of Jack's baby James; Jack has {{had a lot of}} recent sexual encounters, so it could be easy to imagine Kat being one of them; he is sensitive so is likely to start an affair that leads to love; he hasn't had a relationship since Ronnie went to prison; and as Jack is seeing Sharon, it would lead to [...] "EastEnders dream catfight". However, <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> why Jack would pursue Sharonwith whom he appears smittenif he is in love with Kat; Alfie has shown Jack [...] "real kindness" [...] over the baby swap and they could not believe that Jack would betray him; and Kat is not Jack's usual type, as he prefers [...] "a tragic blonde" [...] such as Ronnie or Sharon.|$|E

2500|$|After Ray and Michael were eliminated, Inside Soap {{looked at}} the last three {{suspects}} and gave reasons why it can and cannot be each of them. They said {{that if it was}} Max, it would cause [...] "maximum drama", bring [...] "the biggest aftershocks, [...] "rock Walford to its core" [...] and cause a [...] "fallout [...] would affect so many more people than the alternatives"; Max already has a secret, but it could be a red herring to make viewers believe he cannot be Kat's lover; he has already had a lot of affairs, often with brunettes; and [...] "it's always Max!" [...] However, they thought that the secret he is keeping is already [...] "enough drama"; he spent a long time to win Tanya back so <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> if he would fall in love with another woman at the same time; he prefers younger women such as Tanya, who was his son Bradley Branning's (Charlie Clements babysitter when he was married to his first wife, and Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who was Bradley's girlfriend; and Max has had so many affairs that [...] "it might feel as though EastEnders is going over old ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the movie came from a speech {{about the future of}} the news given in 2003 by Martin A. Nisenholtz, CEO of the New York Times Digital, given to the Software and Information Industry Association. Sloan showed the transcript to Thompson, which, after much discussion and brainstorming, led to, [...] "a very different interpretation of what Nisenholtz was talking about." [...] After some back and forth discussion while on a trip to Miami, Florida, Sloan and Thompson pondered Nisenholtz's original point when he mentioned the game Ultima Online and put it into the context of journalism. They soon agreed that it is the most advanced example of a medium people create by merely participating in it. The game, Ultima Online, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. As people play, they add to all the other players' experiences of the game, altering the whole fabric of the medium through their interactions with it. <b>They</b> <b>wondered,</b> [...] "what if you could apply that model to journalism?" [...] What if individuals could create and affect news stories simply by reading, viewing, and/or listening to them? ...|$|E

A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp (...) And suddenly he surprisingly disappeared. The wardens looked around the hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned to the fireplace, Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy (...) The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed {{that it was an}} escape case, though <b>they</b> <b>wondered</b> why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ...

2500|$|The {{first ever}} attempt at {{entry into the}} temple [...] was made {{by a group of}} about 200 Ezhava youth in 1803-4[...] Balarama Varma was the king of Travancore and Velu Thampi was the Dalawa (Diwan or Prime Minister). A date was fixed. Those who were in charge of the temple carried the news to the king and the {{authorities}} and the king promised to take necessary action. On the day of the proposed temple entry, an intelligence officer for the Maharaja’s army came to Vaikom, and met the temple authorities. <b>They</b> <b>wondered</b> how this single man would stop 200 able-bodied young men. The young men organized themselves into a procession from Tiruvelikkunnu on Kottayam Road [...] Their plan was to enter the temple from the eastern side. They gathered near Dalawa Kulam (a pond), about 150 meters east of the temple beyond which they were not permitted to move towards the temple. This pond, originally a small one meant for pilgrims to take bath before entering the temple, was renovated by Ramayyan Dalawa in 1750s and hence the name [...] "Dalawa Kulam’. [...] Koya Kutty had collected about a dozen Nair warriors from the locality, The sight of [...] Koya Kutty on horseback and [...] the Nairs on foot wielding swords scared the Ezhavas and they fled from the area. In the melee a few got injured and 2-3 people died falling in the pond. Later this incident {{came to be known as}} ‘Dalawa Kulam Incident’.The pond is no longer there. It is filled in and the present private bus stand is constructed there.|$|E
