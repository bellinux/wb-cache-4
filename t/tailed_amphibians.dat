60|$|Urodela.—First for the <b>tailed</b> <b>amphibians.</b> The sexes of {{salamanders}} or newts often differ much both in colour and structure. In {{some species}} prehensile claws are developed on the forelegs {{of the males}} during the breeding-season; and at this season in the male Triton palmipes the hind-feet are provided with a swimming web, which is almost completely absorbed during the winter; so that their feet then resemble those of the female.[38] This structure no doubt aids the male in his eager search and pursuit of the female. With our common newts (Triton punctatus and cristatus) a deep, much-indented crest is developed along the back and tail of the male during the breeding-season, being absorbed during the winter. It is not furnished, as Mr. St. George Mivart informs me, with muscles, and therefore cannot be used for locomotion. As during the season of courtship it becomes edged with bright colours, it serves, there can hardly be a doubt, as a masculine ornament. In many species the body presents strongly contrasted, though lurid tints; and these become more vivid during the breeding-season. The male, for instance, of our common little newt (Triton punctatus) is “brownish-grey above, passing into yellow beneath, which in the spring becomes a rich bright orange, marked everywhere with round dark spots.” The edge of the crest also is then tipped with bright red or violet. The female is usually of a yellowish-brown colour with scattered brown dots; and the lower surface is often quite plain.[39] The young are obscurely tinted. The ova are fertilised during the act of deposition and are not subsequently tended by either parent. We may therefore conclude that the males acquired their strongly-marked colours and ornamental appendages through sexual selection; these being transmitted either to the male offspring alone or to both sexes.|$|E

60|$|Section 3. The {{skin of the}} dog-fish {{is closely}} set with pointed tooth-like scales, the placoid scales, and these are {{continued}} over the lips into the mouth as teeth. Each scale consists of a base of true bone, with a little tubercle of a harder substance, dentine, capped by a still denser covering, the enamel. The enamel {{is derived from the}} outer layer of the embryonic dog-fish, the epiblast, which also gives rise to the epidermis; while the dentine and bony base arise in the underlying mesoblast, the dermis. A mammalian tooth has essentially the same structure: an outer coat of enamel, derived from epiblast, overlies a mass of dentine, resting on bone, but the dentine is excavated internally, to form a pulpcavity containing blood-vessels and nerves. Most land animals, however, have teeth only in their mouths, and have lost altogether the external teeth which constitute the armour of the dog-fish. Besides the teeth there perhaps remain relics of the placoid scales in the anatomy of the higher vertebrata, in the membrane bones. How placoid scales may have given rise to these structures will be understood by considering such a bone as the vomer of the frog. This bone lies {{on the roof of the}} frog's mouth, and bears a number of denticles, and altogether there is a very strong resemblance in it to a number of placoid scales the bony bases of which have become confluent. In the salamander, behind the teeth-bearing vomers comes a similar toothed parasphenoid bone. The same bone occurs in a corresponding position in the frog, but without teeth. In some <b>tailed</b> <b>amphibians</b> the vomers and splenials are known to arise by the fusion of small denticles. These facts seem to point to stages in the fusion of placoid bases, and their withdrawal from the surface to become incorporated with the cranial apparatus as membrane bones, a process entirely completed in the mammalian type.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Retinoids are low {{molecular}} weight, lipophilic derivatives of vitamin A which have profound effects upon {{the development of}} various embryonic systems. Here I review the effects on developing and regenerating limbs, regenerating <b>amphibian</b> <b>tails</b> and the developing central nervous system (CNS). In the regenerating amphibian limb, retinoids can proximalize, posterior-ize and ventralize the axes of the blastema. In the chick limb bud retinoids can only posteriorize the tissue. In the regenerating <b>amphibian</b> <b>tail</b> retinoids can homeotically transform tail tissue into hindlimb tissue. In the developing and regenerating limb retinoic acid has been detected endogenously, confirming that this molecule {{plays a role in}} the generation of pattern and we have shown that limbs cannot develop in the absence of retinoic acid. In the developing CNS retinoic acid specifically affects the hindbrain where it causes a transformation of anterior rhombomeres into more posterior ones. Again, endogenous retinoic acid has been detected in the CNS {{and in the absence of}} retinoids the posterior hindbrain has been found to be affected. The effects of retinoids on the CNS are most likely to be mediated via the Hox genes acting in the mesoderm after gastrulation. It has also been proposed that the establishment of the head-to-tail axis in the mesoderm is established by retinoic acid.

Earlier studies led us to propose a functional role for the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in tadpole tail regression. However, its physiological relevance has never been analyzed. We have now cloned a cDNA encoding Xenopus laevis bax (xlbax) and used in vivo gene transfer in tail muscle to analyze the effects of xlbax overexpression. Furthermore, by using an antisense strategy in a similar experimental paradigm, xlbax antisense mRNA was shown to block the apoptotic effects of xlbax and protect against apoptosis in metamorphosing tadpoles.

A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two clones of the original. Echinoderms (such as the starfish), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of autotomy, for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate. Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a Salamander or a Triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, Chelonians, crocodiles and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and Iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.|$|E

In the zebrafish, however, the first wave of neuromast deposition forms but a rudimentary PLL, and several additional waves are needed to form the adult pattern. We show that the amphibian mode is also present in the sturgeon and therefore probably represents the primitive mode, whereas the zebrafish mode is highly conserved in several teleost species. A third mode is found in a subgroup of teleosts, the protacanthopterygians, and may represent a synapomorphy of this group. Altogether, the mode of formation of the embryonic PLL appears to have undergone remarkably few changes during the long history of anamniote evolution, even though large differences can be observed in the lateral line morphology of adult fishes...|$|R

40|$|The {{elongation}} and shortening of the flounder fin rays {{during its}} metamorphosis may be {{parallel to the}} appearance and resorption of the tadpole <b>tail</b> during <b>amphibian</b> metamorphosis. The dorsal fin rays of the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) elongate during the time when thyroid hormone levels are low and are resorbed during climax of metamorphosis when thyroid levels are elevated. Using an in vitro system for culture of isolated flounder fin rays, we examined how various hormones affect the process of resorption. Both T 4 and T 3 directly stimulated fin ray shortening, T 3 being more potent than T 4. Other hormones did not directly affect the resorption process but modified the tissue's response to thyroid hormones. Cortisol enhanced the stimulatory effects of both T 4 and T 3. On the other hand, estradiol and testosterone were inhibitory. Ovine prolactin (oPRL) also diminished the effect of T 3 while ovine growth hormone (oGH) was without effect. Similar observations were observed from the in vivo studies. Thyroid hormone levels, especially T 4, were low during premetamorphosis, increased during prometamorphosis, to peak levels during metamorphic climax, and declined in the juveniles. The changes in whole body concentrations of Cortisol paralleled the changes in thyroid hormone concentrations. On the other hand, whole body estradiol and testosterone concentrations did not show significant change and remained low throughout the larval period. The expression of GH and PRLmRNA, as assessed by in situ hybridization using cDNA for flounder PRL and GH also increased during the metamorphosis. However, {{the increase in the}} expression of GH and PRL genes was observed later than the increases in tissue levels of thyroid hormones and Cortisol. At late climax, the flounder larvae have undergone considerable transformation, presumably triggered by both hormones, hence the increase in PRL could hardly be antimetamorphic but may have other physiological implications...|$|R
40|$|Paedomorphosis, the {{presence}} of ancestral larval and juvenile traits that occur at the descendent adult stage, is an evolutionary phenomenon that shaped morphological evolution in many vertebrate lineages, including <b>tailed</b> <b>amphibians.</b> Among salamandrid species, paedomorphic and metamorphic phenotypes can be observed within single populations (facultative paedomorphosis). Despite wide interest in facultative paedomorphosis and polymorphism produced by heterochronic changes (heterochronic polymorphism), the studies that investigate intraspecific morphological variation in facultative paedomorphic species are largely missing. By quantifying the cranium size and development (bone development and remodeling), we investigated the variation at multiple levels (i. e., between sexes, populations and species) of two facultatively paedomorphic European newt species: the alpine and the smooth newt. The pattern of variation between paedomorphs (individuals keeping larval traits at the adult stage) and metamorphs (metamorphosed adult individuals) varied between species and among populations within a single species. The patterns of variation in size and skull formation {{appear to be more}} uniform in the alpine than in the smooth newt, indicating that developmental constraints differed between species (more pronounced in alpine than in smooth newt).

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{response to}} interspecific competition is the partitioning {{of the resources}} used by the competing species. At the community level, the ultimate outcome of resource partitioning determines how communities evolve {{in terms of their}} species composition, explaining the distribution and abundance of organisms within natural assemblages. Despite amphibians having attracted considerable attention from population biologists, niche partitioning patterns have never been explored with a systematic approach in <b>tailed</b> <b>amphibians</b> (order Urodela). To fill this gap we tested whether Urodela communities are assembled in a non-random fashion along the trophic niche and which determinants (environmental factors and interspecific interactions) explained the observed patterns. We used a suite of statistical tools, including Generalized Linear Models and Null Models with Monte Carlo simulations, in order: (1) to explore the occurrence of non-random assemblage structure among the Urodela communities, and (2) to test environmental features (habitat) and interspecific interactions (exemplified by the overlap in species’ body size) as predictors of non-random assemblage composition. Our systematic review pointed out that: (1) the evolution of non-random structure in Urodela assemblages was determined by both biotic and abiotic factors, and (2) the food niche {{plays a key role in}} the coexistence of Urodela syntopic species. The considered assemblages showed a non-random structure influenced by diet, habitat and morphological features acting in an interactive fashion. Lawlor's RA 2 algorithm was more effective than any other randomization algorithms to reveal community structure based on interspecific competition. The assemblage structure was influenced by the niche breadth of the species in the generalist–specialist nature of the resource utilization: the much higher the niche breadth similarity among species, the most likely was a non-random structure in the assemblage. In an aquatic habitat, where species can partition the space in three dimensions, assemblages composed by species overlapping in body size and generalist in feeding behaviour show non-random structure. Conversely, in terrestrial habitats, probably due to the lack of vertical stratification, differently sized species composed assemblages in a non-random fashio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tail</b> {{resorption}} during <b>amphibian</b> metamorphosis {{has been}} {{thought to be}} controlled mainly by a cell-autonomous mechanism of programmed cell death triggered by thyroid hormone. However, we have proposed a role for the immune response in metamorphosis, based on the finding that syngeneic grafts of tadpole tail skin into adult Xenopus animals are rejected by T cells. To test this, we identified two tail antigen genes called ouro 1 and ouro 2 that encode keratin-related proteins. Recombinant Ouro 1 and Ouro 2 proteins generated proliferative responses in vitro in T cells isolated from naive adult Xenopus animals. These genes were expressed specifically in the tail skin at the climax of metamorphosis. Overexpression of ouro 1 and ouro 2 induced T-cell accumulation and precocious tail degeneration after full differentiation of adult-type T cells when overexpressed in the tail region. When the expression of ouro 1 and ouro 2 were knocked down, tail skin tissue remained even after metamorphosis was complete. Our findings indicate that Ouro proteins participate {{in the process of}} tail regression as immune antigens and highlight the possibility that the acquired immune system contributes not only to self-defense but also to remodeling processes in vertebrate morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{size and}} shape of tissues are tightly {{controlled}} by synchronized processes among cells and tissues to produce an integrated organ. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both cell proliferation and apoptosis by dual signal-transduction states regulated through a repressive kinase cascade. Yap 1 and Tead, transcriptional regulators that act downstream of the Hippo signaling kinase cascade, have essential roles in regulating cell proliferation. In <b>amphibian</b> limb or <b>tail</b> regeneration, the local tissue outgrowth terminates when the correct size is reached, suggesting that organ size is strictly controlled during epimorphic organ-level regeneration. We recently demonstrated that Yap 1 is required for the regeneration of Xenopus tadpole limb buds (Hayashi et al., 2014, Dev. Biol. 388, 57 – 67), but the molecular link between the Hippo pathway and organ size control in vertebrate epimorphic regeneration is not fully understood. To examine the requirement of Hippo pathway transcriptional regulators in epimorphic regeneration, including organ size control, we inhibited these regulators during Xenopus tadpole tail regeneration by overexpressing a dominant-negative form of Yap (dnYap) or Tead 4 (dnTead 4) under a heat-shock promoter in transgenic animal lines. Each inhibition resulted in regeneration defects accompanied by reduced cell mitosis and increased apoptosis. Single-cell gene manipulation experiments indicated that Tead 4 cell-autonomously regulates the survival of neural progenitor cells in the regenerating <b>tail.</b> In <b>amphibians,</b> amputation at the proximal level of the tail (deep amputation) results in faster regeneration than that at the distal level (shallow amputation), to restore the original-sized tail with similar timing. However, dnTead 4 overexpression abolished the position-dependent differential growth rate of tail regeneration. These results suggest that the transcriptional regulators in the Hippo pathway, Tead 4 and Yap 1, are required for general vertebrate epimorphic regeneration as well as for organ size control in appendage regeneration. In regenerative medicine, these findings should {{contribute to the development of}} three-dimensional organs with the correct size for a patient’s body...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{amphioxus}} tail bud {{is similar}} to the <b>amphibian</b> <b>tail</b> bud in having an epithelial organization without a mesenchymal component. We characterize three amphioxus Wnt genes (AmphiWnt 3, AmphiWnt 5, and AmphiWnt 6) and show that their early expression around the blastopore can subsequently be traced into the tail bud; in vertebrate embryos, there is a similar progression of expression domains for Wnt 3, Wnt 5, and Wnt 6 genes from the blastopore lip (or its equivalent) to the tail bud. In amphioxus, AmphiWnt 3, AmphiWnt 5, and AmphiWnt 6 are each expressed in a specific subregion of the tail bud, tentatively suggesting that a combinatorial code of developmental gene expression may help generate specific tissues during posterior elongation and somitogenesis. In spite of similarities within their tail buds, vertebrate and amphioxus embryos differ markedly in the relation between the tail bud and the nascent somites: vertebrates have a relatively extensive zone of unsegmented mesenchyme (i. e., presomitic mesoderm) intervening between the tail bud and the forming somites, whereas the amphioxus tail bud gives rise to new somites directly. It is likely that presomitic mesoderm is a vertebrate innovation made possible by developmental interconversions between epithelium and mesenchyme that first became prominent at the dawn of vertebrate evolution...|$|R

These models {{are easy to}} shape and they retain predator marks, allowing {{the identification of the}} body part attacked and of the predator. In herpetological studies, prey models are used to evaluate colour polymorphism, aposematism, mimicry and to assess differential predation rates in different habitats. Clay models have been applied in studies on both <b>tailed</b> and tailless <b>amphibians</b> in different geographic regions, with a first application in Europe by Velo-Antón & Cordero Rivera (2011). The present research aimed to evaluate by means of realistic clay models: i) if different potential predation rates were observed on the plethodontid salamander Speleomantes strinatii living in different habitats, and ii) if the presence of a brooding female reduced the potential predation of attended egg clutches, in comparison to unattended clutches. The results show that predators attacked the models significantly more (P < 0. 01) in woodlands (43 attacked models out of 90) than inside caves (16 attacked model out of 94). Therefore, salamander populations inhabiting underground environments may benefit from reduced predation risk in comparison to forest-dwelling populations (Salvidio et al. 2017). Concerning the second experiment, similar predation rates on isolated eggs and on eggs attended by females were observed. This may suggest that all kind of models (i. e. eggs and/or salamanders) were not discriminated by the predators and attacked with similar frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the {{dissolution}} of cartilage matrix by vitamin A in vivo and in vitro have in-dicated that the vitamin acts, at least in part, by releasing endogenous acid proteases from cartilage cells (1 - 5). Dingle (6) found that vitamin A alcohol in vitro liberated acid protease(s) from a particulate fraction of rat liver homogenized in 0. 25 M sucrose. This fraction of tissue homoge-nates contained the bulk of acid hydrolases inti-mately bound to lysosomes, cytoplasmic organelles described by de Duve (7). Observations from this laboratory, based on earlier experiments by Dingle, suggested that the induction of hypervitaminosis A in vivo caused a similar release of acid protease from lysosomes (8, 9); the action of such enzymes was held re-sponsible for the degradation of protein-polysac-charide complexes in connective tissue. Morpho-logic expressions of this phenomenon {{could be seen in}} rabbit ear and articular cartilage (8) and in the connective tissue (9) of <b>amphibian</b> <b>tails,</b> tentacles, and chondrocranium.

Hydro-cortisone retarded the release of acid hydrolases from a large granule fraction prepared from rat and rabbit liver after traumatic shock (11) or the injection of bacterial endotoxins (12), and dimin-ished the release effected by mercury arc irradia-tion (13).

40|$|AbstractExpression {{of genes}} up-regulated by thyroid hormone (TH) during <b>amphibian</b> <b>tail</b> {{resorption}} was localized byin situhybridization. The constitutive thyroid hormone receptor (TRα) and its heterodimeric partners (RXRα and RXRβ) are expressed ubiquitously in the resorbing tail. A group of early response genes, including those encoding transcription factors, are expressed at greatest levels within tissues whose cells attempt {{to grow and}} differentiate in the tail, but eventually succumb to the resorption program. The TH-inducible TR isoform, TRβ, is expressed ubiquitously in the tail, but especially high in fibroblasts. Similarly, a group of delayed response genes including two proteolytic enzymes that appear to execute the tail resorption program, is expressed specifically in fibroblasts that line and surround the notochord and lie beneath the epidermal lamella (subepidermal fibroblasts). During active tail resorption these fibroblasts invade their neighboring epidermal and notochord lamellae {{as part of the}} resorption process. Expression analysis implicates the single layer of invasive subepidermal fibroblasts as crucial in tail resorption. Stromelysin- 3 is up-regulated by TH with early kinetics, and is expressed most actively in fibroblasts within the tail fins. None of the proteases are expressed in the tadpole epidermis, which will be replaced entirely during metamorphosis. While very few TH response genes are expressed in tadpole muscle, many are activated in fibroblasts that surround muscle and could induce muscle cell death by proteolysis of the extracellular matrix. These distinct localization patterns suggest that the common fate of all cell types within the tail is the result of multiple genetic programs...|$|R
40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes in}} color and pattern that are not {{directly}} related to reproduction are very common yet remain a poorly understood phenomenon. One example is conspicuous colors in the <b>tails</b> of fish, <b>amphibians,</b> and reptiles that fade out later in life. We suggest a novel hypothesis: conspicuous tail colors that appear only in juveniles compensate for an increased activity level, deflecting imminent attacks to the tail. We observed blue-tailed, newly hatched lizards (Acanthodactylus beershebensis) in the field and compared 5 behavioral parameters with those of older individuals that had already lost their neonate coloration. In addition, we explored whether tail displays, often assumed to direct a predator’s attention to the tail, disappear with the color change. Striped blue-tailed hatchlings foraged more actively than 3 -week-old juveniles, spent a longer time in open microhabitats, and performed deflective tail displays. In comparison, 2 other lacertids that do not undergo ontogenetic change did not switch to safer foraging when growing up. The results suggest that activity alteration may be a major factor affecting the ontogenetic color and pattern change. Active lizards that forage in open habitats increase their probability of attack by ambush predators. Conspicuous colors and deflection displays may shift attacks to the expendable tail, increasing the prey’s overall probability of surviving attacks. The persistence of both striped body pattern and blue tail fits the active foraging period of neonates and hence may be appropriate for other species that display a conspicuous tail accompanied by a striped pattern. Key words: Acanthodactylus beershebensis, antipredatory behavior, autotomy, foraging activity, ontogeny.

40|$|Realization of the {{projects}} on deciphering genomes of several model organisms {{has led to the}} understand ing that the more complicated is the organism the less is the portion of proteincoding sequences in the genome, while the number of functional proteinnon coding sequences increases [1]. Only a small part of transcribed DNA sequences encodes proteins in ani mal and plant cells [2], and among long and short RNAs synthesized by the cell numerous transcripts do not code for protein products, but are important for the realization of genetic information and regulation of gene expression [3 – 5]. Studying the cell functions of regulatory protein noncoding RNAs and RNA organizers of nuclear domains in developing female germline cells is partic ularly important regarding the possibility of involve ment of maternal RNA in functional compartmental ization of the germinal vesicle and in the regulation of the embryo genome [6]. It is convenient to analyze the functions of proteinnoncoding DNA sequences in oogenesis using as a model system lampbrush chromo somes (LBCs) (Fig. 1 a) that are characteristic of grow ing oocytes in many animal species [7, 8]. The main advantages of this system are giant sizes of LBCs, a rel atively simple procedure of their microsurgical isola tion from oocyte nuclei, possibility of mapping DNA sequences with an unprecedentally high resolution, thousands of morphologically distinguishable long transcriptional units, a high rate of RNA synthesis, and, what is particularly important, the feasibility of cytological analysis of cotranscriptional stages of RNA processing. The classical studies of LBCs from oocytes of <b>tailed</b> and tailless <b>amphibians</b> made an essential contribution to the understanding of many problems concerning the organization and functions of the eukaryotic genome [9, 10]. It is with the use of lampbrush chro mosomes that initial cytological evidence for satellite DNA transcription was obtained [11, 12]. The tech nique of LBC isolation adapted for avian oocyte...|$|R
