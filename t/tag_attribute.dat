50|$|Nevow (pronounced {{like the}} French nouveau) is a Python web {{application}} framework originally {{developed by the}} company Divmod. Template substitution is achieved via a small <b>Tag</b> <b>Attribute</b> Language, which is usually embedded in on-disk XML templates, though {{there is also a}} pure-Python domain-specific language called Stan, for expressing this markup programmatically. Nevow integrates well with Twisted, a framework for event-driven programming.|$|E
50|$|An {{extensible}} set of attributes describe objects. Some attributes {{are implemented}} {{directly by the}} OSD, such {{as the number of}} bytes in an object and the modify time of an object. There is a special policy <b>tag</b> <b>attribute</b> {{that is part of the}} security mechanism. Other attributes are uninterpreted by the OSD. These are set on objects by the higher-level storage systems that use the OSD for persistent storage. For example, attributes might be used to classify objects, or to capture relationships among different objects stored on different OSDs.|$|E
50|$|Another early browser, Silversmith, {{was created}} by John Bottoms in 1987. The browser, based on SGML tags, used a tag set from the Electronic Document Project of the AAP with minor {{modifications}} and was sold {{to a number of}} early adopters. At the time SGML was used exclusively for the formatting of printed documents. The use of SGML for electronically displayed documents signaled a shift in electronic publishing and was met with considerable resistance. Silversmith included an integrated indexer, full text searches, hypertext links between images text and sound using SGML tags and a return stack for use with hypertext links. It included features that are still not available in today's browsers. These include capabilities such as the ability to restrict searches within document structures, searches on indexed documents using wild cards and the ability to search on <b>tag</b> <b>attribute</b> values and attribute names.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for RFID <b>tag</b> <b>attribute</b> match-ing problem. Unlike previous approaches, most notably the T-Match protocol, presented in [9], {{we do not need}} a central database server or any connectiv-ity between readers. Furthermore, we do not need expensive homomorphic encryption or multiparty computation and we extend attribute matching to multiple attributes per tag; a feature that broadens the range of possible ap-plications of the protocol. We achieve this increased flexibility and decreased complexity by moving some relatively cheap cryptographic computations to the tags. Specifically, one of the protocols presented in this paper only needs a (lightweight) hash function implemented on the tags. Two other protocols additionally need asymmetric encryption, which is feasible on more powerful tags that support elliptic-curve scalar multiplication...|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} tag, {{there are many}} kinds of tags such as {{content-based}} tag, context-based <b>tag,</b> <b>attribute</b> tag, ownership tag and purpose tag [5]. The tagging system provides a particular kind. For content-based tags, the suggested tags may be significant terms because of their term frequency. For example, information in Fig.  1 is suggested with the tag Rice because the term rice has maximum frequency. Regarding semantic similarity, multiple tags may have the same meaning or may refer to the same thing. For example, Kao Horm Mali is jasmine rice in Thai with English spelling. The users must rely on their own intuition to pick the appropriate tags when multiple tags represent the same meaning. In this paper, the auto-tagging methodology is proposed and this concerns both term frequency and semantic similarity.|$|E
40|$|By {{attaching}} RFID tags to products, {{supply chain}} participants can identify products and create product data {{to record the}} product particulars in transit. Participants along the supply chain share their product data to enable information exchange and support critical decisions in production operations. Such an information sharing essentially requires a data access control mechanism when the product data relates to sensitive business issues. However, existing access control solutions are ill suited to the RFID-enabled supply chain, as they are not scalable in handling {{a huge number of}} tags, introduce vulnerability to the product data, and performs poorly to support privilege revocation of product data. We present a new scalable data access control system that addresses these limitations. Our system provides an item-level data access control mechanism that defines and enforces access policies based on both the participants' role attribute and the products' RFID <b>tag</b> <b>attribute.</b> Our system further provides an item-level privilege revocation mechanism by allowing the participants to delegate encryption updates in revocation operation without disclosing the underlying data contents. We design a new updatable encryption scheme and integrate it with Cipher text Policy-Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) to implement the key components of our system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays,the {{information}} hiding {{technology is a}} hot spot {{in the field of}} information security, and is applied in many fields,such as digital multimedia copyright protection and secret communication. According to the analysis of the characteristics of browser in parsing HTML of the webpage and the little capacity available for information hided in webpage, a new robust webpage {{information hiding}} method with the slash of <b>tag</b> <b>attributes</b> has been proposed in this paper, which overcomes the shortcoming of the ability of imperceptibility and the ability of contradict with the machine filtration of traditional webpage information hiding algorithms and has greater embedded capacity than some other algorithm based on <b>tag</b> <b>attributes.</b> This method has good performances in invisibility and higher applied value as proved by the experiments...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study of HTML {{structure}} of documents on World Wide Web.

A similar study was conducted by Woodruff et al [WAB 96] in 1996 to examine various HTML structural characteristics. The main goal of our study was to analyze the existing structure of HTML documents on the web and see how it has changed since the previous study in 1996.

40|$|Owing to {{the booming}} growth of Internet technology, {{the number of}} web {{documents}} has significantly increased over the Internet. If the webpage can be effectively managed, the knowledge demanders (i. e., Internet users) can efficiently absorb and use the knowledge documents; {{it has become the}} core topic in this information explosion era. Webpage classification technology with high accuracy can improve the efficiency for Internet users to search required knowledge and to save lots of knowledge-searching time. Differing from previous researches, this paper explores webpage design characteristics for webpage classification. That is, concerning complexity of webpage structure, this paper analyzes the webpage design characteristics including <b>tag</b> <b>attributes</b> and tag-region layout to develop an algorithm for webpage classification. Therefore, based on webpage design characteristic analysis, the text contained in specific tag-regions can be identified. Also, the keywords extracted from each tag-region are weighted according <b>tag</b> <b>attributes</b> and tag-region locations; then, the categories of the target webpage can be determined. Furthermore, based on the hyperlink tag, the similar webpage with higher correlations can be collected to re-determine target webpage categories. In addition to the webpage classification algorithm, a web-based webpage classification system is developed to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed model. The attempt of this research is to analyze and use the characteristics of webpage design for webpage classification technology to improve the effectiveness of classification...|$|R

30|$|The {{first step}} in feature {{extraction}} is to segment the text (Gao et al. 2003). This is because words and words are put together without blank spaces in Chinese, unlike English, where there are spaces between words. Therefore, the {{first step in}} Chinese Natural Language Processing is to separate words within sentences. For example, the process divides the sentence “今天天气真好啊!” (The weather today is really good!) into “今天 天气 真 好 啊” (The / weather / today / is / really / good!). Next part is part-of-speech tagging. As its name suggests, <b>tagging</b> <b>attributes</b> are marking attributes to a word, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.|$|R
