5000|$|Swage (compression) {{fittings}} or {{cable clips}} {{are used to}} terminate counterweight system lift lines, after the cable has been looped around a <b>thimble.</b> <b>Cable</b> clips terminations maintain less load capacity than swage fittings, typically require three clips, and are greatly reduced in load capacity if the installer happened to [...] "saddle a dead horse". Both swage and cable clip terminations permanently crimp (deform) the wire rope.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Sunbursts {{suffered}} structural failures {{that resulted in}} fatal accidents. The cause was traced to cable attachment brackets that were made with rough holes that over time in service sawed through the <b>cable</b> <b>thimbles</b> and caused the flight cables to break. This was addressed by replacing the brackets.|$|R
