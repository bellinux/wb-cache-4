50|$|The Company {{was founded}} by Sir David McMurtry and John Deer in 1973. McMurtry had needed to measure fuel pipes on a {{prototype}} jet engine: at the time, coordinate-measuring machine sensors featured rigid styli, which required manual positioning {{on the surface and}} which yielded poor repeatability when measuring delicate components. To meet this need, McMurtry invented a <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probe</b> device, which he then patented. The probe featured an elegant 'kinematic' location for a spring-loaded stylus, providing a highly repeatable seated position for the stylus combined with the compliance needed to measure such components.|$|E

40|$|To measure various {{components}} with nano-scale precision, a new high-precision <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probe</b> using a single low-cost sensor for a micro-coordinate measuring machine (CMM) {{is presented in}} this paper. The sensor is composed of a laser diode, a plane mirror, a focusing lens, and a quadrant photo detector (QPD). The laser beam from the laser diode with an incident angle is reflected by the plane mirror and then projected onto the quadrant photo detector (QPD) via the focusing lens. The plane mirror is adhered to the upper surface of the floating plate supported by an elastic mechanism, which can transfer the displacement of the stylus’s ball tip in 3 D to the plane mirror’s vertical and tilt movement. Both motions of the plane mirror can be detected by respective QPDs. The probe mechanism was analyzed, and its structural parameters that conform {{to the principle of}} uniform sensitivity and uniform stiffness were obtained. The simulation result showed that the stiffness was equal in 3 D and less than 1 mN/µm. Some experiments were performed to investigate the probe’s characteristics. It was found that the probe could detect the trigger point with uniform sensitivity, a resolution of less than 5 nm, and a repeatability of less than 4 nm.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{amount of}} today’s research {{within the field}} of dimensional metrology is dedicated to multi-sensor and non-contact measurements. Tactile probing on a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) however is inherently different. Although tactile probing is considered more accurate, it often ignores smaller surface details. In essence it means that tactile approaches measure a mechanically filtered surface while the non-contact measurement principles take into account most surface details. The research presented focuses on the offsets due to surface roughness between <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probing</b> on a CMM and three non-contact measurement principles (X-ray computed tomography (CT), CMM camera vision and CMM laser line scanning). Results show significantly correlating trends between the offset and the surface roughness. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a performance evaluation test for laser line scanners on 3 D coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). Laser line scanners {{are becoming more}} popular in recent years, mainly for free form inspection tasks and reverse engineering. Error specification of these scanners is difficult because of many influencing factors like surface quality, surface orientation and scan depth. Therefore, procedures for evaluation and verification of conventional contact <b>probes</b> (e. g. <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probes)</b> are not appropriate for non-contact laser line scanners. A straightforward test method that uses a planar test artefact is proposed. It enables to identify the influence of in-plane and out-of-plane angle, as well as scan depth on systematic and random errors of the laser scanner. Experimental {{results show that the}} tested commercial laser scanner, after calibration, exhibits systematic errors of about 10 um. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Dimensional quality {{inspections}} of high precision parts are often performed by Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) equipped with <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probes.</b> Features of these parts are then {{measured with a}} limited set of points, due to time constraints. This limited sampling has an important influence on the measurement uncertainty because the form deviation of the feature can not be completely assessed. It will not only affect the measurement uncertainty of the form deviation, but also the measurement uncertainties of other feature parameters like size, position and orientation. The quantification of this influence is difficult since the true form deviation is unknown. This paper describes a method, based on Monte Carlo simulations, that allows to determine these measurement uncertainties based on {{an estimate of the}} form deviation using a limited set of points. The method is illustrated for circles with theoretical shapes of form deviations, as well as measured shapes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{errors and}} structural thermal deformation are {{factors that influence}} the machining accuracy of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining center. Therefore, researchers pay attention to thermal error compensation technologies on CNC machine tools. Some real-time error compensation techniques have been successfully demonstrated in both laboratories and industrial sites. The compensation results {{still need to be}} enhanced. In this research, the neural-fuzzy theory has been conducted to derive a thermal prediction model. An IC-type thermometer has been used to detect the heat sources temperature variation. The thermal drifts are online measured by a <b>touch-triggered</b> <b>probe</b> with a standard bar. A thermal prediction model is then derived by neural-fuzzy theory based on the temperature variation and the thermal drifts. A Graphic User Interface (GUI) system is also built to conduct the user friendly operation interface with Insprise C++ Builder.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the problem}} of {{controlling}} the errors caused by the machine is addressed. The quasistatic errors are identified as {{the major source of}} dimensional errors and a practical approach for an automated machine shop floor is developed. ^ The thesis describes various sources of quasistatic errors and methods used to control them. The problem of modeling the geometric errors of a machine and periodically updating this model is identified as being central to the strategy for controlling the quasistatic error. ^ This model is developed by using rigid body kinematics. Shape and Joint transformations are developed for inaccurate links and joints(axes). The kinematic equations for a three-axis machine are then solved, assuming linear error characteristics for its joints. ^ The problem of applying this model to the compensation of errors of a NC machine working in a manufacture environment is addressed. To accomplish this, {{the problem of}} determining the model 2 ̆ 7 s parameters by a simple procedure which can be executed between work cycles of the machine is found to be essential. It is then shown that, when the positioning errors of the axes are removed from the error model, the rest of the geometric error components can be determined by simple linear measurements at nine reference points in the workspace. This proves {{that it is possible to}} update the model 2 ̆ 7 s parameters at regular intervals, and possible to compensate the errors caused by the quasistatic effects. ^ Finally, this thesis contains the experimental verification of the error model and the updating procedure. Using <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probes</b> and a reference frame, the errors across a 2 -D section of the workspace are predicted. The comparison of the predicted and observed errors proves conclusively the effectiveness of the model and the updating procedure. An order of magnitude improvement was observed in the locational accuracy across the 2 -D workspace. ^ The geometric error model developed in this thesis, besides its obvious application in error compensation, can be used in the selection of members with matching error characteristics at the design stage of the machine to improve the expected accuracy. Extensions to 5 -axis machines and industrial robots are also possible. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.) ...|$|R
40|$|As a {{basis to}} improve the motion {{accuracy}} of five-axis machining centers, {{it is important to}} develop a methodology to calibrate location errors of rotary axes, one of the fundamental error sources in the five-axis kinematics, in an accurate, efficient, and automated manner.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the work was to compare the {{coordinate}} measurement results of a particle detector support structure to a computer-aided tolerance analysis and simulation. Another aim was to ensure and improve the long-term reliability and repeatability of the coordinate measurement process of the product.

The first manufacturing batches, comprising tens of support structures, were measured with a computer-controlled coordinate-measuring machine equipped with a <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probe.</b> Instead of just measuring each support structure once, an extensive set of repetitive measurements of a single structure was made to estimate measurement repeatability and reproducibility that describe the measurement uncertainty. Moreover, the measurement process was documented in detail.

40|$|Laser line {{scanning}} is a laser based measurement method to acquire dimensional information of a workpiece. The most common applications {{are found in}} e. g. automotive and medical industry. The advantages of laser line CMM probing are a high data density and a high measurement speed. This makes the probe ideal to measure three dimensional free form surfaces. To align freeform parts in a precise manner however, features (e. g. cylinders, spheres) are used to allocate the position. The newest generation of laser line scanners can have an MPEP of below 10 µm. The {{first part of the}} paper presents a reference object with drilled holes of different diameters. The influences of the diameter of the feature and the in-plane viewing angle on the measuring depth range are investigated on this reference object. The results can then be converted to an aspect ratio limitation that restricts the feature dimensions for full inspection. The second part compares the accuracy and the repeatability of a Nikon Metrology LC 60 Dx digital laser line scanner and a Renishaw TP 200 <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probe,</b> using two case study objects that incorporate cylindrical features. The experimental case takes into account different surface finishes and the previously acquired results on the aspect ratio of the measurement.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in versatile automated gauging have enabled accurate geometric tolerance assessment on the shop floor. This paper {{is concerned with}} the uncertainty evaluation associated with comparative coordinate measurement using the design of experiments (DOE) approach. It employs the Renishaw Equator which is a software-driven comparative gauge based on the traditional comparison of production parts to a reference master part. The fixturing requirement of each production part to the master part is approximately ± 1 mm for a comparison process with an uncertainty of ± 2 μm. Therefore, a number of experimental designs are applied with the main focus on the influence of part misalignment from rotation between master and measure coordinate frames on the comparator measurement uncertainty. Other factors considered include measurement mode mainly in scanning and <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probing</b> (TTP) and alignment procedure used to establish the coordinate reference frame (CRF) with respect to the number of contact points used for each geometric feature measured. The measurement uncertainty analysis of the comparator technique used by the Equator gauge commences with a simple measurement task using a gauge block to evaluate the three-dimensional (3 D) uncertainty of length comparative coordinate measurement influenced by an offset by tilt in one direction (two-dimensional angular misalignment). Then, a specific manufactured measurement object is employed so that the comparator measurement uncertainty can be assessed for numerous measurement tasks within a satisfactory range of the working volume of the versatile gauge. Furthermore, in the second case study, different types of part misalignment including both 2 D and 3 D angular misalignments are applied. The time required for managing the re-mastering process is also examined. A task specific uncertainty evaluation is completed using DOE. Also, investigating the effects of process variations that might be experienced by such a device in workshop environments. It is shown that the comparator measurement uncertainties obtained by all the experiments agree with system features under specified conditions. It is also demonstrated that when the specified conditions are exceeded, the comparator measurement uncertainty is associated with the measurement task, the measurement strategy used, the feature size, and the magnitude and direction of offset angles in relation to the reference axes of the machine. In particular, departures from the specified part fixturing requirement of Equator have a more significant effect on the uncertainty of length measurement in comparator mode and a less significant effect on the diameter measurement uncertainty for the specific Equator and test conditions...|$|R
40|$|Workpiece {{localization}} {{refers to}} the following problem: assuming a rigid workpiece is arbitrarily fixtured to a work table, determine the position and orientation of the workpiece frame relative to some known world reference frame. In this dissertation, {{we focus on the}} development of a computer-aided setup (CAS) system. Several important building blocks of such a system are discussed, including robust algorithms, accurate compensation method and a computer-aided probing strategy. Two computer-aided setup systems, on the basis of both an open architecture CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine and a conventional CNC machine, are built and tested. The contributions of this dissertation are as follows: First, we presented a new problem found in previous symmetric localization algorithms, specifically, the problem of discrete multiple solutions for symmetric localizations. We showed that the problem was caused by some missing components of the symmetry subgroups G 0 in previous research. Modified symmetry subgroup G 0 s of symmetric features were given. Simulation results with the modified symmetric localization algorithm showed that the discrete multiple solutions problem no longer appeared. To make the localization algorithms more applicable to a computer-aided setup system, a unified updating algorithm was presented which can be applied to both 3 D general workpieces and symmetric workpieces. This actually supplies a robust localization to the implementation of a CAS system. Next, to make online measurement practical, we addressed the probe radius compensation problem. Different kinds of compensation methods were reviewed. We proposed a new compensation method for workpiece localization application. We compared the performance of our proposed method with other existing methods. It was shown that our proposed method had the best performance both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which makes the compensation method applicable to a computer-aided setup system. We presented the optimal planning problem for workpiece measurement. A sequential optimization algorithm was introduced to obtain an optimal-determinant solution. Then, based on reliability analysis of localization solutions and the sequential optimization algorithm, a computer-aided probing strategy was proposed. With this strategy, given the desired translation and orientation error bounds and the desired confidence limit, we could experimentally find the least number of points needed to measure, while both error bounds were satisfitid. Simulation results showed the computer-aided probing strategy supplies it basic method for online probing. Finally, two computer-aided setup systems were built on the basis of both an open architecture CNC machine and a conventional CNC machine. The integrated systems consisted of three main modules: a <b>touch-trigger</b> <b>probe</b> systtlrn for data collection, a user graphic interface for model viewing and data inspecting, and compensated localization algorithms. Experimental results showed that the system is suitable for real-time implementation in manufacturing process...|$|E
