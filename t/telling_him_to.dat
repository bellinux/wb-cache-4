5|$|Influential {{players and}} journalists belittled the 1894 match {{both before and}} after it took place. Lasker's {{difficulty}} in getting backing may have been caused by hostile pre-match comments from Gunsberg and Leopold Hoffer, who had long been a bitter enemy of Steinitz. One of the complaints was that Lasker had never played the other two members of the top four, Siegbert Tarrasch and Mikhail Chigorin – although Tarrasch had rejected a challenge from Lasker in 1892, publicly <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go and win an international tournament first. After the match, some commentators, notably Tarrasch, said Lasker had won mainly because Steinitz was old (58 in 1894).|$|E

Middleton wrote back to Ramcke <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored.
