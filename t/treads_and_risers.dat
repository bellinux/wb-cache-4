50|$|The steps {{themselves}} are solid, one piece, die-cast aluminum or steel. Yellow demarcation lines are sometimes added {{to indicate their}} edges.

40|$|Susu Dam is an RCC Dam under {{construction}} in Peninsula Malaysia. The dam design {{has been carried out}} by SMEC International in its offices in Kuala Lumpur. The dam is some 90 m tall. The overfall stepped spillway provides for discharges to enter a hydraulic jump stilling basin for energy dissipation, prior to passing through a culvert under a roadway. The spillway was subject to hydraulic model testing at the Utah Water Research Laboratory of Utah State University (USA), at a length scale of 1 : 30. The hydraulic performance of the spillway design was evaluated up to the 4, 700 m 3 /s Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) discharge (almost 1, 000 L/s model scale). The spillway was tested through a number of configurations, prior {{to the development of the}} final arrangement. The purpose of the paper is to describe the modelling detail, and then focus on the flow behaviour at the stair-stepped spillway chute with 2. 4 m high steps, in particular the piezometric pressures and transient pressures on the <b>tread</b> <b>and</b> <b>riser</b> of the steps. The spillway chute converged from ~ 100 m at the crest to 78 m at the bottom at entrance to the stilling basin; the unit discharge entering the stilling basin was ~ 60 m 2 /s for the PMF. Of particular interest was the occurrence of negative pressures on the steps, and the paper will describe the transients for several discharges from the AEP 1 in 1, 000 up to the PMF; the results indicating very low pressures into a cavitation region. The design provides for an aerator across the spillway in order to counter the effects of possible cavitation. Results will be presented with and without the aerator operating. The paper provides useful design information for the hydraulic design of stepped spillways...|$|R

40|$|Turf-banked {{terraces}} in {{the alpine}} tundra of Glacier National Park, Montana, are typically characterized by alternating stripes of flat, stone-covered <b>treads</b> or steps <b>and</b> angled <b>risers</b> covered by alpine tundra vegetation. Previous research {{has suggested that}} the presence of turf-banked terraces is controlled by local environmental settings, particularly, topographic conditions. In this research, regression analysis is used to assess the correlations between turf-banked terrace characteristics and a set of hypothesized environmental controls. Measures of turf-banked terraces include the widths and standard deviations of <b>treads,</b> <b>risers,</b> <b>and</b> all stripes measured at 55 areally distributed 50 -m field transects; the ratio of riser width to <b>tread</b> width; <b>and</b> a set of four one-dimensional pattern metrics that assess the spatial structure of the tread/riser sequences. These measures were derived using a run-length approach for field transects distributed in basins located throughout {{the eastern side of the}} Continental Divide. The environmental variables, generated from a 10 -m spatial resolution digital elevation model (DEM), include elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, slope curvature, and soil moisture potential. Our results show that several turf-banked terrace characteristics are significantly correlated with individual environmental variables; stronger relationships are found when turf-banked terrace characteristics are related to transformed (i. e., principal components analysis) environmental variables using multiple regression analysis...|$|R
