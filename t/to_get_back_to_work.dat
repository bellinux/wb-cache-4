25|$|In late 2011, Ports of Auckland became {{engaged in}} an {{industrial}} dispute with workers represented by the Maritime Union of New Zealand, after negotiations broke down over the expiry of the existing collective contract, and plans by the port to contract out its services to casual workers. The company board cited a Productivity Commission report calling for greater flexibility in the ports industry, {{and the need to}} compete with its nearest rival, Port of Tauranga. The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) and International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) later became involved, warning that Ports of Auckland could be declared the world's first 'port of convenience'. Port workers {{in other parts of the}} country briefly downed tools in support of the striking Auckland workers, before being ordered <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|Filming {{began on}} September 26, 2005 in Baltimore and lasted 45 days. The film had minimal visual effects, with {{no need for}} greenscreen work. Instead, the {{director}} shot from odd camera angles and claustrophobic spaces to increase tension in the film. In October 2006, The Visiting changed to the title of The Invasion, due to the cancellation of the ABC TV series. The studio, however, was unhappy with Hirschbiegel's results and hired The Wachowskis to rewrite the film and assist with additional shooting. The studio later hired director James McTeigue to perform re-shoots that would cost $10million, an uncredited duty by McTeigue. After 13 months of inactivity, re-shoots took place in January 2007 to increase action scenes and add a twist ending. The re-shoot lasted for 17 days in Los Angeles. During the re-shooting, Kidman was involved in an accident, while in a Jaguar that was being towed by a stunt driver and {{was taken to a}} hospital briefly. Kidman broke several ribs, but she was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> soon after being hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Miklós finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. As the boy runs away, guards run past {{in the direction of the}} shed.

500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, but now it was time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E
