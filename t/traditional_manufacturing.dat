25|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} onwards, Liverpool's docks and <b>traditional</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{industries}} declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs.

Leaving aside <b>traditional</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> such as sugar refining and rum distilling, Barbados's industrial activity is partly aimed at the local market which produces goods such as tinned food, drinks, and cigarettes.

25|$|The Depression {{was a major}} blow to cigar manufacturers.

25|$|Beginning in the 1970s, several suburbs (banlieues) of Paris, (especially {{those in}} the north and east) {{experienced}} deindustrialisation, as factories closed or moved farther out. The once-thriving residential cités became ghettos for African and Arab immigrants with few skills and high unemployment. At the same time, some neighbourhoods within the city of Paris and the western and southern suburbs successfully shifted their economic base from <b>traditional</b> <b>manufacturing</b> to high-value-added services and high-tech manufacturing, giving these neighbourhoods the highest per-capita incomes in France and among the highest in Europe. The resulting widening economic gap between these two areas led to periodic clashes between young residents of the northeast housing projects and the police.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Wakefield {{declined}} {{in the last quarter}} of the 20thcentury as the coal mines and <b>traditional</b> <b>manufacturing</b> industries closed, contributing to high rates of unemployment. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015, 14.35% of the district's lower super-output areas were in the most deprived 10% of England. Employment grew by 12% between 1998 and 2003 as the economy recovered and enjoyed growth as the economic base of the district was diversified. Growth has been supported by inward investment from European and United Kingdom government funding which has impacted on the regeneration of the area. Manufacturing remains an important employment sector although the decline is projected to continue whilst distribution and the service industries are now among the main employers.|$|E

500|$|Hyderabad's role in {{the pearl}} trade has given it the name [...] "City of Pearls" [...] and up until the 18th century, the city was the only global trading centre for Diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Industrialisation began under the Nizams in the late 19th century, helped by railway {{expansion}} that connected the city with major ports. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Indian enterprises, such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Electronics (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and Andhra Bank (AB) were established in the city. The city is home to Hyderabad Securities formerly known as Hyderabad Stock Exchange (HSE), and houses the regional office of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In 2013, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) facility in Hyderabad was forecast to provide operations and transactions services to BSE-Mumbai {{by the end of}} 2014. The growth of the financial services sector has helped Hyderabad evolve from a <b>traditional</b> <b>manufacturing</b> city to a cosmopolitan industrial service centre. Since the 1990s, the growth of information technology (IT), IT-enabled services (ITES), insurance and financial institutions has expanded the service sector, and these primary economic activities have boosted the ancillary sectors of trade and commerce, transport, storage, communication, real estate and retail.|$|E

40|$|Large {{regional}} differences exist in female participation across regions within Japan. This paper uses two datasets {{to show that}} a significant convergence in female participation occurred from 1940 to 2010. Historically, female participation has been low in urban areas and high in non-urban areas. The participation rate steadily and significantly increased in urban areas and, to a lesser extent in non-urban areas, and thus {{regional differences}} shrank over time. Microdata from 1982 to 2012 reveal that regional dispersion is large for married women’s regular full-time participation in the <b>traditional</b> sectors (<b>manufacturing</b> for the less educated and teaching for the highly educated). Compositional changes in demographics and educational attainment explain 74 percent of the convergence for those aged 25 - 39 years, and 40 percent of the convergence for those aged 40 - 54 years. An increase in non-regular employment accounts for 60 percent of the convergence for the latter group. Convergence in regular full-time participation by married women is only observed in the <b>traditional</b> sectors (<b>manufacturing</b> and teaching) and not in the new sectors (service and retail). Since the compositional change is the major source of convergence for young women's participation, their behavior across regions did not converge...|$|R
