Remedial work took several months, but the aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed, on 17 July 1761. It remained in use for more than 100 years, until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893, replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct.|$|E

Bamber's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved. He sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> and had to be supported by his girlfriend. Several family members and friends alleged that, later at the wake, he was smiling and joking.|$|E
5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating <b>to</b> <b>buckle.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of 1 November, a combat patrol from the US 5th Cavalry Regiment, rear guard of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, was intercepted by PVA 343rd Regiment of the 115th Division at Bugle Hill. With the trap discovered, the Chinese immediately launched their attacks at 17:00. Supported by rocket artillery, the 117th Division attacked the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment in full force while four Chinese battalions from the 116th Division struck {{the gap between the}} 1st and 2nd Battalions of the US 8th Cavalry Regiment. By 23:00, the heavy fighting destroyed the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment while the US 1st and 2nd Battalions were running out of ammunition. As the UN forces began <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> around Unsan, Milburn finally ordered the garrison to withdraw after learning the destruction of the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the right flank.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} formations {{from which}} Silver Reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long, longitudinally aligned sections of Navajo Sandstone <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> and {{stand on their}} sides, giving them the appearance of ocean reefs. Over {{long periods of time}} silver ore, sediments, and vegetation were carried in water runoff from the Chinle Formation to the White, Buckeye, and East reefs. The ore settled as deposits and the vegetation became petrified. The Silver Reef Mining District's geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits, with smaller deposits of copper, gold, lead, and uranium oxide. Iron oxide deposits in the soil rocks cause a red coloration, and dinosaur tracks from the early Jurassic period have been found in the area.|$|E

5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before {{she was ready to}} be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for an hour on the slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E

While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both head toward the house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning <b>to</b> <b>buckle,</b> Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E

25|$|When a {{structure}} {{is subjected to}} compressive stress, buckling may occur. Buckling {{is characterized by a}} sudden sideways deflection of a structural member. This may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed. As an applied load is increased on a member, such as a column, it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have buckled. Further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member's load-carrying capacity. If the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it <b>to</b> <b>buckle.</b> If the buckled member {{is part of a larger}} assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member <b>to</b> <b>buckle</b> will be redistributed within the structure.|$|E
40|$|Published in Clinical Anatomy, 2005; 19 (1) : 12 - 18 at www. interscience. wiley. comThe {{need for}} {{improved}} mechanistic understanding of cancellous bone failure {{is at the}} core of important clinical problems such as osteoporosis, as well as basic biological issues such as bone formation and adaptation. Three-dimensional (3 D) anaglyphs were produced from 15 T 12 and L 1 vertebral bodies, which encompass the adult life span in both sexes. The anaglyphs were viewed with red-green stereo glasses, using an image analyzer, and trabecular thickness and trabecular length were measured. From biomechanical principles, the strength of individual trabeculae can be estimated from measurement of trabecular rod thickness and trabecular rod length as the load <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> index. The distribution of the load <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> index was best described by a log normal curve. Trabecular rod thickness, trabecular rod length, and load <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> index for males were consistently greater than for females. With aging, trabecular rod thickness, and the load <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> index decrease for males while trabecular rod length increases for females. In this study, the load <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> index for thoraco-lumbar vertebral trabecular rods potentially quantifies a greater risk of vertebral fracture for females. Decreased trabecular rod thickness or increased trabecular rod length result in the strength of trabeculae shifting closer to a putative fracture threshold. The corollary being that there is a reduced safety margin for resistance to mechanical loads for the vertebral bodies. The 3 D anaglyph technique for measuring trabecular dimensions provides an accurate and precise methodology by which these morphological studies can be undertaken. Peter Sutton-Smith, Ian H. Parkinson, Andrew M. J. Linn, Simone A. Kooke and Nicola L. Fazzalar...|$|R

5000|$|The hollow {{design of}} bird bones is {{multifunctional}} by establishing high specific strength and supplementing open airways {{to accommodate the}} skeletal pneumaticity common to many birds. The specific strength and resistance <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> is optimized through their bone design that combines a thin, hard shell that encases a spongy core of trabeculae. The allometry of their trabeculae allows the skeleton to tolerate loads without significantly increasing the bone mass. The Red-Tailed Hawk optimizes its weight with a repeating pattern of V-shaped struts that give the bones the necessary lightweight and stiff characteristics. The inner network of trabeculae shifts mass away from the neutral axis, which ultimately increases the resistance <b>to</b> <b>buckling.</b>|$|R

25|$|Bitumen was the nemesis of {{many artists}} during the 19th century. Although widely {{used for a}} time, it {{ultimately}} proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas <b>to</b> <b>buckle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cell {{achieves}} {{its height}} {{in the water}} column by synthesising gas vesicles. As the cell rises up, it is able to increase its carbohydrate load through increased photosynthesis. Too high and the cell will suffer photobleaching and possible death, however, the carbohydrate produced during photosynthesis increases the cell's density, causing it to sink. The daily cycle of carbohydrate build-up from photosynthesis and carbohydrate catabolism during dark hours is enough to fine-tune the cell's position {{in the water column}}, bring it up toward the surface when its carbohydrate levels are low and it needs to photosynthesis, and allowing it to sink away from the harmful UV radiation when the cell's carbohydrate levels have been replenished.

40|$|When a {{strip of}} metal formed by cold rolling is examined, it is {{frequently}} found <b>to</b> contain <b>buckles.</b> If centre buckles occur, the strip {{is said to have}} a 'long centre' while edge buckles are usually attributed to 'long edges'. If the wavelength and amplitude of the buckles are large, the shape of the buckles will obviously depend on the configuration in which the strip is held. For example, we expect the pattern of buckles of a strip laid on a flat table to be different those of a strip suspended between two rollers and subjected to tension. It is observed in practice, however, that buckling occurs in some cases with a characteristic wavelength that is relatively robust to strip configuration. An understanding of buckling patterns is of considerable interest to manufacturers of strip, particularly as current trends are to produce thinner sheet which is consequently more prone <b>to</b> <b>buckling.</b> The specific question that BHP Coated Products Division asked the Study Group to consider was whether long centres and edges could give rise <b>to</b> <b>buckling</b> patterns with a robust characteristic frequency...|$|R
