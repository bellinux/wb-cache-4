500|$|A devout Catholic, and {{politically}} social democratic, Logiest decided {{early on to}} favour the Hutu in his decision making in the country. This was partly for security reasons, as Logiest claimed that the Hutu would continue the violence {{as long as the}} Tutsi remained in power, but he also strongly in favour of the revolution on democratic grounds; he saw it as the opportunity for the [...] "oppressed" [...] Hutu peasants to rise up against the Tutsi ruling class. He later wrote in his memoirs: [...] "Some among my assistants <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong in being so partial against the Tutsi and that I was leading Rwanda on a road towards democratisation whose end was distant and uncertain"; but he defended his actions, saying [...] "it was probably the desire to put down the morgue and expose the duplicity of a basically oppressive and unjust aristocracy". After Kigeli and UNAR's retaliation against the Hutu, Logiest and his troops prioritised the protection of Hutu leaders (including Gitera).|$|E
500|$|Both Hollywood trade {{publications}} were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted {{it to be}} a sleeper hit {{and called}} it [...] "outstanding," [...] while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it [...] "a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success." [...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "I have long <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw The Iron Giant." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies. Amid the positive reviews, a mildly negative review came from The Washington Post Stephen Hunter, who opined, [...] "The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why are you trying to be mean?" ...|$|E

500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing. And I was quite nervous and didn't really get into enjoying it until II." ...|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson was {{particularly}} {{pleased with the}} episode showing a different side of Scully and said, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great idea. I personally was going through a dark period at the time, and I wanted to explore Scully's dark side. For some reason, Glen and Jim were on the same wavelength that week. Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them I thought they were wrong. I don't think that what I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E

500|$|The album, {{released}} {{on the same}} day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK, but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's Grapefruit books. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of their Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: [...] "They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that... people might buy this." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol [...] "were on the [...] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{and a great}} number of amateurs. In late 2007, American singer-songwriter Marié Digby posted an {{acoustic}} cover of [...] "Gimme More" [...] along with a cover of Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] in her YouTube account. Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I could have done a karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from my living room, and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making fun of her. He explained, [...] "There have been a few folks who have misinterpreted what I was doing and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> somehow making fun of her, which really isn’t the case. I have such a place in my heart for Britney".|$|E

60|$|I, for my part, was {{thoughtful}} too; for, {{how best}} to check this growing change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful <b>thoughts.</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ashamed to tell him exactly how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> placed, and what I had come down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one.

2500|$|Warhol {{had this}} to say about the attack: [...] "Before I was shot, I always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more half-there than all-there—I always {{suspected}} that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television." ...|$|E
2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and {{on the back of}} it read [...] "Lone Wolf". [...] He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 July 2007, Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) {{inducted}} Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons {{into its}} Hall of Fame. Also inducted that year were Hoodoo Gurus, Marcia Hines, Frank Ifield, Radio Birdman and Brian Cadd. According to Camilleri, [...] "I always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the weak {{link in the}} band, that I wasn't {{good enough to be}} in it. I had some great moments, moments that I didn't deserve, and was just happy to tag along". Prior to the induction, Camilleri said [...] "I'm chuffed. I think the Falcons did play a part in the Australian music explosion ... I'm happy it's been acknowledged. The Falcons were a band out of time. What we played wasn't what was being played. It was an R/reggae sound in the time of flares and funk and pop music. Somehow we slotted in." [...] At the induction ceremony, Mark Seymour declared that Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons were an inspiration for the formation of his band, Hunters & Collectors. For Young, it was his second induction in a row, his 2006 entry was as a member of Daddy Cool.|$|E
2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
