40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{effective}} orthogonal cutting edge in turning is considered. The orientation of this edge in the radial-longitudinal plane, as commonly modeled through an effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle,</b> is studied. The methods <b>of</b> effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> prediction used in numerous previously developed force models are plagued with large errors over ranges of process inputs, in particular feed rate and depth of cut. Four previously developed methods <b>of</b> effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> prediction are reviewed and compared to a new method presented here. This new method accounts for the size effect as introduced through the variation in chip thickness along the cutting edge, especially along the tool nose region. The difference in the new method is {{that the effect of}} continuous chip thickness variation along the cutting edge is included when evaluating the specific machining energies rather than using an average chip thickness, which has been used in the other methods. Therefore, the differential normal and friction force components acting on the rake face are functions of chip thickness through both the elemental chip load and the specific energies. Their directions are characterized by the orientations of the rake face and edge. By numerically integrating the differential force components modeled in this fashion, a significant improvement in effective <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> prediction accuracy is realized. This improved accuracy is verified using experimental data obtained for 1018 steel and 304 stainless steel at varying levels of feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed, nose radius and tool <b>lead</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

The influence <b>of</b> the <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the nozzle on the jetting of liquid metal gallium (Ga) was investigated. It {{was found that}} the Lorentz force component parallel to the nozzle that jets the electrified liquid Ga is always larger than its internal friction; thus, jet can be generated with any <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> but with different kinetic energies. Experimental results show that the mass of the jetting liquid, the jetting distance, the initial velocity of the jet, and the resulting kinetic energy of the jet increase first and then decrease. When the <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> is 90 °, the mass of the jetting liquid and the kinetic energy are at their maximum. When the angle is 80 °, the initial velocity achieves its maximum, with a calculated value of 0. 042 m/s. Moreover, very close and comparatively high kinetic energies are obtained at 80 ° and 90 °, indicating that angles in between this range can produce a preferable performance.

40|$|Surface quality {{influences}} the objects performance in fields like wear, friction and assembly. All these factors {{can affect the}} quality of products considerably. Traditional contact or non-contact measuring methods such as stylus, SEM and AFM etc have been widely used in surface measurement for years. Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages of these instruments. For example, stylus has a finite radius, and therefore may not be precise. Furthermore, it may cause scratch on the surface. SEM and AFM instruments are costly. In this thesis, a cost effective, high precision optical measurement system is developed for multiple applications. This precision instrument is leveraged on commercially available CD/DVD pickup head. The measurement results show that our system has a few advantages over the conventional stylus instrument. The focused laser spot is less than 1 micron in diameter, while the standard Profilometer has a finite stylus tip of 10 microns in diameter. Furthermore our system is a non-contact measurement technique which would not cause mechanical distortion of the measurement and would not damage the sample. Due to these differences, the measurement of standard Profilometer may not give the precise measurement results. Measurement has been made on a milled aluminium sample. There is 6 - 7 X difference between the standard Profilometer and our system. Convolution analysis about 3 X of the discrepancy is due to the difference in the sizes of the profiling mechanism. The remaining 2 X may due to the mechanical deformation of the stylus on the measured surface. Therefore, our system can indeed be 6 - 7 X more accurate than the conventional Profilometer which is widely used in industry. The second application is for 3 -D Profile Measurement. With the 3 dimensional PZT Actuators, objects with profile in millimetres can be measured precisely by non contact method. In comparison with the standard CMM machine, our system is low in cost. However, our system can only measure geometry of shallow features. Therefore it is not a replacement of more generally used CMM machine. The proposed multi-purpose system can also be applied to the <b>Lead</b> <b>Angle</b> Measurement. The <b>lead</b> <b>angle</b> appears during the finishing of contact surface of rotary shaft, which may lead to early leakage or dry run. The precision of our optical system for <b>Lead</b> <b>Angle</b> is around a few hundredth of a degree.

Steel is the cheapest alternative to lead. However, some hunters do not like its shooting properties, as steel is significantly less dense than lead. Therefore, its effective range is decreased due to rapidly decreasing velocity of the shot: thirty to forty yards is considered its maximum effective range for duck hunting. Many companies have improved steel shot by increasing muzzle-velocity, by using fast burning powder such as rifle powder thus making more consistent 'shot' or pellet patterns. Steel shot now travels at 1400 to 1500 feet per second. However, any use of steel shot requires a shotgun barrel with thicker walls and a specially-hardened bore, resulting in a heavier gun.|$|R

Under up-milling condition, the machined surface hardness with regard to various tilt angles are larger than the ones under corresponding <b>lead</b> <b>angles,</b> and the variations of surface hardness with increasing <b>lead</b> <b>angles</b> are not apparent. In down-milling condition, double-peaks shape appears in the changing curve of surface hardness with increasing tilt and <b>lead</b> <b>angles.</b> The residual stresses present the overall trend of firstly increasing, then decreasing, and finally increasing with the increasing tilt angle from - 45 to 45 degrees.
