Prorjeda je imala selektivan karakter, odnosno izdvojena je grupa tzv. perspektivnih stabala u broju koji odgovara prosječnom razmaku od 8, 5 × 8, 5 m i uklonjeni su njihovi izraziti konkurenti. Uzgojno neperspektivna stabla i stabla zaostala u rastu, što je uglavnom posljedica naknadnih popunjavanja, također su uklonjena. Prorjedom su uklonjena 122 stabla po hektaru (46 %), 6, 45 m 2 /ha (43 %), 66, 08 m 3 /ha (42 %) i 2645 m 2 /ha (40 %) površine projekcije krošnje, što je jačina zahvata iznad tzv. kritične temeljnice. Sortimentna struktura prorjednog etata pri selektivnoj prorjedi povoljnija je od shematskih prorjeda u mlađim nasadima na povoljnijim staništima i daje 50 % tehničkog drva, 30 % celuloznog drva i 20 % otpatka. Nakon 5 godina na prorijeđenoj je površini srednji promjer po temeljnici veći za 10, 6 %, volumen srednjeg stabla veći je za 21, 9 %, a površina projekcije krošnje srednjeg stabla veća je za 59, 0 % u odnosu na neprorijeđenu površinu. Nasuprot tomu, srednja visina po Loraju na prorijeđenoj je površini za 4, 2 % manja u odnosu na neprorijeđenu površinu. Veći tečajni prirast promjera, volumena i površine projekcije krošnje stabala na prorijeđenoj površini ukazuje na mogućnost produžetka ophodnje i povoljniju sortimentnu strukturu u odnosu na kontrolnu površinu. Research was {{conducted}} in the experiment plot of euramerican poplar, clone I- 214, which was founded with one year seedling type 1 / 1 with spacing 6 × 6 m in the square system on the alluvial soils of river Sava basin in which browning processes is expressed. Eleven years after the plantation establishment 3 blocks with two experimental plot of 0. 2016 ha, which are separated by a so-called. protective order, were singled out. In the experimental plot all the trees were numbered and measured by two cross-dbh, with an accuracy of 1 mm, and height, with an accuracy of 1 dm. The crown projection radius of 8 positions, each rotated to 45 o, were measured. On the three experimental plots (one in each block) selective thinning was carried out (PP-E), at which in each plots 50 % of trees were cut down, or {{the distance between the}} trees raised on average 8. 5 × 8. 5 m. Firstly, a collective called. promising trees set aside, in the number that corresponds to an average distance of 8. 5 × 8. 5 m, and their main competitors were removed. The trees behind in development, which is mainly due to additional filling in plantations two years after planting, are also removed because they were judged as silvicutural non-perspective. The remaining three experimental plots were control (PP-K). In each repetition trees for dendrometric analysis were sampled, the dominant one (dg 20 %) and a mean tree which has mean quadratic diameter (dg). In the 16 thyears of plantation development diameters at breast height (dbh) and height of each tree were re-measured, sa well as crown projection radius. The development of mean and dominant trees showed that the investigated habitat is the medium favorable for the cultivation of the poplar clone I- 214. Current increment of diameter, height and volume in the 11 thyear was in the intensive phase, where volume increment has not yet culminated (Figure 1 – 3). As a suitable element of growth to determine the start of thinning operation on a biological point of view, can be ring width along the spindle tree. In the first five years the tree has had a full solitary growth, and from the seventh year there is a competitive relationship between trees in plantation, which is manifested by changing the ring width along the spindle tree (Figure 4 and 5). This means that before the seventh year thinning does not have any biological justification. Models 1 and 2 of volume tables, constructed measuring felled trees from <b>thinning</b> (<b>Table</b> 2), and which are the dependence of the volume of tree from diameter at breast height (model 1) and from the diameter at breast and height (model 2), proved to be equally good at calculating the volume per hectare in the 11 thyear and more convenient compared to other tables and models (Table 3). To calculate the volume in the 16 thyear two input volume tables can be successfully used (model 2), while the application of model 1 is limited at the 11 thyear. In the 11 th year at the experimental plot an average of 263 – 266 trees per hectare are found, which represents a survival rate of about 95 %. Total basal area averaged from 14. 70 to 14. 97 m 2 /ha, while volume was an average from 156. 67 to 157. 62 m 3 ·ha- 1. By applying the statistical t-test significant difference in the number of trees, basal area and volume per hectare was not determined within the experimental plots before applying the silvicultural treatments (Table 4). By applying thinning operation, 122 trees per hectare (46 %), 6. 45 m 2 /ha (43 %) of the total basal area, 66. 08 m 3 /ha (42 %) of the total volume and 2645 m 2 /ha (40 %) of the the crown projection area were removed, which represent a strong procedure and is located above the so-called. critical basal area (Table 4, 13). Size of allowable cut in the thinning of 66. 08 m 3 /ha was in the limits expected on the basis of previous research for the density of 278 trees per hectare and the habitat medium favorable for the development of poplar clone I- 214. However, the assortment structureof allowable cut is more favorable compared to thinning in younger plantations in the more favorable habitats and produces 50 % of technical wood, 30 % of pulpwood and 20 % of wastewood (Table 4, 9, 15). Between 11 and 16 years on both series of experimental plot the mortality of trees was not determined. Five years after application of thinning treatment {{a significant difference in the}} number of trees, basal area, volume and crown projection areas of trees per hectarewere determined between the experimental and control plots (Table 4). The significant difference in the mean diameters, heights and crown projection areas of the mean and the dominant trees (Table 5, 6), as well as between the diameter strucures (Figure 7) were also determined between investigated plots. For a period of 5 years after application of thinning operation at the experimental field current basal area and volume increment per hectare accounted 85 % of basal area increment and 75 % of volume increment of the control plots wich had the number of trees twice higher than experimental plots (Table 14). For five years of positive reactions to increase growing space of remaining trees on the experimental plots the size of the total basal area and volume of trees removed by thinning operation is not compensated: the total basal area and the volume per hectare amounted to 2 / 3, and the crown projection area amounted 87 % of the size of the control plot. The reaction of trees on experimental plot with thinning treatment for 5 years is great and is reflected in greater mean diameter by 10. 6 %, greater mean tree volume by 21. 9 % and increased the crown projection area by 59. 0 % compared to control plot. In contrast, the mean Lorey’s height at the experimental plot with thinning treatment decreased by 4. 2 % compared to control plot. This has contributed to the intensification of the current (average periodic) volume increment compared to the period before applying thinning operation. Greater assimilation apparatus of trees in the experimental plots with thinning tretament and higher current diameter and volume increment indicate the need to extend the production cycle at the best assortment structure compared to the control plot. The research results indicate the validity of efforts that the thinning operation in poplar plantations should be treated as a biological and an economic category. As a biological category the thinning operation contributes to accelerating the growth of the remaining phenotypically better established trees and achieve optimum production. As economic categories with thinning operation realized the previous crop, and it being understood that the assortment of allowable cut in the thinning cover cost cutting and the establishment of plantations with more trees. In this framework it is necessary to direct further research, because the poplar plantations,which are aimed to applying thinning operation, are flexible enough to allow adaptation to changing market conditions...|$|E

The {{purpose of this article}} was to present the imaging findings on 4 cases of mucoceles arising within surgically proven frontal intersinus septal cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the case material in our department of otolar-yngology since 2000 was made looking for cases of patients with surgically proven frontal intersinus septal cell mucoceles. Institutional review board approval for the review was obtained. Four cases were identified that also had CT and/or MR imaging studies. Examples of 4 additional classic frontal sinus mucoceles and 3 anterior ethmoid mucoceles were also identified for comparison. RESULTS: All 4 of the cases of frontal intersinus septal cell mucoceles had an expanded midline frontal sinus cell, which thinned the posterior and/or anterior frontal sinus tables. The classic frontal sinus mucoceles were either to the left or right side, and any <b>table</b> <b>thinning</b> was off midline. The ethmoid mucoceles were clearly centered below the frontal sinuses.

A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} commercial thinning on hydrology and water quality of a 28 -year old (in 2002) drained loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation watershed (D 3) using another adjacent watershed (D 1) as a control. A paired watershed approach was used with data from two periods (1988 - 90 and 2000 - 02) for calibration and data from 2002 - 07 as the treatment period. Both of these 25 ha watersheds are located in Carteret County, North Carolina. Results showed a consistent rise in water table elevations on D 3 compared to the control during the six months after 50 % <b>thinning.</b> The water <b>table</b> rise of 12. 6 cm on average decreased substantially by June 2007, indicating an increase in evapotranspiration caused by increased canopy closure. Similarly, flow rates increased immediately after thinning and decreased soon thereafter. Monthly outflows on thinned watershed were generally higher in the summer-fall months compared to the control. However, the total annual outflow from the treatment was lower than the control, except for the very wet years of 2003 with extremely high rainfall (> 2300 mm) and 2005, possibly indicating a hydrologic recovery due to canopy closure approximately three years after thinning. Thinning did not affect nutrient concentrations and loading rates, except for NO 3 -N and total P. The increases in both of these nutrients were minor compared to the values obtained from fertilization of these stands. Results of the study indicate thinning may have only a short term (up to three years) effect on hydrology and water quality of drained pine plantation...|$|R

Foram avaliadas as seguintes variáveis: massa (g), comprimento (mm), diâmetro (mm), esfericidade e cor das bagas; teor de sólidos solúveis (SST), acidez titulável (AT) e índice de maturação (SST/AT) do mosto; massa (g), comprimento (cm) e largura (cm) dos cachos; produção por planta (kg/planta) e a produtividade (t ha- 1). Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey a 5 %. Conclui-se que o raleio de bagas é uma prática obrigatória na uva Black Star para se obter frutas de qualidade. A operação deve ser realizada com a escova plástica na pré-floração. Na impossibilidade de executar ou finalizar esse tratamento, pode-se empregar a despenca de bagas do estádio fenológico de 3 - 6 mm até 11 - 15 mm de diâmetro, mas esta pratica reduz a produtividade. The thinning {{is one of}} {{the operations}} with higher requirement of manpower in the production of table grapes. This activity removes 60 - 70 % of the berries from each cluster, so that the remaining fruits grow in size and quality. In grapevine 'Italia' and its mutants, the thinning is done by passing a plastic brush along the inflorescence and the availability of skilled manpower trained is crucial for its perfect execution. The 'despenca' involves removing parts of clusters (rachis) is a simple and fast method of thinning. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the methods and timing to perform the berry <b>thinning</b> on new <b>table</b> grape 'Black Star' in the city of Marialva, PR. The vines were trained in an overhead trellis system, spaced at of 3, 0 x 4, 0 m, and the trial were carried out in two regular seasons (2012 and 2013). A randomized block design was used as a statistical model with five replications and five treatments: control; inflorescence thinning by plastic brush at five days before flowering; thinning when berries had 3 - 6 mm in diameter; thinning when berries had 7 - 10 mm in diameter; and thinning when berries had 11 - 15 mm in diameter. The following variables were evaluated: mass (g), length (mm) diameter (mm), sphericity and color of berries, total soluble solids (SST), titratable acidity (AT) and maturation index (SST/AT) of must, mass (g), length (cm) and width (cm) of clusters; yield (kg/plant) and yield (t ha- 1). The data were subjected to analysis of variance and the treatment means compared by Tukey test at 5 %. It was concluded that the berry thinning is a mandatory practice in 'Black Star' grapes for fruit quality. The operation should be performed using plastic brush in pre-flowering. The failure to execute or terminate this treatment, it is possible to employ the berry thinning from the developmental stage of 3 - 6 mm to 11 - 15 mm in diameter, but this practice reduces productivity...|$|R
40|$|MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) are micro machines, i. e. {{freestanding}} {{very small}} devices that can move. These devices are very fragile and {{very sensitive to}} the environment. Particles might damage them, oxidation of the MEMS changes their mass and affects their properties, changes in pressure of the environment will affect their functionality, etc. For this reason, MEMS have to be encapsulated on the wafer (before dicing into chips) in a hermetic cavity. This encapsulation or package should be such that the environment inside the cavity stays stable over the lifetime of the MEMS. However, hermetical MEMS encapsulation with long-term internal environment stability is often challenging, especially for thin film packages. Due to the very small volume (normally below 100 nL) inside the thin film packages, even very small amounts of a gas will significantly increase the pressure inside the package. Thin film packages hermeticity requirements demand for an ultra-fine leak rate below 1 × 10 - 15 mbar. l/sec. The standard He storage fine leak test used in industry, with its measurement sensitivity limited to 1 × 10 - 12 mbar. l/sec, is not sensitive enough to test such an ultra-fine leak, and a more sensitive method does not exist. For this reason, {{a lot of research}} is done on new methods that allow to measure the packaging hermeticity of MEMS thin film packages and the ultra-fine level leak rate testing. The object of this PhD is to develop a method that can measure the pressure and ultra-fine leak rate of wafer level thin film MEMS packages, and to understand the mechanisms that can contribute to any change of the atmosphere inside the SiGe MEMS thin film package through experiments with some supports by models. This includes studying of the outgassing from materials located inside the package, in-diffusion of gasses from the outside world and leakage of gasses from the interface between the package and substrate. In this thesis, we demonstrate a new systematical methodology to measure the package leakage rate and internal pressure by open/sealing the package with the focused-ion-beam (FIB). We demonstrate the methodology using the capacitance between cap and bottom of the package, using the curvature of the package cap, and using the resonance frequency of the cap. Especially the latter was shown to allow measuring the internal pressure with a very high sensitivity and to enable the measurement of an ultra-fine air leak rate below the order of 1 × 10 - 15 mbar. l/sec, highly outperforming the commonly used standard fine leak method. The methodology can be applied to various MEMS packages. As a case study, we applied the measurement method on two different real MEMS packages to test their hermeticity. It is also shown that the air leakage rate measurement can be accelerated by storing the packages in a higher pressure gas (3 bar N 2 for example). However, care has to be taken when testing the He leak rate, because He can leak in or out the package by both a leak path and by diffusion. We also report on a systematic study of the outgassing properties of typical materials used for imec’s polycrystalline silicon-germanium (poly-SiGe) -based MEMS platform with a thin film vacuum package. We studied the outgassing by the thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) method. Two different TDS techniques, atmospheric pressure ionization mass-spectrometry (APIMS) and ultra-high vacuum thermal desorption spectroscopy (UH-TDS), were used for this study. It is shown that the UH-TDS is more suitable for studying the outgassing properties of <b>thin</b> film materials. <b>Table</b> of Contents 1.

40|$|Summary This {{research}} work {{is based on}} the preparation of membranes from SPEEK with reduced fuel cross-over following two different approach: 1) the preparation of bilayer membranes from in-home sulfonated PEEK (Vitrex) and a thin layer of in-home prepared carbon molecular sieve (CMS) from polyimide (Matrimid 5218); 2) blending of SPEEK with polyimide polymers. In both ways, it was possible to decrease the fuel cross-over in both direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) without compromise on proton conductivity. In this {{research work}}, a SPEEK with 56 % sulfonation degree was prepared and then used for making polymeric membranes. The specific modifications made to SPEEK polymeric membranes can be summarized as follows: (1) CMS coated SPEEK bilayer membranes: The idea was to take advantage of molecular sieving effects of the CMS for the rejection of bigger fuel molecules from the fuel mixture (water/alcohols) during pervaporation, DMFC and DEFC tests. The CMS layer was prepared by pyrolysis at (500 °C- 1000 °C), under inert (N 2 gas) atmosphere, of a thin film prepared from a polyimide (Matrimid 5218) solution in chloroform. The complete pyrolysis to carbon was confirmed by FTIR-ATR analysis. CMS prepared at 800 °C for 8 hours were chosen for further characterization because of high water/alcohols selectivity and easily detached from the quartz glass without any damage to them. Based on the thickness of CMS layer resulted from polyimide solutions with different concentration (1 and 2 wt. %), two types of bilayer membranes (CMS/SPEEK) were prepared. i. 	 SPEEK coated with 180 nm CMS thick layer (from 1 wt. % solution) (CMS/SPEEK 1). ii. 	 SPEEK coated with 400 nm CMS thick layer (from 2 wt. % solution) (CMS/SPEEK 2). Another approach was the preparation of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) by the incorporation of platinum as catalyst into the CMS layer in order to take advantage of both fuel barrier and electron conducting properties of the CMS layer. In order to determine fuel-crossover through plain SPEEK and CMS/SPEEK bilayer membranes, pervaporation experiments were carried out with methanol solutions at different concentrations (5, 10 and 20 wt. %) as well pervaporation of ethanol, n-propanol and iso-propanol solutions each with different concentrations (5 and 10 wt. %) were also carried out to investigate the pore size of the <b>thin</b> CMS layer. <b>Table</b> 1 shows the pervaporation results using both methanol and ethanol solutions with the same concentration (5 wt. %) and the proton conductivity measured at 60 °C and 100 % relative humidity (R. H.). It can be seen that fuel cross-over through the CMS/SPEEK bilayer membranes is quite low as compared to plain SPEEK {{and at the same time}} the proton conductivity remains almost constant. These results highlight the fuel barrier properties of the CMS layer. Table 7. 1 : Methanol and Ethanol permeability at 55 °C and proton conductivity at 60 °C and 100 % R. H. Membrane 	CMS layer thickness (nm) 	P (10 - 10 Kg m s- 1 m- 2) 	Proton conductivity (mS cm- 1) 		MeOH	EtOH	 SPEEK	 0 	 28 	 19 	 34 CMS/SPEEK 1 	 180 	 18 	 8. 5 	 33 CMS/SPEEK 2 	 400 	 10 	 3. 1 	 35 (2) SPEEK/PI Blends membranes: The idea was to take advantage of hydrophobic property of polyimide by incorporating it into SPEEK matrix for rejection of alcohols/water mixture during pervaporation, DMFC and DEFC performances. Three types of homogeneous SPEEK/PI blends were prepared at high temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C and 130 °C) based on the amount of polyimide (Matrimid 5218) added to the blend solution using dimethyl sulfo-oxide (DMSO) as solvent. 	SPEEK/PI (90 / 10) 	SPEEK/PI (80 / 20) 	SPEEK/PI (70 / 30) It was observed that homogeneous membranes were obtained at casting temperatures higher than 110 °C independent of the PI concentration in the SPEEK/PI blend solution. The same solutions rendered non-homogeneous membranes when cast below this temperature. For further characterization, homogeneous membranes from the above mentioned SPEEK/PI blend solutions were prepared by casting the solution at 130 °C. The methanol and ethanol permeation through these membranes was determined by the pervaporation of methanol and ethanol solutions (5 wt % concentrations) at 55 °C (Table 2). Table 7. 2 : Methanol and Ethanol permeability at 55 °C and proton conductivity at 60 °C and 100 % R. H.

The proton conductivity (mS cm- 1) at 60 °C is also shown in Table 2. About the effect of the blend composition onto the proton conducting properties of the membranes, just a slight decrease of the proton conductivity has been observed when increasing the PI concentration. Other functional characterizations of all the CMS/SPEEK and SPEEK/PI membranes prepared in this work included water and mixture uptake, direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) performance tests. The morphology of the CMS/SPEEK and SPEEK/PI membranes (both homogeneous and non-homogeneous) was analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). While attenuated total reflectance (ATR-FTIR), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed for the SPEEK/PI blend membranes to analyse the homogeneity of these membranes as compared to the pure constituents (polyimide and SPEEK). Zusammenfassung: Brennstoffzellen, die auf der Direktmethanolbrennstoffzellen-Technologie (DMFC) basieren, sind interessant und zukunftsweisend für portable Geräte. Im Vergleich mit herkömmlichen Energiequellen weisen DMFC-Brennstoffzellen eine 10 -mal höhere Energieeffizienz als Lithium-Ionen-Batterien auf, arbeiten bei niedrigeren Temperaturen (60 – 120 °C), lassen sich kostengünstig erneuern und sind umweltfreundlich. Toshiba, Manhattan Scientific Inc., Smart Fuel Cell (Germany), Medis Technologies sowie zahlreiche weitere Unternehmen arbeiten an der Entwicklung von Mikrobrennstoffzellen auf Basis der DMFC-Technologie zur Anwendung in tragbaren Geräten wie Mobiltelefonen, Notebooks u. ä. Smart Fuel Cell (Germany) und EFOY (Energy for You) haben einen größeren DMFC-Brennstoffzellenstack für den Einsatz in Lkw, Wohnmobilen, Video- und Umweltüberwachungseinrichtungen entwickelt. Ein weiterer Vorteil ist, dass der Brennstoff (Methanol) innerhalb kürzester Zeit und auch während der Anwendung hinzu gegeben werden kann. In Direktethanolbrennstoffzellen (DEFC) kommt Ethanol anstelle des giftigen, leicht entzündbaren und instabilen Methanol, das einen starken Geruch hat und geringfügig süßer als Ethanol ist, zum Einsatz. Weltweit beschäftigen sich weitaus mehr Forschungsteams mit Direktethanolbrennstoffzellen (DEFC), weil Ethanol nicht giftig ist und eine höhere theoretische Energiedichte von (8 kW h Kg- 1) im Vergleich zu Methanol (6 kW k Kg- 1) aufweist. System und Design von Direktethanolbrennstoffzellen (DEFC) und Direktmethanolbrennstoffzellen (DMFC) sind in etwa gleich – allerdings ist für die Elektrooxidation von Ethanol ein effektiverer Katalysator erforderlich. In beiden Brennstoffzellenarten ist die Rolle der Membran dieselbe: sie wirkt als Trennschicht zwischen den beiden Elektroden, fungiert als Protonenleiter und gleichzeitig wirkt sie als Sperrschichtfolie für den Treibstoff. Als besonders geeignete lonen leitende Membran für PEMFC-, DMFC- and DEFC-Anwendungen hat sich eine Membran aus sulfoniertem PoIyetheretherketon (SPEEK) erwiesen. Wesentlicher Nachteil dieser Membran ist ihre Methanoldurchlässigkeit insbesondere bei höheren Methanolkonzentrationen, was zu einer Minderung der Leistungsfähigkeit führt. Es besteht in der Tat die Notwendigkeit an neuen und besseren Membranmaterialien, die gute Barriere-Eigenschaften für den Treibstoff, hohe Protonenleitfähigkeit sowie ausreichenden thermische und chemische Widerstandfähigkeit aufweisen. Die Aufgabe der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es, eine auf SPEEK-basierte Membran zu entwickeln, die eine verbesserte mechanische Stabilität und/oder ein wesentlich verbessertes Methanolrückhaltevermögen aufweist. Dafür werden zwei verschiedene Strategien verfolgt: 1) Herstellung von Doppelschichtmembranen aus SPEEK (die Protonleitende Schicht) und Kohlenstoffmolekularsiebe (CMS) (die trennaktive Schicht). In dieser Arbeit sind auch die Sulfonierung von kommerziell erhältlichen PEEK (Vitrex) sowie die Herstellung des CMS aus Polyimid (PI) (Matrimid 5218) eingeschlossen. 2) Herstellung von Blendmembranen aus SPEEK und PI. Eine Beschreibung der beiden Strategien kann wie folgt zusammengefasst werden: (1) CMS/SPEEK Doppelschichtmembranen: Das Konzept ist, die Vorteile der Trennungseigenschaften der CMS zur Verringerung der Alkoholdurchlässigkeit während DMFC- und DEFC-Tests nutzen zu können. Die CMS wurden durch Pyrolyse einer dünner Polyimid-Membran bei hohen Temperaturen (500 °C- 1000 °C) unter Inertgasatmosphäre (N 2) erhalten. Die so hergestellten CMS wurden danach mittels FTIR-Spektroskopie untersucht. Nach 8 Stunden Karbonisierung bei 800 °C wurde ein CMS mit einer hohen Wasser/Alkohol-Selektivität hergestellt, das für weitere Charakterisierungen und die Herstellung der Doppelsichtmembranen verwendet wurde. Aus PI-Chloroform-Lösungen mit zwei verschiedenen Konzentrationen wurden folgende Doppelschichtmembranen hergestellt: i. 	 Beschichtung einer 180 nm dicken CMS-Schicht, die aus einer 1 Gew. -% PI-Chloroform-Lösung hergestellt wurde, mit einer SPEEK-Schicht (CMS/SPEEK 1). ii. 	 Beschichtung einer 400 nm dicken CMS-Schicht, die aus einer 2 Gew. -% PI-Chloroform-Lösung hergestellt wurde, mit einer SPEEK-Schicht (CMS/SPEEK 2). Wegen ihrer elektrischen Leitfähigkeit und Trennungseigenschaften eigneten sich CMS für die Herstellung von Gasdiffusionselektroden; daher wurden auch mit Platin dotierten CMS (Pt-CMS/SPEEK) Membran-Elektroden-Einheiten hergestellt. Pervaporation Tests mit MeOH-Wasser (5 Gew. - %) und EtOH-Wasser (5 Gew. - %) Lösungen wurden durchgeführt um den Stofftransport durch die hergestellten Membranen zu bestimmen. Tabelle 1 zeigt, dass Methanol- und Ethanoldurchlässigkeit den CMS/SPEEK Membranen erheblich niedriger war als die der Ausgangsmembran (SPEEK), während kein negativer Einfluss auf die Protonenleitfähigkeit beobachtet wurde. Diese Ergebnisse heben die Brennstoff-Barriere-Eigenschaften der CMS-Schicht hervor...|$|R
40|$|On-board image guidance, such as cone-beam CT (CBCT) and kV/MV 2 D imaging, is {{essential}} in many radiation therapy procedures, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). These imaging techniques provide predominantly anatomical information for treatment planning and target localization. Recently, {{studies have shown that}} treatment planning based on functional and molecular information about the tumor and surrounding tissue could potentially improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy. However, current on-board imaging systems are limited in their functional and molecular imaging capability. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a candidate to achieve on-board functional and molecular imaging. Traditional SPECT systems typically take 20 minutes or more for a scan, which is too long for on-board imaging. A robotic multi-pinhole SPECT system was proposed in this dissertation to provide shorter imaging time by using a robotic arm to maneuver the multi-pinhole SPECT system around the patient in position for radiation therapy. A 49 -pinhole collimated SPECT detector and its shielding were designed and simulated in this work using the computer-aided design (CAD) software. The trajectories of robotic arm about the patient, treatment table and gantry in the radiation therapy room and several detector assemblies such as parallel holes, single pinhole and 49 pinholes collimated detector were investigated. The rail mounted system was designed to enable a full range of detector positions and orientations to various crucial treatment sites including head and torso, while avoiding collision with linear accelerator (LINAC), patient table and patient. An alignment method was developed in this work to calibrate the on-board robotic SPECT to the LINAC coordinate frame and to the coordinate frames of other on-board imaging systems such as CBCT. This alignment method utilizes line sources and one pinhole projection of these line sources. The model consists of multiple alignment parameters which maps line sources in 3 -dimensional (3 D) space to their 2 -dimensional (2 D) projections on the SPECT detector. Computer-simulation studies and experimental evaluations were performed as a function of number of line sources, Radon transform accuracy, finite line-source width, intrinsic camera resolution, Poisson noise and acquisition geometry. In computer-simulation studies, when there was no error in determining angles (α) and offsets (ρ) of the measured projections, the six alignment parameters (3 translational and 3 rotational) were estimated perfectly using three line sources. When angles (α) and offsets (ρ) were provided by Radon transform, the estimation accuracy was reduced. The estimation error was associated with rounding errors of Radon transform, finite line-source width, Poisson noise, number of line sources, intrinsic camera resolution and detector acquisition geometry. The estimation accuracy was significantly improved by using 4 line sources rather than 3 and also by using thinner line-source projections (obtained by better intrinsic detector resolution). With 5 line sources, median errors were 0. 2 mm for the detector translations, 0. 7 mm for the detector radius of rotation, and less than 0. 5 ° for detector rotation, tilt and twist. In experimental evaluations, average errors relative to a different, independent registration technique were about 1. 8 mm for detector translations, 1. 1 mm for the detector radius of rotation (ROR), 0. 5 ° and 0. 4 ° for detector rotation and tilt, respectively, and 1. 2 ° for detector twist. Simulation studies were performed to investigate the improvement of imaging sensitivity and accuracy of hot sphere localization for breast imaging of patients in prone position. A 3 D XCAT phantom was simulated in the prone position with nine hot spheres of 10 mm diameter added in the left breast. A no-treatment-table case and two commercial prone breast boards, 7 and 24 cm thick, were simulated. Different pinhole focal lengths were assessed for root-mean-square-error (RMSE). The pinhole focal lengths resulting in the lowest RMSE values were 12 cm, 18 cm and 21 cm for no <b>table,</b> <b>thin</b> board, and thick board, respectively. In both no <b>table</b> and <b>thin</b> board cases, all 9 hot spheres were easily visualized above background with 4 -minute scans utilizing the 49 -pinhole SPECT system while seven of nine hot spheres were visible with the thick board. In comparison with parallel-hole system, our 49 -pinhole system shows reduction in noise and bias under these simulation cases. These results correspond to smaller radii of rotation for no-table case and thinner prone board. Similarly, localization accuracy with the 49 -pinhole system was significantly better than with the parallel-hole system for both the thin and thick prone boards. Median localization errors for the 49 -pinhole system with the thin board were less than 3 mm for 5 of 9 hot spheres, and less than 6 mm for the other 4 hot spheres. Median localization errors of 49 -pinhole system with the thick board were less than 4 mm for 5 of 9 hot spheres, and less than 8 mm for the other 4 hot spheres. Besides prone breast imaging, respiratory-gated region-of-interest (ROI) imaging of lung tumor was also investigated. A simulation study was conducted on the potential of multi-pinhole, region-of-interest (ROI) SPECT to alleviate noise effects associated with respiratory-gated SPECT imaging of the thorax. Two 4 D XCAT digital phantoms were constructed, with either a 10 mm or 20 mm diameter tumor added in the right lung. The maximum diaphragm motion was 2 cm (for 10 mm tumor) or 4 cm (for 20 mm tumor) in superior-inferior direction and 1. 2 cm in anterior-posterior direction. Projections were simulated with a 4 -minute acquisition time (40 seconds per each of 6 gates) using either the ROI SPECT system (49 -pinhole) or reference single and dual conventional broad cross-section, parallel-hole collimated SPECT. The SPECT images were reconstructed using OSEM with up to 6 iterations. Images were evaluated as a function of gate by profiles, noise versus bias curves, and a numerical observer performing a forced-choice localization task. Even for the 20 mm tumor, the 49 -pinhole imaging ROI was found sufficient to encompass fully usual clinical ranges of diaphragm motion. Averaged over the 6 gates, noise at iteration 6 of 49 -pinhole ROI imaging (10. 9 µCi/ml) was approximately comparable to noise at iteration 2 of the two dual and single parallel-hole, broad cross-section systems (12. 4 µCi/ml and 13. 8 µCi/ml, respectively). Corresponding biases were much lower for the 49 -pinhole ROI system (3. 8 µCi/ml), versus 6. 2 µCi/ml and 6. 5 µCi/ml for the dual and single parallel-hole systems, respectively. Median localization errors averaged over 6 gates, for the 10 mm and 20 mm tumors respectively, were 1. 6 mm and 0. 5 mm using the ROI imaging system and 6. 6 mm and 2. 3 mm using the dual parallel-hole, broad cross-section system. The results demonstrate substantially improved imaging via ROI methods. One important application may be gated imaging of patients in position for radiation therapy. A robotic SPECT imaging system was constructed utilizing a gamma camera detector (Digirad 2020 tc) and a robot (KUKA KR 150 -L 110 robot). An imaging study was performed with a phantom (PET CT Phantom TM), which includes 5 spheres of 10, 13, 17, 22 and 28 mm in diameter. The phantom was placed on a flat-top couch. SPECT projections were acquired with a parallel-hole collimator and a single-pinhole collimator both without background in the phantom, and with background at 1 / 10 th the sphere activity concentration. The imaging trajectories of parallel-hole and pinhole collimated detectors spanned 180 degrees and 228 degrees respectively. The pinhole detector viewed a 14. 7 cm-diameter common volume which encompassed the 28 mm and 22 mm spheres. The common volume for parallel-hole was a 20. 8 -cm-diameter cylinder which encompassed all five spheres in the phantom. The maneuverability of the robotic system was tested by navigating the detector to trace the flat-top table while avoiding collision with the table and maintaining the closest possible proximity to the common volume. For image reconstruction, detector trajectories were described by radius-of-rotation and detector rotation angle &# 952;. These reconstruction parameters were obtained from the robot base and tool coordinates. The robotic SPECT system was able to maneuver the parallel-hole and pinhole collimated SPECT detectors in close proximity to the phantom, minimizing impact of the flat-top couch on detector to center-of-rotation (COR) distance. In no background case, all five spheres were visible in the reconstructed parallel-hole and pinhole images. In with background case, three spheres of 17, 22 and 28 mm diameter were readily observed with the parallel-hole imaging, and the targeted spheres (22 and 28 mm diameter) were readily observed in the pinhole ROI imaging. In conclusion, the proposed on-board robotic SPECT can be aligned to LINAC/CBCT with a single pinhole projection of the line-source phantom. Alignment parameters can be estimated using one pinhole projection of line sources. This alignment method may be important for multi-pinhole SPECT, where relative pinhole alignment may vary during rotation. For single pinhole and multi-pinhole SPECT imaging onboard radiation therapy machines, the method could provide alignment of SPECT coordinates with those of CBCT and the LINAC. In simulation studies of prone breast imaging and respiratory-gated lung imaging, the 49 -pinhole detector showed better tumor contrast recovery and localization in a 4 -minute scan compared to parallel-hole detector. On-board SPECT could be achieved by a robot maneuvering a SPECT detector about patients in position for radiation therapy on a flat-top couch. The robot inherent coordinate frames could be an effective means to estimate detector pose for use in SPECT image reconstruction. Dissertatio...|$|R
