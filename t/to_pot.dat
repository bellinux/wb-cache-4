5|$|Murphy {{began the}} 2012/2013 season ranked number six. The first tournament for Murphy was the Wuxi Classic, where he {{lost in the}} first round 1–5 against Ken Doherty. Murphy's next tournament was the Six-red World Championship, where he {{finished}} first in Group E with four wins out of five matches and advanced to the knock-out stage. There he defeated James Wattana, Barry Hawkins, Dominic Dale and Judd Trump to reach the final, but lost 4–8 against Mark Davis. He then reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Goldfields Open, but lost 4–5 against Peter Ebdon. Murphy gone one better in the next two ranking tournaments, as he reached the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters and the International Championship, but lost 3–6 against John Higgins and 5–9 against Neil Robertson respectively. Murphy than reached the final of the 2012 UK Championship courtesy of two tight victories. The first against teenager Luca Brecel in the quarter-finals, after Brecel twice had the chance <b>to</b> <b>pot</b> the final pink and black to win the match, then against Ali Carter in which Murphy recovered from 4–8 down and 0–32 in points behind in the deciding frame to win 9–8. He was ultimately defeated by good friend Mark Selby 10–6 in the final. He also participated at the Players Tour Championship, with his best result coming at the third English event, where he reached the semi-finals, but lost 0–4 against Marco Fu. He finished number 29 on the Order of Merit, and couldn't qualify to the Finals.|$|E

As defending champions, Spain were also automatically assigned <b>to</b> <b>Pot</b> 1, though their UEFA ranking {{at the time of the}} draw was coincidentally also the best.|$|E

It {{was here that}} silver was first {{discovered}} in 1833 by John Hunt, although there are earlier claims dating to 1817. Mining only took place for three years before Le Pot was abandoned due to flooding. The severe financial problems this caused almost resulted in the bankruptcy of the incumbent Seigneur, Ernest le Pelley. The Le Pelleys were obliged to transfer the fief to the Collings family, of whom the current Seigneur is a descendant. Remains of this mine can still be seen.|$|E

Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes <b>to</b> <b>pot!</b> So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|Described by Riley as the album's [...] "most {{derivative}} cut", [...] "Got to Get You into My Life" [...] {{was influenced}} by the Motown Sound and written by McCartney after he had seen Stevie Wonder perform at the Scotch of St James nightclub in February. The horn players on the track included members of Georgie Fame's group, the Blue Flames. To capture the desired sound, microphones were placed in the bells of the brass instruments, and the signals were heavily limited. A month later, a tape copy of these horn parts was superimposed with a slight delay, thereby doubling the presence of the brass contributions. Rodriguez terms the completed track [...] "an R shouter". Although cast {{in the form of a}} love song, McCartney described the lyric as [...] "an ode <b>to</b> <b>pot,</b> like someone else might write an ode to chocolate or a good claret". The initial version of the song, as issued on Anthology 2, featured acoustic backing and organ, and a harmonised refrain of [...] "I need your love", which was replaced by Harrison's guitar break on the more uptempo remake.|$|E

2500|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to score more [...] than one's opponent by potting [...] in the correct order. At the start of a frame, the balls are positioned as shown, and the players then take turns to hit shots by striking the cue ball with the [...] of the cue, their aim being <b>to</b> <b>pot</b> one of the red balls into a pocket and thereby score a point, or, if this is not possible, to at least hit a red ball so as to avoid making a foul shot. If the striker pots a red ball, he or she must then pot one of the six [...] "colours" [...] (in snooker, the term colour is understood to exclude the red balls). If the player successfully pots a colour, the value of that ball is added to the player's score, and the ball is returned to its starting position on the table. After that, the player must pot another red ball, then another colour, and so on. This process continues until the striker fails <b>to</b> <b>pot</b> the desired ball, at which point the opponent comes to the table to play the next shot.|$|E

2500|$|Snooker ( [...] , [...] ) is a cue sport which {{originated}} among British Army {{officers in}} Etawah, India {{in the latter}} half of the 19th century. It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth, or baize, with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue and 22 coloured balls, players must strike the white ball (or [...] "cue ball") <b>to</b> <b>pot</b> the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game, or frame, is won by the player who scores the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames.|$|E
2500|$|The {{total number}} of {{consecutive}} points (excluding fouls) that a player amasses during one [...] to the table {{is known as a}} [...] "". A player attaining a break of 15, for example, could have reached it by potting a red then a black, then a red then a pink, before failing <b>to</b> <b>pot</b> the next red. The traditional maximum break in snooker is achieved by potting all reds with blacks then all colours, yielding 147 points; this is often known as a [...] "147" [...] or a [...] "maximum". The highest possible break is a 155 break, also known as a [...] "super maximum". This is achieved via the opponent leaving a , with the black being potted as the additional colour, and then potting 15 reds and blacks with the colours. Jamie Cope has the distinction of being the first player in snooker history to post a verified 155 break, achieved in a practice frame in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|This {{stand by}} the [...] may have given Charles Edward Stuart {{the time to make}} his escape. At the time when the Macdonald regiments were {{crumbling}} and fleeing the field, Stuart seems to have been rallying Perth's and Glenbuchat's regiments when O'Sullivan rode up to Captain Shea who commanded Stuart's bodyguard: [...] "Yu see all is going <b>to</b> <b>pot.</b> Yu can be of no great succor, so before a general deroute wch will soon be, Seize upon the Prince & take him off...". Shea then led Stuart from the field along with Perth's and Glenbuchat's regiments. From this point on the fleeing Jacobite forces were split into two groups: the Lowland regiments retired in order southwards, making their way to Ruthven Barracks; the Highland regiments however were cut off by the government cavalry, and forced to retreat down the road to Inverness. The result was that they were a perfect target for the government dragoons. Major-general Humphrey Bland led the charge against the fleeing Highlanders, giving [...] "Quarter to None but about Fifty French Officers and Soldiers He picked up in his Pursuit".|$|E
2500|$|According to Jainism, causes are of {{two types}} – Upādanā kārana (substantial or {{material}} cause) and Nimitta kārana (instrumental cause). Upādanā kārana is always identical with its effect. For example, out of clay, {{you can only}} produce a clay pot; hence the clay is the upādanā kārana or material cause and clay pot its effect. Wherever the effect is present, the cause is present and vice versa. The effect is always present in latent form in the material cause. For transforming the clay <b>to</b> <b>pot,</b> the potter, the wheel, the stick and other operating agents are required that are merely nimitta or instrumental cause or catalysts in transformation. The material cause always remains the clay. Hence the cause and effect are always entirely identical in nature. [...] Potter cannot be the material cause of pot. If this were the case, then Potter might as well prepare the pot without any clay. But this is not so. Thus a clay pot can only be made from clay; gold ornaments can be made only from gold. Similarly the different modes of existence of a soul {{are a result of}} activities of soul itself. There cannot be any contradiction or exceptions.|$|E
2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} fine {{cut into the}} corner pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was saying to myself, don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able <b>to</b> <b>pot</b> a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, I would just say yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, making a joke about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although I lost the match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos. Both players now commentate on BBC's snooker coverage and are often reminded of that match. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E
