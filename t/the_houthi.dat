25|$|On 21 February, {{one month}} after Houthi militants {{confined}} Hadi to his residence in Sana'a, he {{slipped out of the}} capital and traveled to Aden.

50|$|In March 2013 the National Dialogue Conference was {{conceived}} as a core part of the transition process and is intended to bring together Yemen's diverse political and demographic groups to address critical issues. In January 2014, Hadi pushed delegates at the conference to break a deadlock on key issues and bring the talks to an overdue close. When those in attendance finally agreed on a final few points, he launched into an impassioned speech {{that led to a}} spike in his popularity. It was agreed that Yemen would shift to a federal model of government in the future, a move which have been proposed and forcefully backed by Hadi. For <b>the</b> <b>Houthi's</b> this decentralization was less attractive. Their mountainous region is the poorest of Yemen and decentralization would mean that it would receive less money from the central government. They also didn't like that the new regional borders would rob them of access to the sea.|$|R
25|$|On 9 October 2016, Mason, {{operating}} {{near the}} Bab-el-Mandeb strait, was targeted by two missiles fired from Houthi-controlled territory. Both missiles fell short {{and crashed into}} the water. <b>The</b> <b>Houthi</b> insurgency denied launching {{the attack on the}} warship. The United States Naval Institute reported that Mason fired two SM-2 Standard missiles and one RIM-162 ESSM missile to intercept the two missiles as well as deploying its Nulka missile decoy. One of two U.S. defense officials cited anonymously added that it was not clear whether the incoming missiles had been shot down or crashed into the water on their own. This marked the first recorded instance of ship-based missiles being fired from vertical launching cells in combat in response to an actual inbound missile threat.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March, {{after taking}} over Sana'a and the Yemeni government, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee {{declared}} a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and further their control by driving into southern provinces. <b>The</b> <b>Houthi</b> offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, {{began on the}} next day with fighting in Lahj governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government; Hadi fled the country the same day. Concurrently, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using airstrikes to restore the former Yemeni government and the United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the campaign. According to the UN and other sources, from March 2015 to November 2017, 8,670–10,000 {{people have been killed in}} Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians.|$|E
25|$|Ansar Allah (sometimes Anglicised as Ansarullah), known popularly as the Houthis, a Zaidi {{group with}} {{its origins in}} the mountainous Sa'dah Governorate on Yemen's {{northern}} border with Saudi Arabia, began waging a low-level insurgency against the Yemeni government in 2004. The intensity of the conflict waxed and waned {{over the course of}} the 2000s, with multiple peace agreements being negotiated and later disregarded. <b>The</b> <b>Houthi</b> insurgency heated up in 2009, briefly drawing in neighbouring Saudi Arabia on the side of the Yemeni government, but quieted the following year after a ceasefire was signed. During the early stages of the Yemeni Revolution in 2011, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared the group's support for demonstrations calling for the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Later in the year, as Saleh prepared to leave office, the Houthis laid siege to the Sunni-majority village of Dammaj in northern Yemen, a step toward attaining virtual autonomy for Sa'dah.|$|E

The tribesmen were also reinforced by weapons received via 200 vehicles from tribes in the nearby province of Abyan. After <b>the</b> fighting, <b>Houthi</b> positions were hit by Coalition air-strikes.|$|R
50|$|Both the Omani and Iranian governments {{said they}} welcomed {{the end of}} airstrikes. On 22 April, Oman {{presented}} a seven-point peace deal to both parties.

25|$|On 6 August, the UN {{special envoy}} to Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, {{announced}} the suspension in Kuwait, where the talks were being held. He said that the negotiations were not a failure {{and that they would}} resume in a month at an undisclosed location. Mr. Ahmed is the second United Nations envoy to try to broker peace talks between the Houthis and other factions in Yemen since March 2015. His predecessor quit after similar peace talk efforts failed. After the breakdown of the talks, one of <b>the</b> <b>Houthi</b> negotiators, Nasser Bagazgooz, blamed the United Nations envoy for seeking what he said amounted to a military solution on behalf of the Saudi-led coalition. Previous negotiations floated the idea of forming a unity government — composed of Houthi and former Hadi government leaders. But the exiled Hadi leaders have consistently rejected any deal that would diminish their power over Yemen, and the Houthis have said that they will reject any deal that does not give them a seat at the table.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the civil war, many of Somalia's residents left in search of asylum. According to the UNHCR, there were around 975,951 registered refugees from the country in neighboring states as of 2016. Additionally, 1.1 million people were internally displaced persons (IDPs). The majority of the IDPs were Bantus and other ethnic minorities originating from the southern regions, including those displaced in the north. An estimated 60% of the IDPs were children. Causes of the displacement included armed violence, periodic droughts, and other natural disasters, which, along with diverted aid flows, hindered the IDPs' access to safe shelter and resources. IDP settlements were concentrated in south-central Somalia (893,000), followed by the northern Puntland (129,000) and Somaliland (84,000) regions. Additionally, there were around 9,356 registered refugees and 11,157 registered asylum seekers in Somalia. Most of these foreign nationals emigrated from Yemen to northern Somalia after <b>the</b> <b>Houthi</b> insurgency in 2015. However, the majority of emigrants to Somalia consist of Somali expatriates, who have returned to Mogadishu and other urban areas for investment opportunities and {{to take part in the}} ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process.|$|E
