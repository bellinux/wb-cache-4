40|$|Convergence has {{blurred the}} {{artificial}} limits that traditionally existed between separated sectors and services. In particular, technological convergence united cable and telephone networks as convenient platforms for {{the provision of}} numerous new telecommunications services. The advent of the Internet and the development of other services started a race for the acquisition of broadband transmission that has, in part, prompted a number of corporate mergers between the major telephone, cable, and Internet service providers. This thesis analyzes the legal implications of the convergence of cable operators and telephone carriers in the United States of America (U. S.). The analysis was conducted in light of the 1996 <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Act's</b> provisions, the Federal Communications Commission's reports and orders, and under the critical approaches of the cable and telephone industries. This thesis presents recommendations addressed to promote an equal regulatory treatment for all telecommunications competitors in the U. S...|$|R
25|$|On 19 July 1982, the Government {{formally}} {{announced its}} intention to privatise British Telecommunications with the sale of up to 51% of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by {{the passing of the}} <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Act</b> 1984, which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecommunications, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, on 20 November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecommunications shares were sold to the public. At the time, this was the largest share issue in the world.|$|E

She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative.

She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Act</b> of 1996.

25|$|The British <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Act</b> 1981 {{transferred}} {{the responsibility for}} telecommunications services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, Post Office Ltd. and British Telecommunications. At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecommunications, to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the British Standards Institution (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and {{had the effect of}} requiring British Telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable & Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary, Mercury Communications Ltd.|$|E

By law, the Confederation is the majority shareholder of the leading telecommunications company Swisscom, a former public monopoly provider (Art. 6 <b>Telecommunications</b> Enterprise <b>Act).</b> Both {{the fact that there}} is a dominant firm in all market segments (fixed, mobile, internet), and the role of the state in the sector contribute to the STRI value.|$|R
