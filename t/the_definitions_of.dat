5|$|In October 2011, at the 24th CGPM {{proposals}} {{were made to}} change <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> four of the base units. These changes should not affect the average person.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this change {{is that the new}} definition makes the definition of the kelvin depend on <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the second, the metre, and the kilogram.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> {{cultural}} science depends on <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> creative industries. <b>The</b> problem, however, is that unlike <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary economics, complexity science and new cultural studies, {{which are also}} elements of cultural science, the creative industries suffer multiple non-commensurable definitions.

5|$|These {{changes will}} {{have the effect of}} redefining the SI base units, though <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the derived SI units in terms of the base units will remain the same.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{variants}} of the metric system evolved, all using the Mètre des Archives and Kilogramme des Archives (or their descendants) as their base units, but differing in <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the various derived units.|$|E
5|$|At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM {{recommended}} that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could then be used in <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> units of measure {{in place of the}} IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.|$|E
30|$|We next give <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> G-compatible {{mappings}} {{inspired by}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> compatible mappings in [13].|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coend of a functor [...] is <b>the</b> dual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> an end.|$|R
5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas comments on <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> femininity and masculinity {{in the early}} nineteenth century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the unbounded accumulation of wealth.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography. While the Supreme Court has generally refused to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment, pornography is subject to little regulation. However, <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> obscenity and pornography have changed over time.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Eastern Bloc ceased to exist; with it, so did all {{applicability}} of the term Second World. <b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the First World and Third World changed slightly, yet generally described the same concepts.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E
