25|$|In April 1977 {{a patient}} from Harborview Medical Center known as Maria {{claimed to have}} {{experienced}} an out-of-body experience. During her OBE she claimed to have floated outside her body {{and outside of the}} hospital. Maria would later tell her social worker Kimberly Clark that during the OBE she had observed a <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> on the third floor window ledge to {{the north side of the}} building. Clark would go to the north wing of the building and by looking out of the window could see a <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> on one of the ledges. Clark published the account in 1985. The story has since been used in many paranormal books as evidence a spirit can leave the body.|$|E
500|$|Initially police {{believed}} that the murder was a drive-by shooting, but investigators discovered a <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> print near the outdoor air conditioning unit, and a yellow business card next to Fischer's body. Though the business card was stained by blood from Corinne's hands after she {{tried to stop the}} bleeding, investigators were able to decipher the wording on the card. It was from the Collin County bail office in McKinney, Texas. A [...] phone number was printed on the card and it had a handwritten area code, 214, from the Dallas area. Alex Perez, the former sheriff of Cameron County, who was appointed to lead the investigation, called the bail office and asked them to fax copies of bond applications made by Rio Grande Valley residents. The police theorized that the assailant had dropped the card after Fischer tried to defend himself. The bail office faxed the police several applications, and included one from Rudy Cuellar, a Dallas resident who often visited Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Footwear {{such as a}} <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> or a hiking boot is {{considered}} inappropriate for riding both because the shoe {{has little or no}} raised heel and because the heavy tread that provides traction for athletic endeavors can cause the foot to catch in the stirrup and become trapped. [...] Modern synthetic materials have allowed the design of riding boots that will slide from a stirrup but are also comfortable for walking, with a sole using varying hard and soft materials that provides reasonable traction with a minimal amount of raised tread.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, Hayden Ebbern, Sean Mulligan and Barry Beyerstein {{visited the}} Medical Center to {{investigate}} the story. They placed a <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> on the same ledge and discovered that the shoe was visible from within the building and could have easily been observed by a patient lying in bed. They also discovered the shoe was easily observable from outside the building and suggested that Maria may have overheard a comment about it during her three {{days in the hospital}} and incorporated it into her OBE. They concluded [...] "Maria's story merely reveals the naiveté and the power of wishful thinking" [...] from OBE researchers seeking a paranormal explanation. Clark did not publish the description of the case until seven years after it happened, casting doubt on the story. Richard Wiseman has said that although the story is not evidence for anything paranormal it has been [...] "endlessly repeated by writers who either couldn’t be bothered to check the facts, or were unwilling to present their readers with the more skeptical side of the story." ...|$|E

The upper part of the shoe is made of white leather, whereas the pimpled outer sole is made of rubber. The inner sole is made of synthetic material. It was Horst Dassler, the son of Adolf [...] "Adi" [...] Dassler - the founder of Adidas, who had the idea of the first leather <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe.</b> In 1965, this <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> model was named the [...] "adidas Robert Haillet" [...] after the French tennis professional Robert Haillet. When Haillet retired from tennis, Adidas and Horst Dassler decided to find another tennis player that could endorse the <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> model. Donald Dell, an American tennis manager, suggested Stan Smith, who took the offer in order to obtain royalties for the use of his name. For Adidas, the shoe became a market opener in the United States. In 1967, a green foam padding was added {{at the back of the}} shoe for Achilles tendon protection.|$|E
