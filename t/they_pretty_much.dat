500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> can't show Walt ever again". Wizards Nikki Stafford {{went so far as to}} remark that [...] "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role." ...|$|E

Despite the Creatures' concerns over how the Yankees management would handle the move, Lewis said that, [...] "The Yankees helped us because I calmed everybody down over the years.

But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots.
