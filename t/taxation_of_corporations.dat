40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{corporate}} tax system {{within the context}} of the historical bias and current effects of the current system of <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations</b> and shareholders. Drawing on public finance theory, financial markets microstructure research, and perspectives on corporate governance, Professor Rudnick proposes a profits tax on the liquid equity of firms. She finds this to be a normative rationale for a double tax system under optimal tax principles due to the inelasticity of demand for and supply of liquidity and the economic rent it produces. The value of liquidity in different capital markets is the crucial determinate. Under traditional tax policy criteria of horizontal and vertical equity and efficiency, this approach correctly classifies those firms that can normatively be included in a double tax system after an interest return on equity is deducted. Drawing the line at liquidity allows the fullest expansion of passthrough regimes such as Subchapter S and partnership taxation as well as other forms of integration...|$|E

Direct income-related taxes have a direct impact on profit of the companies. It is corporate income tax which can significantly affect business in a single market because capital, unlike labour, is a highly mobile factor that can flexibly move to countries with favourable tax treatment. The difference in corporate tax causes economic distortions; it affects businesses when deciding on placement and investment financing. The thesis is composed of nine chapters. The first chapter briefly examines harmonization process of direct taxes in the European Union. The chapter one consists of three subchapters. The first subchapter investigates the differences between tax harmonization and tax coordination. In second subchapter I am dealing with European directives which have direct impact on the direct-related taxes in the European Union. The third subchapter focuses on [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} corporate residence" with particular reference to {{the law in the}} UK and Canada. It explores why corporate residence is relevant in tax policy, how corporate residence is understood in law, and how revenue authorities respond to the use and alleged 'abuse' of residence rules. Part I argues that the residence of taxpayers generally (individual or corporate) remains a relevant factor in international tax design, that <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations</b> on the basis of residence has some justification, but that there is a disjunction between meaningful residence-based taxation and current definitions of corporate residence in domestic law and tax treaties. The formulations of residence based on incorporation, central management and control, and place of effective management, particularly as applied to multinational enterprises, are considered and are found to be deficient. Part II critically {{analyzes the}} major policy responses of the UK and Canadian governments to the exploitation of corporate residence. It argues that key legislative and administrative responses to international tax avoidance activities, for both outbound and inbound investment, are purportedly based on the acceptance of formal corporate residence yet undermine that concept in an effort to impose tax or refuse treaty relief based on where economic interests actually exist. The responses considered are the application of controlled foreign companies legislation to offshore subsidiaries, the invocation of treaty anti-abuse rules with respect to offshore intermediaries, and the use of overarching general anti-avoidance measures to challenge varied structures that rely on offshore entities. These haphazard anti-avoidance rules are overlaid with revenue authorities' indignation at the motivations that underlie many corporate relocations. It is argued that a more coherent approach would be to focus on the objective reality or unreality of corporate establishment, by reformulating corporate residence in domestic law and tax treaties.

40|$|Globalization and {{integration}} of markets gradually weaken not only the actual boundaries between states, but also tax limits. The growing interconnect-edness of national economies and markets causes tax competition, which may be advantageous for some states, but for others {{it may be a}} threat to undermine public budgets. While tax competition generally increases efficiency, it may also have undesirable consequences that may lead to a race to the bottom. Also, differences in the taxation of capital in different countries mean that there are capital shifts to the tax-favourable jurisdictions for the purpose of tax avoidance in the home country. The question therefore arises as to whether tax competition is not an obstacle to effective <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations,</b> and whether and how governments should counter threats to undermine public finances. While some require mutual cooperation in the coordination and harmonization of direct taxation in the European Union, others argue that the most effective solution is market allocation and acceptance of tax competition. Opinion is divided over whether to maintain or remove tax competition and this leads to a discussion of whether it is really beneficial or harmful. The aim of the dissertation is to answer this question. The dissertation empirically evaluates the level of tax competition in the European Union and using panel analysis it verifies on a sample of 27 Member States over the period 1998 to 2010 that tax competition is not harmful, it does not lead to impoverished public budgets and to a race to the bottom in the EU- 15. It also comes {{to the conclusion that the}} new EU- 12 states do not cause harmful tax competition with the original EU- 15 states. In connection with this the dissertation also focuses on the need to protect the tax bases of individual states. It deals with economic aspects of general and specific anti-abuse rules in national tax systems of the Member States and verifies why, in addition to general rules, states should implement specific measures in the form of CFC rules to defend themselves against tax evasion and tax avoidance...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations,</b> the State of California employs {{an income}} tax method that {{utilizes}} the 2 ̆ 2 unitary-business 2 ̆ 2 doctrine and three-factor formula apportionment. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, Container Corporation of America contested the application of California 2 ̆ 7 s taxation method on three grounds. First, it disputed the finding of a unitary-business consisting of itself and its foreign subsidiaries; second, it claimed that even if a unitary-business did exist, differences in international economic conditions caused a distortion of income when the apportionment method was applied, which warranted rejection of the worldwide income apportionment; and third, it claimed that states 2 ̆ 7 use of the unitary-business concept across national boundaries and the apportionment of worldwide income violated the foreign commerce clause because the method resulted in double taxation and violated federal uniformity in the international sphere. This article examines the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s holding {{on each of these}} three contested issues. First is an examination of the fundamental principles of the unitary-business determination, including a discussion of the constitutional restraints placed upon states using the unitary-business method and the discretion allowed by the Supreme Court in unitary-business determinations made by state courts. Second is an examination of the distortion of income produced when the unitary-business/formula apportionment method is applied despite differences in international economic conditions and the amount of income distortion the Court appears willing to accept. Finally is an examination of the foreign commerce clause considerations of double taxation and federal uniformity in the international sphere. The analysis of the double taxation issue includes a discussion of the level of scrutiny applied by the Court in cases of international double taxation. The federal uniformity analysis includes an examination of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s tests for determining state violation of federal uniformity and will apply those tests to the facts presented by the Container case...|$|E
40|$|This Article proposes {{the metaphor}} of {{connected}} contracts for understanding collaborative economic activity. 2 ̆ 2 Connected contracts 2 ̆ 2 refers to the interrelating agreements and relationships among the participants in a business venture. From the perspective offered by this metaphor, there are no firms, no predetermined hierarchies, no organizations with personalities of their own, and no a priori notions of ownership or control; there is no shareholder or managerial primacy and no centralizing 2 ̆ 2 nexus. 2 ̆ 2 The view is {{from the bottom up}} rather than from the top down. Boundaries and governance are not central issues, nor do they loom in the background. There are no boundaries and there is nothing to govern. The connected contracts perspective is applied to an important aspect of joint activity - the putative bargain over control. Looking at business activity as bargains among individuals who agree to undertake a specific project leads to the insight that control of the venture is not automatically allocated to equity. The concept of an owner has little value. The connected contracts perspetive suggests, among other things, that, all else equal, different capital structures can be viewed as representing different bargains over control. Capital structure is not irrelevant but reflects unique bargains over control in general and future decisions about projects in particular. The inquiry then broadens to encompass more participants and types of contributions and to speculate on how the connected contracts metaphor might affect thinking about a variety of topics in corporate and tax law, including piercing the corporate veil, insider trading, executing compensation, the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporations,</b> and the differential taxation of dept and equity. Finally, and tentatively, the Article offers a list of criteria that might be used to judge the value of models and metaphors and, by offering the list, suggests that scholars should be more conscious of the risks and rewards of reliance on models and metaphors...|$|E
