2500|$|The Lyn kinase activator, <b>tolimidone</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to potentiate insulin signaling {{in a manner that is}} distinct from the glitazones. [...] The compound has demonstrated positive results in a Phase 2a clinical study involving 130 diabetic subjects.|$|E
5000|$|Lyn {{has also}} been implicated to {{have a role in}} the insulin {{signaling}} pathway. Activated Lyn phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). This phosphorylation of IRS1 leads to an increase in translocation of Glut-4 to the cell membrane and increased glucose utilization. [...] In turn, activation of the insulin receptor has been shown to increase autophosphorylation of Lyn suggesting a possible feedback loop.The insulin secretagogue, glimepiride (AmarylÂ®) activates Lyn in adipocytes via the disruption of lipid rafts. [...] This indirect Lyn activation may modulate the extrapancreatic glycemic control activity of glimepiride. [...] <b>Tolimidone</b> is a small molecule lyn activator that is currently under Phase 2a investigation for Type II diabetes. [...] In June, 2016, the sponsor of these studies, Melior Discovery announced positive results from their Phase 2a study with <b>tolimidone</b> in diabetic patients.|$|E
