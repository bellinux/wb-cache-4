5|$|Mutations in the K-ras {{proto-oncogene}} {{are responsible}} for 10–30% of lung adenocarcinomas. About 4% of non-small-cell lung carcinomas involve an EML4-ALK <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> fusion gene.|$|E
5|$|For {{lung cancer}} cases that develop {{resistance}} to {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors, new drugs are in development. New EGFR inhibitors include afatinib and dacomitinib. An alternative signaling pathway, c-Met, can be inhibited by tivantinib and onartuzumab. New ALK inhibitors include crizotinib and ceritinib.|$|E
5|$|Several {{drugs that}} target {{molecular}} pathways in lung cancer are available, {{especially for the}} treatment of advanced disease. Erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib inhibit <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> at the epidermal growth factor receptor. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. It may be useful in the treatment of bone metastases.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{receptor}} <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> (RTKs), {{the second}} subgroup of <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases,</b> the non-receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> are cytoplasmic enzymes. Thirty-two non-receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> {{have been identified}} in human cells (...) [...] Non-receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and apoptosis, and they are critical components in the regulation of the immune system.|$|R
50|$|Janus <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> (JAKs), cytoplasmic <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> {{that are}} non-covalently {{associated}} with the cytoplasmic tails of receptors for cytokines or polypeptidic hormones.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> are {{particularly}} important today because of their implications {{in the treatment of}} cancer. A mutation that causes certain <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> to be constitutively active has been associated with several cancers. Imatinib (brand names Gleevec and Glivec) is a drug able to bind the catalytic cleft of these <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases,</b> inhibiting its activity.|$|R
5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E
5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground The Src family cytoplasmic <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> (SFK) are important signal transducers that are activated by many different classes of cell-surface receptors including re-ceptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases,</b> cytokine receptors, and integrin extracellular matrix receptors [1 - 3]. This kinase family consists of 11 homologous non-receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases...</b>|$|R
30|$|Analysis of gene-expression {{profiles}} {{can lead}} to the identification of patterns, which can then be targeted with different <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> Philadelphia-like ALL is exemplary here. The driver translocation t(9; 22) of Philadelphia (Ph) ALL, results in the overexpression of the ABL oncogene, activating other <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> itself. This spectrum of activation of different <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> can also be found in samples of ALL missing the Ph translocation. This Philadelphia-like leukemia has an unfavorable prognosis, similar to Ph positive ALL, and can at least be co-treated successfully with <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> as well [47].|$|R
25|$|In general, protein kinases are {{classified}} in two major categories {{based on their}} substrate specificity, protein <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> and protein serine/threonine kinases. Dual-specificity kinases are subclass of the <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E
5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues {{by a host}} cell membrane-associated <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E
25|$|Co-expression of {{the third}} protein may be {{necessary}} for modification or activation of {{one or both of}} the fusion proteins. For example, S. cerevisiae possesses no endogenous <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase.</b> If an investigation involves a protein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation, the kinase must be supplied in the form of a <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene.|$|E
40|$|This work unveils a {{previously}} unidentified {{function of the}} tumor suppressor pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) in inhibiting oncogenic signaling by suppressing the steady-state levels of receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> such as the EGF receptor. Specifically, PHLPP modifies the histone code to control the transcription of receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> This epigenetic function can account for the upregulation of receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> in the multiple cancer types where PHLPP function is compromised...|$|R
50|$|Together with <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases,</b> PTPs {{regulate}} the phosphorylation state of many important signalling molecules, {{such as the}} MAP kinase family.PTPs are increasingly viewed as integral components of signal transduction cascades, despite less study and understanding compared to <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Non-receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> (nRTKs) are cytoplasmic {{enzymes that}} are {{responsible}} for catalysing the transfer of a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate donor, such as ATP, to tyrosine residues in proteins. Non-receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> are a subgroup of protein family <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases,</b> enzymes that can transfer the phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue of a protein (phosphorylation). These enzymes regulate many cellular functions by switching on or switching off other enzymes in a cell.|$|R
25|$|According to PubMed, Schlessinger has {{authored}} over 450 scientific {{original and}} review {{articles in the}} areas of pharmacology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology, mostly on <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> signaling. <b>Tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> signaling plays a critical role in the control of many cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, as well as cell survival and migration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors {{are another}} investigational drug class {{that may have}} {{applications}} in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have {{also been shown to}} increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the protein}} kinase C pathway and the protein <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> {{pathways}} are activated, resulting in upregulating production of proinflammatory cytokines.|$|E
50|$|Phosphorylation of {{tyrosine}} residues in {{a protein}} occurs during signal transduction and {{is carried out}} by <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> In this way, phosphorylation of a substrate by <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> acts as a switch to trigger binding to an SH2 domain-containing protein. Many tyrosine containing short linear motifs that bind to SH2 domains are conserved across {{a wide variety of}} higher Eukaryotes. The intimate relationship between <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> and SH2 domains is supported by their coordinate emergence during eukaryotic evolution.|$|R
50|$|SYK, {{along with}} Zap-70, {{is a member}} of the Syk family of <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> These non-receptor cytoplasmic <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> share a {{characteristic}} dual SH2 domain separated by a linker domain. However, activation of SYK relies less on phosporylation by Src family kinases than Zap-70.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, RIN1 binds and {{activates}} ABL family <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the past, antimetabolites (e.g., cytarabine, hydroxyurea), alkylating agents, {{interferon}} alfa 2b, and steroids {{were used as}} treatments of CML in the chronic phase, but since the 2000s {{have been replaced by}} Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors drugs that specifically target BCR-ABL, the constitutively activated <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> fusion protein caused by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Despite the move to replacing cytotoxic antineoplastics (standard anticancer drugs) with <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors sometimes hydroxyurea is still used to counteract the high leukocyte counts encountered during treatment with <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors like imatinib; in these situations it may be the preferred myelosuppressive agent due to its relative lack of leukemogenic effects and hence the relative lack of potential for secondary hematologic malignancies to result from treatment. IRIS, an international study that compared interferon/cytarabine combination and the first of these new drugs imatinib, with long-term follow up, demonstrated the clear superiority of tyrosine-kinase-targeted inhibition over existing treatments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The lymphatic {{vascular}} system is {{actively involved in}} tissue fluid homeostasis, immune surveillance and fatty acid transport. Pathological conditions can arise from injury to the lymphatics, or they can be recruited {{in the context of}} cancer to facilitate metastasis. Protein <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> are central players in signal transduction networks and regulation of cell behavior. In the lymphatic endothelium, <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> are involved in processes such as the maintenance of existing lymphatic vessels, growth and maturation of new vessels and modulation of their identity and function. As such, they are attractive targets for both existing inhibitors and the development of new inhibitors which affect lymphangiogenesis in pathological states such as cancer. RNAi screening provides an opportunity to identify the functional role of <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> in the lymphatics.
