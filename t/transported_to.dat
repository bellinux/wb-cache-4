5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is {{absolutely}} required for coatomer vesicle formation on Golgi membranes {{but not for}} anterograde <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> the medial-Golgi in a mammalian in vitro transport system. This might indicate that the in vivo mechanism of intra-Golgi transport is not faithfully reproduced in vitro, or that intra-Golgi transport occurs by a nonvesicular mechanism. As one approach to distinguishing between these possibilities, we have characterized two additional cell-free systems that reconstitute <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> the trans-Golgi (trans assay) and trans-Golgi network (TGN assay). Like in vitro <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> the medial-Golgi (medial assay), <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> the trans-Golgi and TGN requires cytosol, ATP, and N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive fusion protein (NSF) ...|$|R

5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{significant}} drawbacks of freight by rail is its lack of door-to-door capability. It rarely has the ability <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> directly <b>to</b> the customer and must therefore rely on another mode of <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> deliver {{the last leg of}} the journey. It is clear, therefore, that the development of road-based transport cannot cease if there is a modal shift to rail. They must continue to develop together, as rail will still need to rely on a separate mode of <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> complete the journey.|$|R

This is the primary means by which cassava is <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> markets from production areas.|$|E
