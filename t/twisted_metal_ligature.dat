50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 2 (known as Twisted Metal: World Tour in Europe and <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> EX in Japan) is {{the second}} and most {{successful}} game in the vehicular combat series, <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal.</b> It {{was developed by the}} game studio SingleTrac, published by Sony, and released in 1996 for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows.|$|R
50|$|It is {{featured}} in the level 'North Pole' of PlayStation game <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> III and in the 2012 reboot simply titled <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> series {{prominently}} {{includes some}} settings based on Los Angeles. For example, Mount Lee {{can be seen}} in <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 2.|$|R
3000|$|... ➢ The sets of low {{friction}} (self-ligating and conventional brackets tied with ML) showed more standardized forces than conventional brackets with elastomeric <b>ligature.</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>ligature</b> promotes greater magnitude of forces than SLB.|$|R
50|$|Calypso is, to some extent, a {{prisoner}} of the <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> contest himself: he can't, for example, restore his daughter to 'life' unless she wishes for it. Additionally, endings in <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal,</b> <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 2, and Head-On show that his power seems to extend only to granting wishes; he can't, for example, stop Agent Shepard from arresting him via his powers, as Shepard refused to accept a wish. Similarly, in <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 2, he could not prevent Shadow from taking his soul as revenge {{for all the people}} who died due to the <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> competition. Also, in Twisted Metal: Head-On, Sweet Tooth wishes to change places with Calypso and, despite Calypso's refusal, it was granted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 4 {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, who considered {{it to be}} an improvement over the previous <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> III, particularly in terms of level design.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> was commercially successful. By 1996, <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> and Warhawk {{had sold}} over 500,000 units {{combined}} and generated some $28 {{million in revenue}} for publisher Sony. To date, <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> has sold over one million copies in the North America alone. As a result, Sony announced on March 3, 1997 that the game would be re-released {{as part of its}} budget Greatest Hits range of games.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 4 is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> series and the second and last installment to be developed by 989 Studios. The game's plot centers on Sweet Tooth, the long-time mascot of the titular <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> competition, overthrowing Calypso, the mysterious organizer of the competition, in a coup d'état. He then takes over the mantle of granting {{the winner of the}} competition a single wish, regardless of price, size or even reality.|$|R
5000|$|Head-On is {{a direct}} sequel to <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 2, {{ignoring}} the events of <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> III and <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 4. Akin to other games in the series, Head-On revolves around the same theme of a man named Calypso holding a vehicular combat tournament called [...] "Twisted Metal" [...] {{with the promise of}} granting the winner whatever they ask for. In 2006, Twisted Metal: Head-On {{was one of the first}} games in the PSP Greatest Hits line in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{what was}} {{essentially}} a complete relaunch and rebranding of the franchise with Twisted Metal: Black, Incognito {{decided to return to}} the series' roots and create a game that felt more like a true follow-up to the original <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> series, bringing back the bright colors and cartoony characters of <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 1 and 2. Available on the PSP in time for its North American launch, Twisted Metal: Head-On is considered by many fans - especially those disappointed by the non-Singletrac-developed titles - to be the true sequel to <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 2. Utilizing the PSP's built-in online capabilities, it also marked the first time a <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> game had full online play available from the start.|$|R
50|$|In {{development}} of <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 4, {{the game was}} reworked to improve upon the shortcomings of <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> III, introducing smoother gameplay and softer physics. Levels were expanded further and an increased arsenal of weapons was created which would ultimately become exclusive to this game.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> (2012) is {{the most}} recent game in the <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> series. It {{features}} multiple drivers and tracks. It also features multiplayer gameplay and other game modes. The game consists of three story arcs that focus on Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm and Dollface.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> on the PlayStation 3, Calypso sort of {{reverts to}} his {{long-haired}} look, only he's a bit younger than his other incarnations. In this game, he's {{the head of}} a large corporation and he's still the head of the <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> tournament.|$|R
50|$|An archwire will be {{threaded}} {{between the}} brackets and affixed with elastic or <b>metal</b> <b>ligatures.</b> Ligatures {{are available in}} a wide variety of colors, and the patient can choose which color they like. Archwires are bent, shaped, and tightened frequently to achieve the desired results.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{deflection}} force in conventional and thermally activated nickel-titanium (NiTi) wires in passive (Damon Q) and active (Bioquick) self-ligating brackets (SLB) and in conventional brackets (CB) tied by two different methods: elastomeric <b>ligature</b> (EL) and <b>metal</b> <b>ligature</b> (ML).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the fingering system and felt pads, Müller {{is also known as}} the inventor of <b>metal</b> <b>ligature</b> (that replaced twine, string and wire, widely used in the past and still used today in German-speaking regions), which are used today in almost all single-reeded woodwind instruments.|$|R
50|$|In {{development}} of <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> III, the source code and physics engine for <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> 2 weren't available {{because they were}} property of SingleTrac. Therefore, new ones had to be created from scratch instead. The new source code introduced advanced physics simulation and AI techniques to the series.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> is {{a vehicle}} combat video game {{developed}} by Eat Sleep Play {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It is a reboot of the <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> franchise. The game was originally planned {{to be released in}} October 2011 but was delayed to early 2012.|$|R

50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> {{features}} 50 different cars (although {{some different}} combinations of car and driver) in its eight incarnations (<b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal,</b> 2, III, 4, Black, Small Brawl, Head-On, and TM2012.) Many characters appear {{in more than one}} game of the series, although the same vehicles are not always driven by the same people.|$|R
5000|$|It {{contains}} extra {{features and}} bonuses {{such as the}} live action end movies from <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal,</b> (which at this point, had never been officially released) a behind the scenes documentary, and a concept art book. [...] There is also a code to download a <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> soundtrack. The game contained an {{answer to a question}} <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> fans have been asking for a long time. After fans deciphered a message in the Dark Past documentary as reading [...] "Twisted Metal is coming on psthree", Jaffe confirmed it himself.The PlayStation 2 port did not have online play.|$|R
5000|$|Sweet Tooth, {{real name}} Marcus [...] "Needles" [...] Kane, is {{designed}} around {{the premise of}} a killer clown who drives an ice cream truck, and his face has been featured {{on the cover of}} every <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> game to date, making him the series mascot. He is the only character besides his split-personality Marcus Kane to drive more than one vehicle in any of the games, being the driver of Head-On's Dark Tooth, Tower Tooth, and as of <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> Lost, Gold Tooth. He is voiced by J. S. Gilbert in Twisted Metal: Black and <b>Twisted</b> <b>Metal</b> (2012).|$|R
