5000|$|Chaos is {{the debut}} album by Mohamed Abozekry & Heejaz. Released on the 25th of March 2013, {{it refers to}} the torment and pain of a young {{musician}} who is helplessly watching as his country is going through a revolution. Therefore, every track is told as a story with each event and <b>twist</b> <b>setting</b> the pace and the rhythm of the composition. The track “25 janvier”, initially destined {{to be included in the}} album and then eventually withdrawn, pays tribute to the victims of the Egyptian revolution. It is available for free downloading on their official website.|$|E
5000|$|Act II {{was called}} “An Exercise in Democracy - for Under 500 Bucks,” in which Grieve and Spector picketed outside the 2008 Burning Man event. In {{a year the}} festival’s theme was “The American Dream,” this {{performance}} piece / peaceful protest, brought attention to their grant process. [...] Armed with three 1930’s-style picket signs reading “Art on Strike,” “B.R.C. LLC HARD ON Art,” and “Brush Your Teeth,” outside the gate the artists handed out 2000 flyers stating their case for a transparent grant process and treating artists with dignity. [...] In an ironic <b>twist,</b> <b>setting</b> legal precedent, they founded a “Freedom of Speech Zone” right outside the event.|$|E

The geometric assertion is modulo a hypothesis on root systems proven when the group is split, among other cases. The result extends the work of Finis-Lapid (and Müller, spectral side) to the <b>twisted</b> <b>setting.</b> We also give an application towards finiteness of residues of certain Rankin-Selberg L-functions.

40|$|We generalize quantum Drinfeld Hecke algebras by {{incorporating}} a 2 -cocycle on the associated finite group. We identify these algebras as specializations of deformations of twisted skew group algebras, giving an explicit connection to Hochschild cohomology. We classify these algebras for diagonal actions, {{as well as}} for the symmetric groups with their natural representations. Our results show that the parameter spaces for the symmetric groups in the <b>twisted</b> <b>setting</b> is smaller than in the untwisted setting. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
40|$|By a theorem of Bernhard Keller the de Rham cohomology of {{a smooth}} variety is {{isomorphic}} to the periodic cyclic homology of the differential graded category of perfect complexes on the variety. Both the de Rham cohomology and the cyclic homology can be twisted by the exponential {{of a regular}} function on the variety. We explain that the isomorphism holds true in the <b>twisted</b> <b>setting</b> and draw some conclusions on derived invariance of the algebraic Gauss-Manin systems associated with regular functions...|$|R

He meets her husband by visiting the man's used bookstore. Stackhouse has a troubled marriage, and his wife turns up dead.

50|$|Twisted {{is a film}} {{written and}} {{directed}} by Seth Michael Donsky. His debut film, it was released in 1997. The film, a Don Quixote and Miravista Films production, is a retelling of Charles Dickens' classic novel Oliver <b>Twist</b> <b>set</b> in a New York City contemporary underground populated by drag queens, drug abusers and hustlers. The film was an official selection and debuted in 1997 at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival, and was also screened as an official selection at the Seattle International Film Festival. Donsky's film was made prior to Jacob Tierney's similar film Twist, starring American actor Nick Stahl.|$|R

40|$|We extend Bezrukavnikov and Finkelberg's {{description}} of the G([[t]]) -equivariant derived category on the affine Grassmannian to the <b>twisted</b> <b>setting</b> of Finkelberg and Lysenko. Our description {{is in terms of}} coherent sheaves on the twisted dual Lie algebra. We also extend their computation of the corresponding loop rotation equivariant derived category, which is described in terms of Harish-Chandra bimodules for the twisted dual Lie algebra. To carry this out, {{we have to find a}} substitute for the functor of global equivariant cohomology. We describe such a functor, and show as in Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg that it is computed in terms of Kostant-Whittaker reduction on the dual side. Comment: Preliminary versio...|$|R

40|$|Let G be {{a simple}} simply-{{connected}} group over an algebraically closed field k, X be a smooth connected projective curve over k. In this paper we develop the theory of geometric Eisenstein series on the moduli stack Bun_G of G-torsors on X {{in the setting of}} the quantum geometric Langlands program (for étale l-adic sheaves) in analogy with [3]. We calculate the intersection cohomology sheaf on the version of Drinfeld compactification in our <b>twisted</b> <b>setting.</b> In the case G=SL_ 2 we derive some results about the Fourier coefficients of our Eisenstein series.

50|$|Texturising is {{the process}} by which {{synthetic}} fibres are modified to change their texture - the physical appearance of the fibre. Texturising techniques can include bulking (where thermoplastic fibres are <b>twisted,</b> heat <b>set</b> and untwisted), crimping and coiling, amongst others. Texturising takes advantage of the thermoplastic nature of synthetic fibres, and uses it to set texturised features in place.|$|R
40|$|Given an {{arbitrary}} field F of characteristic 0, we study Lie bialgebra structures on sl(n,F), {{based on the}} description of the corresponding classical double. For any Lie bialgebra structure δ, the classical double D(sl(n,F),δ) is isomorphic to sl(n,F) ⊗_F A, where A is either F[ε], with ε^ 2 = 0, or F⊕F or a quadratic field extension of F. In the first case, the classification leads to quasi-Frobenius Lie subalgebras of sl(n,F). In the second and third cases, a Belavin [...] Drinfeld cohomology can be introduced which enables one to classify Lie bialgebras on sl(n,F), up to gauge equivalence. The Belavin [...] Drinfeld untwisted and <b>twisted</b> cohomology <b>sets</b> associated to an r-matrix are computed. For the Cremmer [...] Gervais r-matrix in sl(3), we also construct a natural map of sets between the total Belavin [...] Drinfeld <b>twisted</b> cohomology <b>set</b> and the Brauer group of the field F.

40|$|We {{construct}} the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for twisted differential generalized cohomology theories. This generalizes to the <b>twisted</b> <b>setting</b> the authors' corresponding earlier construction for differential cohomology theories, {{as well as}} to the differential setting the AHSS for twisted generalized cohomology theories, including that of twisted K-theory by Rosenberg and Atiyah-Segal. In describing twisted differential spectra we build on the work of Bunke-Nikolaus, but we find it useful for our purposes to take an approach that highlights direct analogies with classical bundles and that is at the same time amenable for calculations. We will, in particular, establish that twisted differential spectra are bundles of spectra equipped with a flat connection. Our prominent case will be twisted differential K-theory, for which we work out the differentials in detail. This involves differential refinements of primary and secondary cohomology operations the authors developed in earlier papers. We illustrate our constructions and computational tools with examples.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Oxford University Press via [URL] introduce a norm on the space of test configurations, called the minimum norm. We conjecture that uniform K-stability {{is equivalent to the}} existence of a constant scalar curvature Kähler metric. This uniformity is analogous to coercivity of the Mabuchi functional. We show that a test configuration has zero minimum norm if and only if it has zero L 2 -norm, if and only if it is almost trivial. We prove the existence of a twisted constant scalar curvature Kähler metric that implies uniform twisted K-stability with respect to the minimum norm. We give algebro-geometric proofs of uniform K-stability in the general type and Calabi-Yau cases, as well as Fano case under an alpha invariant condition. Our results hold for nearby line bundles, and in the <b>twisted</b> <b>setting.</b> The author was funded by a studentship associated to an EPSRC Career Acceleration Fellowship (EP/J 002062 / 1) ...|$|R
