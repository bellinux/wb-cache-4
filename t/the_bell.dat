For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bells</b> is a 1926 American crime film {{directed}} by James Young, starring Lionel Barrymore and featuring Boris Karloff.

5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and <b>the</b> <b>bell,</b> and spoke of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E

5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of <b>the</b> <b>bell.</b> These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E

5|$|The Illinois Freedom Bell {{is located}} in Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, and is the {{official}} freedom bell of the U.S. state of Illinois. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> was created for a church in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as {{a replica of the}} Liberty Bell in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following a fire at the church, the ice cracked and <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> sank {{to the bottom of the}} lake. It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a gazebo on the village square. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E
