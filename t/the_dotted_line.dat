25|$|Toyota is a Japanese {{brand of}} {{automobiles}} that was exclusively distributed by Delta Motor Corporation, owned by former Bulacan congressman and Marcos crony Ricardo Silverio, Sr. The team was first {{known as the}} Komatsu Komets in the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA), {{one of the more}} successful teams of the amateur commercial league prior to the inception of the PBA. Sometime in January 1975, five MICAA teams met together at the old Elizalde canteen to sign a pre-organizational agreement for the formation of what is now known as the Philippine Basketball Association.

2500|$|A price drop for {{commodity}} X causes two effects. The {{reduced price}} alters relative prices {{in favour of}} commodity X, known as the substitution effect. This is illustrated by a movement down the indifference curve from point A to point B (a pivot of the budget constraint about the original indifference curve). At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the income effect (an outward shift of the budget constraint). This {{is illustrated by the}} shifting out of <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The substitution effect (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from Xa to Xb while the income effect lowers the quantity demanded from Xb to Xc. The net effect is a reduction in quantity demanded from Xa to Xc making commodity X a Giffen good by definition. Any good where the income effect more than compensates for the substitution effect is a [...] Giffen good.|$|E
2500|$|Graphically, {{this can}} be {{represented}} on a space-time diagram {{by the fact that}} a plot of the set of points regarded as simultaneous generates a line which depends on the observer. [...] In the space-time diagram, the dashed line represents a set of points considered to be simultaneous with the origin by an observer moving with a velocity v of one-quarter of the speed of light. [...] The dotted horizontal line represents the set of points regarded as simultaneous with the origin by a stationary observer. [...] This diagram is drawn using the (x, t) coordinates of the stationary observer, and is scaled so that the speed of light is one, i.e., so that a ray of light would be represented by a line with a 45° angle from the x axis. [...] From our previous analysis, given that v = 0.25 and c = 1, the equation of the dashed line of simultaneity is t – 0.25x = 0 and with v = 0, the equation of <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> of simultaneity is t = 0.|$|E

On passing {{the upper part of the}} rectangle from west to east into the position represented by <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> <b>line,</b> the marked pole of the magnetic needle went west; the electric current was therefore from north to south in the part of the wire passing under the needle, and from south to north in the moving or upper part of the parallelogram.
