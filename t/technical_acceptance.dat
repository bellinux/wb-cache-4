50|$|In 1947, {{responsibility}} for Explosive Ordnance Disposal training for all services was delegated to the Navy, and officers and enlisted of all services {{were added to}} the staff. This relationship flourished, and as the performance of the newly formed Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technicians improved, the demand for their unique talents increased. By 1958, facilities required to meet these increased requirements were met by the dedication of Surface and Nuclear Training Buildings. Subsequently, a half million gallon diving pool (underwater training facility) was constructed greatly expanding the capability of the school to train Naval Officers and enlisted personnel in the peculiarities of EOD diving. In late 1971, the Department of Defense consolidated the EOD Training and Technology Programs under the single managership of the Navy.

40|$|Introduction The {{computing}} {{capabilities of}} state-of-the-art television sets and media centres may facilitate {{the introduction of}} computer-assisted evaluation at home. This approach would help to overcome the drawbacks of traditional pen-and-paper evaluations administered in clinical facilities, {{as they could be}} performed in a more comfortable environment, the subject’s home, and they would be more flexible for designing complex environments for the evaluation of neuropsychological constructs that are difficult to assess through traditional testing. The objective of this work was to obtain some initial evidence about the <b>technical</b> <b>acceptance</b> by senior adults of serious games played at home on the TV set and therefore about the convenience of further investigating such an approach to cognitive assesment. Materials and Methods We developed a collection of games to be deployed on a TV environment. These games were tried by a group of senior adults at their homes. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to validate this approach. Surveys were performed to study the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of such technical setting as an instrument for their cognitive evaluation; that is, its <b>technical</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Subjective information collected from participants was correlated with actual interaction data captured. An additional survey was performed 36 months after pilot testing to have an indication about the long-term perceptions about usefulness and ease of use. Results More than 90 % of participating subjects perceived cognitive games on TV as useful or very useful. The majority of participants selected the TV set as their preferred option to interact with serious games at home, when compared to other devices such as smartphones, tablets or PCs. This result correlates with the number of participants perceiving them as easily usable or very easy to use, and also with automatically captured interaction data. Three out of four seniors expressed their interest in keeping the system at home after the pilot. Besides, these perceptions are fairly stable in time as shown by the survey performed 36 months after pilot testing. Limitations Although participating users are a representative sample of the Galician population, which in turn is comparable to the population of most rural areas in Europe, a larger and more diverse user sample would be needed to obtain significant results for a wider population profile. Conclusion The study confirmed the <b>technical</b> <b>acceptance,</b> that is, the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, of the TV-based home technical setting introduced as a means of cognitive evaluation. This study provides initial evidence on the viability of a TV-based serious games approach for cognitive longitudinal screening at home with little intervention of clinical professionals, thus contributing to the early detection of cognitive impairments in the senior population...|$|E

Sociotechnical theory, and the <b>Technical</b> <b>Acceptance</b> Model (TAM) were used as a methodology to identify and predict the relationship of these factors to implementation of the card. Through the preliminary survey in 1997, the key factors (e. g. awareness of the ECID card, confidence in government, information crimes, privacy concerns and electronic surveillance) were discovered, and the identified key factors were also tested to discover their relationship to user acceptance of the ECID card by the primary survey in 1999. This study developed the influential model to identify influential relationships between the key sociotechnical factors and user acceptance of the ECU) card, with the multi-variable analysis of the primary survey. As a result, it was identified that information crimes do not significantly impact on the user acceptance of the ECID card, but other factors are significant. This influential model also demonstrated that awareness of the ECID card and confidence in government have a highly positive impact on user acceptance of the ECID card, while privacy concerns and electronic surveillance have a significantly lower impact. This study discussed the ideological conflicts between Korean society and other countries to discover the reasons for positive and lower impacts between user acceptance, privacy concerns and electronic surveillance.

40|$|The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Joint Actinide Shock Physics Experimental Research (JASPER) Facility {{is being}} {{developed}} at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) to conduct shock physics experiments on special nuclear material and other actinide materials. JASPER will use a two-stage, light-gas gun to shoot projectiles at actinide targets. Projectile velocities will range from 1 to 8 km/s, inducing pressures in the target material up to 6 Mbar. The JASPER gas gun {{has been designed to}} match the critical dimensions of the two-stage, light-gas gun in Building 341 of LLNL. The goal in copying the LLNL gun design is {{to take advantage of the}} extensive ballistics database that exists and to minimize the effort spent on gun characterization in the initial facility start-up. A siting study conducted by an inter-Laboratory team identified Able Site in Area 27 of the NTS as the best location for the JASPER gas gun. Able Site consists of three major buildings that had previously been used to support the nuclear test program. In April 1999, Able Site was decommissioned as a Nuclear Explosive Assembly Facility and turned back to the DOE for other uses. Construction and facility modifications at Able Site to support the JASPER project started in April 1999 and were completed in September 1999. The gas gun and the secondary confinement chamber (SCC) were installed in early 2000. During the year, all facility and operational systems were brought on line. Initial system integration demonstrations were completed in September 2000. The facility is anticipated to be operational by August 2001, and the expected life cycle for the facility is 10 years.
