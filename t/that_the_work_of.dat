Paul Hindemith wrote a trimmed adaption which probably helped to keep {{the work in the}} repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. It was first performed in Wiesbaden, where the composer studied, in 2003. The celebration of the Reger Year 2016 led to several performances.|$|E

Goldstein argues that the Technion and Ramban mtDNA studies fail to actually establish a statistically significant link between modern Jews and historic Middle Eastern populations.

25|$|One of the {{classical}} accounts {{about the existence of}} an Armenian alphabet before Mashtots comes from Philo of Alexandria (20 BCE – 50 CE), who in his writings notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Greek philosopher and historian Metrodorus of Scepsis (ca. 145 BCE – 70 BCE), On Animals, was translated into Armenian. Metrodorus was a close friend and a court historian of the Armenian emperor Tigranes the Great, and also wrote his biography. Another third century Roman theologian, Hippolytus of Rome (170-235 CE), in his Chronicle, while writing about his contemporary, Emperor Severus Alexander (reigned 208-235 CE), mentions that the Armenians are amongst those nations who have their own distinct alphabet.|$|E

25|$|With the New Zealanders {{holding the}} {{dominant}} redoubt, the 1st and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades {{were able to}} advance and capture the remaining redoubts on their fronts. As the 3rd Battalion of the Imperial Camel Brigade approached the B group of trenches, a white flag appeared, and the B2 and the central work of B group were occupied by 16:50. They captured five officers and 214 other ranks while the Warwickshire Yeomanry captured the B1 redoubt and another 101 prisoners. These successful attacks were supported by aircraft, which bombed the redoubts and trenches. The aircraft had recently been fitted with wirelesses, and during the afternoon reported {{the progress of the}} battle to the Desert Column's headquarters, assisting in command and control. The New Zealanders remained close to the main redoubt system while prisoners were collected and sent to Sheikh Zowaiid and the four captured guns taken away. Chetwode reported to the commander of Eastern Force, Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> all troops engaged had been excellent, and the part played by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade had been outstanding.|$|E
25|$|Hand G, {{who may or}} may {{not have}} been Jan van Eyck, paralleled the {{achievement}} and innovation of that artist's panel paintings in the miniature form, firstly in the technical development of the tempera medium and use of glazes to achieve unprecedented detail and subtlety, and also in his illusionist realism, especially seen in interiors and landscapes – the John the Baptist page shows both well. Many of the background portions of the attributed leaves seem concerned with the depiction of receding space, and it is often thought that in this aspect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Hand G is most innovative. However, from the earlier pages he seems to be grappling with the techniques for the first time. He was successful early on in showing space receding over reflective water or within interior spaces, but appears to have experienced more difficulty with landscape. Early attempts, for example Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane in which three imposing figures in the foreground are presented before a distant hillscape, see him, perhaps crudely, eliminating the mid-ground to create the illusion of distance. Yet the underdrawing show him already experimenting with more effective and innovative techniques he was later to master, such as lowering the line of the horizon, and using radiating verticals to increase the sense of depth.|$|E
25|$|Towards 500 a Scythian monk, {{known as}} Dionysius Exiguus, {{who had come}} to Rome after the death of Pope Gelasius (496), and who was well skilled in both Latin and Greek, {{undertook}} to bring out a more exact translation of the canons of the Greek councils. In a second effort he collected papal decretals from Siricius (384-89) to Anastasius II (496-98), inclusive, anterior therefore, to Pope Symmachus (514-23). By order of Pope Hormisdas (514-23), Dionysius made a third collection, in which he included the original text of all the canons of the Greek councils, together with a Latin version of the same; but the preface alone has survived. Finally, he combined the first and second in one collection, which thus united the canons of the councils and the papal decretals; it is in this shape <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Dionysius has reached us. This collection opens with a table or list of titles, each of which is afterwards repeated before the respective canons; then come the first fifty canons of the Apostles, the canons of the Greek councils, the canons of Carthage (419), and the canons of preceding African synods under Aurelius, which had been read and inserted in the Council of Carthage. This first part of the collection is closed by a letter of Pope Boniface I, read at the same council, letters of Cyril of Alexandria and Atticus of Constantinople to the African Fathers, and a letter of Pope Celestine I. The second part of the collection opens likewise with a preface, {{in the shape of a}} letter to the priest Julian, and a table of titles; then follow one decretal of Siricius, twenty-one of Innocent I, one of Zozimus, four of Boniface I, three of Celestine I, seven of pope Leo I, one of Gelasius I and one of Anastasius II. The additions met with in Voel and Justel are taken from inferior manuscripts.|$|E

500|$|Anthropologists {{generally}} have less favorable {{views of the}} missionary work begun by Operation Auca, viewing the intervention as the cause for the recent and widely recognized decline of Huaorani culture. Leading Huaorani researcher Laura Rival says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the SIL [...] "pacified" [...] the Huaorani during the 1960s, and argues that missionary intervention caused significant changes in fundamental components of Huaorani society. Prohibitions of polygamy, violence, chanting, and dancing were directly contrary to cultural norms, and the relocation of Huaorani and subsequent intermarrying of previously hostile groups eroded cultural identity.|$|E
500|$|Louis XVI was {{executed}} on 21 January 1793, and on 8 August of that year, {{on the eve}} of the Reign of Terror, the new de facto government executive, the Committee of Public Safety, suppressed all academies, and with it the commission, requiring them to justify their existence.

500|$|Others are {{somewhat}} less negative—Brysk, after noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the missionaries opened {{the area to}} outside intervention {{and led to the}} deterioration of the culture, says that the SIL also informed the Huaorani of their legal rights and taught them how to protect their interests from developers. Boster goes even further, suggesting that the [...] "pacification" [...] of the Huaorani was a result of [...] "active effort" [...] by the Huaorani themselves, not the result of missionary imposition. He argues that Christianity served as a way for the Huaorani to escape the cycle of violence in their community, since it provided a motivation to abstain from killing.|$|E
