[...] After {{appearing}} briefly in a double act with his brother, Hurley started work as a <b>tea</b> <b>packer</b> at London's docklands and bagan to exercise excessively in his spare time. His new fitness capabilities allowed him to take up boxing. He wrote the song [...] "The Strongest Man In The World" [...] during his time as a boxer, which he would regularly perform after fights. Singing interested Hurley and he began to perform the song on the music hall circuit. He found his niche as a coster singer and was likened to Albert Chevalier.|$|E
40|$|Background: Tea may be {{classified}} as unfermented green, semi-fermented oolong and fermented black. All of these types are derived from Camellia sinensis, the Tea Plant, which contains the low molecular weight (LMW) agent Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), probably responsible for allergic reactions. The aim of our study was to asses the work-related allergic symptoms and IgE-mediated sensitivity among black <b>tea</b> <b>packers.</b> Material and Methods: Study groups comprised 26 black <b>tea</b> <b>packers</b> (group 1) and 20 office workers (group 2). A questionnaire, skin prick tests (SPTs) to common allergens and black tea, evaluation of specific IgE (asIgE) to Camellia sinensis and moulds, pre- and post-work-shift spirometry were performed. Results: At least 1 symptom suggesting allergic disease was reported by 85 % of the <b>tea</b> <b>packers</b> and 60 % of the office workers. The most frequent positive results of SPTs were obtained with moulds (8 %). A small decline in FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) after the work shift was observed among <b>tea</b> <b>packers</b> sensitized to moulds. Conclusions: Although specific sensitization to black tea was not observed in our study groups, cough and skin symptoms were significantly more frequently among the <b>tea</b> <b>packers</b> than in office workers. The irritant impact on the airways and the skin of tea dust and/or sensitization to moulds contaminating tea leaves are being suspected. Med Pr 2015; 66 (1) : 11 – 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{questionnaire}} survey of respiratory symptoms {{was carried out}} {{on a group of}} subjects with exposure to tea fluff in a packaging plant and compared with a group of unexposed workers. The subjects had a higher prevalence of rhinitis, bouts of coughing and chest tightness than the controls. Except in the case of rhinitis however, the differences disappeared when allowance was made for either hay fever or smoking. From the original group of subjects, two smaller groups were chosen, one with and one without symptoms, and peak expiratory flow rates were measured over a 12 -day period, including eight working and four non-working days. The mean difference in peak flow was greater on the non-working than on the working days and was not related to age, sex, years of exposure, smoking or atopy. We conclude that there is little evidence to suggest that this group of <b>tea</b> <b>packers</b> shows signs of sensitization but that they are probably exposed to an irritant in the tea fluff.
