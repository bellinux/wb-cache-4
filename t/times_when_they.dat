Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. Birds were later used {{as symbols of}} power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.|$|E

25|$|The Ashanti Akrafena (Sword of my Soul) was {{generally}} {{held in the}} hand by Ashanti Asafos. There was no real reason to hold it on their sides.

The Ashanti sword was first and foremost one-handed, though for more powerful strikes, two hands were used. The Ashanti techniques were generally hand and a half.|$|E
25|$|The militaristic {{nature of}} Goguryeo has {{frequently}} drawn them into conflicts with dynasties in China. In the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> {{are not in}} war with China, Goguryeo occasionally sent tributes {{to some of the}} Chinese dynasties as a form of trade and nonaggression pact. These activities of exchange promoted cultural and religious flow from China into the Korean peninsula. Goguryeo has also received tribute from other Korean kingdoms and neighboring tribal states, and frequently mobilized Malgal people in their military. Baekje and Goguryeo maintained their regional rivalry throughout their history, although they eventually formed an alliance in their wars against Silla and Tang.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in burlesque theater, {{the modern}} popular form of strip theater can {{minimize}} {{the interaction of}} customer and dancer, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed to undress. Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, {{he or she will}} emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.|$|E
25|$|A new {{signal was}} {{introduced}} instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances {{would make it}} difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away {{with the rest of the}} fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.|$|E

25|$|The {{two days}} of funeral rites began on December 15 with the {{reception}} of the body at St Charles Borromeo Seminary, Overbrook, from which Foley was ordained just shy of a half-century earlier. The daylong viewing in St Martin's Chapel ended with Mass celebrated by the senior auxiliary of Philadelphia, Bishop Daniel Thomas, who was a close friend. The funeral took place next day in the Philadelphia Cathedral-Basilica {{where he had been}} ordained a priest and bishop and in whose crypt he was then buried. In keeping with preferences expressed by Cardinal Foley during his final weeks, Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, his successor as head of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, celebrated the liturgy. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, Archbishop of New York and USCCB president, was the homilist. Both presider and preacher were friends of the deceased cardinal since the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> headed the Pontifical North American College in Rome.|$|E
25|$|When {{the fifteen}} round format was first {{introduced}} in September 2001, {{the composition of the}} rounds was different from that used by the programme today. The three sections each had five rounds, four letters rounds and one numbers round in each of the first two sections, with three letters rounds, one numbers round and the conundrum in the third section. This meant that there was a slight imbalance, whereby one contestant made the letters sections for six rounds, but had the choice of the numbers selection just once, whereas the other contestant chose letters five times and numbers twice. The dictionary corner guest's spot was immediately before the first advertising break, and Susie Dent's Origin of Words spot preceded the second numbers game shortly before the second break. The change to the present format was made on 25 March 2013, three weeks into the second section of Series 68, to comply with Channel 4's decision {{to increase the amount of}} adverts and alter the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> occur during the programme, therefore reducing Countdown's actual show length from 36 to 35 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well.
