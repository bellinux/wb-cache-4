6000|$|... "Look here," [...] said Lord Pooley, [...] "I've taken a {{considerable}} responsibility, on your bare word. I {{think you ought}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about this." ...|$|E
6000|$|He edged over {{close to}} the plainsman and, in a pause in the talk, whispered to him: [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about the Indians." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] she began. [...] "I {{do not ask}} you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> {{about that}} night--I do not wish <b>to</b> hear anything. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> instead {{exactly what it is}} that you want from me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nigel {{looked at}} the old woman with shining eyes. [...] "I love to hear you speak of him," [...] said he. [...] "I pray you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> once <b>more</b> of the manner of his death." ...|$|R
3000|$|Researcher: I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> in <b>more</b> detail. When you started writing, haven’t you think to gather {{information}} from the internet or other resources? Or have you just been satisfied with your personal experience? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "The air {{will soon}} revive you," [...] he said. [...] "As to our conversation, I am disappointed. I {{think that you}} are very foolish not <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|Was it {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> plainly that I was not wanted? I {{did my best}} to express indignation by snatching my hand away from him. He was completely taken by surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he said simply, [...] "if {{you would}} think me impertinent if I were to ask you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about yourself. How {{is it that you}} are {{altogether}} alone in the world?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Just {{when the}} man from Boston was {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> some <b>more</b> stories about first families, the Professor developed an unholy taste for hot springs, and bore me off to a place called Myanoshita to wash myself. [...] "We'll come {{back and look at}} Yokohama later on, but we must go to this because it's so beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be seated, please. I {{want to go}} {{over our}} case with you. First of all, I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> once <b>more,</b> and in full detail, all you know of your mother's life. Begin at the {{beginning}} and leave nothing out. Don't theorize or try to explain--give me the facts as you have observed them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} this was all thrashed out at the inquest, Brookes," [...] he said, [...] "but I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> once <b>more.</b> You see how far it is from this table to the door. My uncle must have had {{abundant}} warning of any one approaching. Was there no other way by which any one could have entered the room?" ...|$|R
60|$|This was important, I thought, {{and would}} lead to the very {{knowledge}} I wished for; so I pressed her <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about the settlement she had named, and of which I had never heard.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘And now, my dear,’ {{he said at}} this point, ‘if you are not {{too tired}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> of what passed to-day—but only if you feel quite able—I should be glad to hear it. I may digest it the better, if I sleep on it to-night.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> yet, and much more," [...] she said. [...] "You know this passes {{through my mind}} like a tale that is told. You even ... In a day perhaps, or after several days, I shall believe in you. Now--Now I am dreaming.... Listen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'A {{letter from}} the enemy,' he said. 'It is from Trant, who must be a good fellow {{as well as a}} brave soldier, as we know <b>to</b> our cost. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about this, Rignold.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about it," [...] she remarked. [...] "You have {{something}} on your mind, something {{which you are}} half disposed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> a little <b>more</b> than half, I think. Go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O dear, no; but as {{he wanted}} me to find it out for him, and said that not a soul knew about the matter but me, I thought the {{simplest}} way would be <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you all he said, and then ask you straight. He was going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something <b>more,</b> very particularly, for he was just saying, in a very solemn tone, `You must on no account mention--' when your little dog bounced in and Jenkins bounced out, leaving the rest of it unsaid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You promised <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> {{about some}} of these people," [...] he {{reminded}} her. [...] "I am driven to make guesses all the time. Why does Mr. Starling look so much like an unwilling and impatient guest? And where is the castle of the Count Sabatini which has no roof?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Flossie was tacking her {{way towards}} them. Joan acted on impulse. [...] "I wish you'd {{give me your}} address," [...] she said [...] "where I could write to you. Or perhaps you would not mind my coming and seeing you one day. I would like you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} more careful of this than of any other property," [...] said Deronda, smiling and putting the key in his breast-pocket. [...] "I never before possessed {{anything}} that was a sign to me of so much cherished hope and effort. And I shall never forget that the effort was partly yours. Have you time <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> of my grandfather? Or shall I be trespassing in staying longer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] {{the prince}} said, [...] "I would beg you {{to seek out}} the captain of the boat in which you came here, and bid him come to me this time {{tomorrow}} evening. I would fain hear from him somewhat further details as to how you escaped from the Spaniards, for I observed that in this matter you were a little reticent as to your share in it. He may be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> too, <b>more</b> about the strength of the Spanish garrisons in Bergen and its neighbourhood than you can do." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} part of {{learning a new language}} is to pay great attention <b>to</b> pronunciation. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is language learning software by Auralog which offers the students a diverse set of pronunciation activities with high levels of interaction and fully engaging the student in the learning process. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> enables the teacher to have more quality time in the classroom. The objective of this research is <b>to</b> identify whether <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is better than Rosetta Stone to assist teaching pronunciation of English. This experimental research was carried out to University students of English Department. The population was the second semester students. Two classes taken in this research were the experimental class and the control class. The independent variables are the use of teaching media and the attributive factor is students’ self-confidence while the dependent variable is pronunciation skill. Results: (1) <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is more effective than Rosetta Stone to assist teaching pronunciation of English; (2) students having high self-confidence have better pronunciation skill than students having low self-confidence; and (3) there is an interaction between the media used and students’ self-confidence in teaching pronunciation. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is more effective than Rosetta Stone in teaching pronunciation for students having high and low self-confidence. Keywords: <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More,</b> Rosetta Stone, pronunciation, self-confidence, experimental stud...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} trouble <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> any <b>more,</b> Jack," [...] Nelly Hardy said indignantly. [...] "I know {{it all by}} heart. You worked three hours with Mr. Merton; dinner at six; some people came at eight, no one in particular; they talked, {{and there was some}} playing on the piano; they went away at twelve. Next morning after breakfast you went to church, had dinner at two, took a walk afterwards, had tea at half-past six, supper at nine, then to bed. I won't ask you any more questions, Jack; if {{anything}} out of the way takes place you will <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> no doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For a time I was so {{overwhelmed}} with this news that I {{could think of}} nothing, but went out and roamed through the streets. At last I bethought me of the girl Ruth. She was with Mysa at the time, and might, if questioned, be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> than the old woman had done. I therefore returned, but {{had to wait for}} three hours before old Lyptis came out again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I {{got to the}} camp,' she said, 'there did {{not seem}} to be a soul about, I went into the centre and stood there. Suddenly a tall woman stood beside me. [...] "Something told me I was wanted!" [...] she said. I held out my hand and laid a piece of silver on it. She took from her neck a small golden trinket and laid it there also; and then, seizing the two, threw them into the stream that ran by. Then she took my hand in hers and spoke: [...] "Naught but blood in this guilty place," [...] and turned away. I caught hold of her and asked her <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more.</b> After some hesitation, she said: [...] "Alas! alas! I see you lying at your husband's feet, and his hands are red with blood".' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose if I {{got from}} this man the {{information}} I am most anxious about," [...] thought Deronda, [...] "I should be contented enough {{if he felt}} no disposition <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> of himself, or why {{he seemed to have}} some expectation from me which was disappointed. The sort of curiosity he stirs would die out; and yet it might be that he had neared and parted as one can imagine two ships doing, each freighted with an exile who would have recognized the other if the two could have looked out face to face. Not that there is any likelihood of a peculiar tie between me and this poor fellow, whose voyage, I fancy, must soon be over. But I wonder whether there is much of that momentous mutual missing between people who interchange blank looks, or even long for one another's absence in a crowded place. However, one makes one's self chances of missing by going on the recruiting sergeant's plan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you will}} be kind enough <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> a little <b>more</b> about it, Mr. Strelinski," [...] Julian said, turning to the Pole, {{and in spite of}} a growl from Frank that there was nothing <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> the Pole related the whole {{circumstances}} of the quarrel, the feeling that had been excited by it, Frank's expressed determination not to inflict serious injury upon the man but to carry away his trigger-finger only, and so put an end to his duels in the future, {{and the manner in which}} his intention was carried out.|$|R

Bob Dylan He showed an early {{interest}} in music and began playing piano at age 8. Studying classical music in his early teens, he learned to play the oboe so he could join the high school band, and during his senior year joined the Akron Symphony Orchestra. He eventually earned his B.A. in Music Education from the University of Akron, moved to New York City, and received an M.A. from Columbia University.|$|R
60|$|Where she went, why she went, {{and what}} {{happened}} to her during that time, I do not know. There was no way for her <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> any <b>more</b> than there was a way for Lop-Ear and <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the Folk what we had seen when we were away. Like us, the chance is she had gone off on an adventure-journey, and by herself. On the other hand, it is possible that Red-Eye may have been the cause of her going. It is quite certain that he must have come upon her from time to time, wandering in the woods; and if he had pursued her there is no question but {{that it would have been}} sufficient to drive her away. From subsequent events, I am led to believe that she must have travelled far to the south, across a range of mountains and down to the banks of a strange river, away from any of her kind. Many Tree People lived down there, and I think it must have been they who finally drove her back to the horde and to me. My reasons for this I shall explain later.|$|R
6000|$|Such was the {{remarkable}} narrative to which I listened on that April evening--a narrative {{which would have}} been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall, spare figure and the keen, eager face, which I had never thought to see again. In some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words. [...] "Work is the best antidote to sorrow, my dear Watson," [...] said he; [...] "and I have a piece of work for us both to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion, will in itself justify a man's life on this planet." [...] In vain I begged him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more.</b> [...] "You will hear and see enough before morning," [...] he answered. [...] "We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice until half-past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{think of}} the charm of {{possibly}} taking up with you by the Lamb House fire the various interesting impressions, allusions, American references and memories etc., with which your letter is so richly bedight, I kind of feel that you must come, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> of everything.... So, just yet, I shall reserve these thrills; for I feel that I shall and must, by hook or by crook, see you. I expect to go abroad about Feb. 5th for a few weeks--but that won't prevent. I rejoice to hear your news, however sketchy, of the Islander of Ely and the Librarian of Magdalene. Commend me as handsomely {{as possible to the}} lone Islander--how gladly would I at the very perfect right moment be his man Friday, or Saturday, or, even better, Sunday!--and tell Percy Lubbock, with my love, that I missed him acutely the other week at Windsor (which he will understand and perhaps even believe.) What disconcerted me in your letter was your mention of your having, while in America, been definitely ill--a proceeding of which I wholly disapprove. I desire {{to talk to you about}} that, too, even though I meanwhile discharge upon you, my dear Gaillard, the abounding sympathy of yours always and ever, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I took my translatophone {{from the}} cabinet in which I kept it. The {{easiest way to}} destroy it was to throw it at once into the fire; but that would fill {{the house with the}} smell of burning rubber. No; it was only {{necessary}} to destroy the internal movements. I unscrewed the long mouth-piece, and gently withdrew from it the little membrane-covered cylinder, not six inches in length, which formed the soul of my invention. I took it in my hand and gazed upon it. Through its thin, flexible, and almost transparent outer envelope I could see, as I held it to the light, its framework, fine as the thread-like bones of a fish, its elastic chords, its quivering diaphragms, and all the delicate organs of its inner life. It seemed as if I could feel the palpitations of its heart as I breathed upon it. For how many days and months had I been working on this subtle invention--working, and thinking, and dreaming! Here it lay, perfect, finished, ready <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> than any man ever has known--a thing almost of life, and ready to be brought to life by the voice of man or beast or bird, or perhaps of any living thing. Could I have the heart to destroy it? Could I have the heart to turn my back upon the gate of the world of wonders which was just opening to me? ...|$|E
40|$|Journalists {{and editors}} work under {{pressure}} to collect relevant details and background information about specific events. They spend {{a significant amount of}} time sifting through documents and finding new information such as facts, opinions or stakeholders (i. e. people, places and organizations that have a stake in the news). Spotting them is a tedious and cognitively intense process. One task, essential to this process, is to find and keep track of stakeholders. This task is taxing cognitively and in terms of memory. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> offers an automatic aid <b>to</b> this task. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> is a system that, given a seed story, mines the web for similar stories reported by different sources and selects only those stories which offer new information with respect to that original seed story. Much like a journalist, the task of detecting named entities is central to its success. In this paper we briefly describe <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> and, in particular, we focus on <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More’s</b> entity detection component. We describe an approach that combines off-the-shelf named entity recognizers (NERs) with WPED, a publicly available NER that uses Wikipedia as its knowledge base. We show significant increase in precision scores with respect to traditional NERs. Lastly, we present an overall evaluation of <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> using this approach...|$|R

He says he knows your husband well; that he treated you very badly, and that you are greatly to be pitied. Can you guess now? He says he has kissed you--for shame, Hetty! Have you guessed yet? He was going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>more</b> when we were interrupted, and I have not seen him since except at a distance. He is the man with whom you eloped that day when you gave us all such a fright--Mr. Sidney. I was the first to penetrate his disguise; and that very morning I had taxed him with it, and he had confessed it. He said then that he was hiding from a woman who was in love with him; and I should not be surprised if {{it turned out to be}} true; for he is wonderfully original--in fact what makes me like him is that he is by far the cleverest man I have ever met; and yet he thinks nothing of himself. I cannot imagine what he sees in me to care for, though he is evidently ensnared by my charms. I hope he won't find out how silly I am. He called me his golden idol--" ...|$|R
