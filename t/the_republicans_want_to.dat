Harris, one Mississippian secession commissioner, told {{a meeting}} of the Georgian general {{assembly}} that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> implement [...] "equality between the white and negro races" [...] and thus secession was necessary for the slave states to resist their efforts.|$|R
50|$|General Fernandez and Lon Nol {{left the}} country before the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh in 1975. All <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>the</b> Civil War in Cambodia. Several others {{officials}} such as Long Boret, Lon Non and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak remained in office until the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975. They mistakenly thought {{that they would be}} spared through the intercession of Norodom Sihanouk, but were executed by the Khmer Rouge.|$|R
500|$|There {{were two}} main {{divisive}} issues in 1868. The {{first was the}} continued Reconstruction of the South. The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices, and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> endorsed <b>the</b> proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote. The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks. The Democrats <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> redeem the bonds with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. The greenbacks were known as [...] "cheap money" [...] and would be inflationary. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>the</b> redemption of war bonds only with gold, a position attractive to investors and bankers.|$|R
50|$|Tariffs {{soon became}} a major {{political}} issue as the Whigs (1832-1852) and (after 1854) <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> protect their mostly northern industries and constituents by voting for higher tariffs and the Southern Democrats, which had very little industry but imported many goods voted for lower tariffs. Each party as it came into power voted to raise or lower tariffs under the constraints that the Federal Government always needed {{a certain level of}} revenues. The United States public debt was paid off in 1834 and President Andrew Jackson, a strong Southern Democrat, oversaw the cutting of the tariff rates roughly in half and eliminating nearly all federal excise taxes in about 1835.|$|R
50|$|In other words, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> judges <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> retain {{all state}} {{bankruptcy}} {{laws and the}} Federalists <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> abolish them all. Minority <b>Republicans</b> agreed on <b>the</b> best bargain they could by agreeing to sacrifice the New York law if the rest were not deemed unconstitutional.|$|R
50|$|African American {{males were}} allowed to vote in Alabama until 1901, when the state disenfranchised them {{although}} still letting them register. <b>The</b> Negro <b>Republican</b> Party in Birmingham, Alabama was organized in opposition to <b>the</b> lily-white <b>Republican</b> party, after that party prevented any of the twenty-five black delegates from taking part in its Birmingham convention.In Maryland, while the Democrats were typically against allowing blacks to vote at all, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give them this and other basic rights, but many did not <b>want</b> blacks <b>to</b> hold important political offices or to have frequent contact with whites. Their vote was important to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> though. In 1909, {{at a time when}} the Democrats were pushing for disenfranchisement in <b>the</b> state, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> called on all members of <b>the</b> Negro <b>Republican</b> Party to turn out on voting day in every district.|$|R

5000|$|The party {{coalesced}} around Jefferson, who diligently maintained extensive {{correspondence with}} like-minded <b>Republican</b> leaders throughout <b>the</b> country. Washington frequently decried the {{growing sense of}} [...] "party" [...] emerging from the internal battles among Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Adams and others in his administration. As warfare in Europe increased, the two factions increasingly made foreign policy the central political issue of <b>the</b> day. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> 1777 alliance with France, which had overthrown the monarchy and aristocracy and become a republic. Even though Britain was by far America's leading trading partner, Republicans feared that increased trade would undermine republicanism. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> distrusted Hamilton's national bank and rejected his premise that a national debt was good for <b>the</b> country; <b>Republicans</b> said they were both forms of corruption. They strongly distrusted the elitism of Hamilton's circle, denouncing it as [...] "aristocratic"; and they called for states' rights lest the Federalists centralize ever more power in the national governments.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Missouri <b>Republicans</b> {{believe that}} <b>the</b> {{traditional}} {{family is the}} foundation of the U.S. and it is the country's future. <b>The</b> Missouri <b>Republicans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> encourage <b>the</b> values of hard work and personal responsibility. They believe that marriage should only happen {{between a man and a}} woman, and that is the only type of marriage they will support no matter what state it took place in. The party also <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> end the marriage penalty in the state's tax code.|$|R
50|$|One health-care {{issue is}} the problem that healthy people will go without {{insurance}} and then buy coverage only if they need it, such as after an accident or a diagnosis of serious illness. Insurers that must cover such people have to charge high premiums to everyone, {{to be able to}} meet those expenses. The ACA addressed this problem by requiring everyone to purchase insurance and imposing a tax penalty on those who did not. This individual mandate {{was one of the most}} unpopular parts of the ACA, so <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> repeal it. <b>The</b> AHCA would replace it with a provision that, if someone went without coverage for 63 days or more, an insurer could add a 30 percent surcharge to the premium. The original draft of the BCRA would have repealed the ACA's individual mandate but it did not include the AHCA's continuous coverage provision. A few days after the draft's release, therefore, it was amended to provide that someone who went without coverage for 63 days or more would have to wait six months to obtain new coverage.|$|R
50|$|From the 1860s to the 1940s, {{conservative}} Democrats came to mean opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Radical <b>Republicans</b> who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> grant full citizenship {{rights to}} freed slaves and take political power {{away from the}} ex-Confederates. In the 1940s, the Democratic Party began to advocate against segregation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{pressure}} Britain to {{the brink}} of war (and assumed that America could defeat a weak Britain). Therefore, they denounced the Jay Treaty as an insult to American prestige, a repudiation of the French alliance of 1777, and a severe shock to Southern planters who owed those old debts, and who were never to collect for the lost slaves <b>the</b> British captured. <b>Republicans</b> protested against <b>the</b> treaty, and organized their supporters. The Federalists realized they had to mobilize their popular vote, so they mobilized their newspapers, held rallies, counted votes, and especially relied on the prestige of President Washington. The contest over the Jay Treaty marked the first flowering of grassroots political activism in America, directed and coordinated by two national parties. Politics was no longer the domain of politicians; every voter was called on to participate. The new strategy of appealing directly to the public worked for the Federalists; public opinion shifted to support the Jay Treaty. [...] The Federalists controlled the Senate and they ratified it by exactly the necessary ⅔ vote, 20-10, in 1795. However, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> did not give up and public opinion swung toward <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> after <b>the</b> Treaty fight; and in the South the Federalists lost most of the support they had among planters.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that there have been differing constructed narratives of this rebellion due to the problematic political alignments involved in the Cambodian struggle. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> government <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> portray <b>the</b> Cambodian revolutionary movement as largely a foreign (mainly Vietnamese) transplant and preferred to gloss over the significance of indigenous leftist activity from 1967. Alternatively, F.U.N.K.(National United Front of Kampuchea) <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate unity between Sihanouk supporters and the Khmer Rouge, understating the extent of the development of the revolutionary opposition to Sihanouk before his overthrow.|$|R

The intense debate over the Jay Treaty in 1794–1795 transformed those opposed to Hamilton's policies from a loose movement into a true political party. To fight the treaty, the Jeffersonians [...] "established coordination in activity between leaders at the capital, and leaders, actives and popular followings in the states, counties and towns". However, they were defeated when Washington mobilized public opinion {{in favor of the}} treaty.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> gradual {{extinction}} of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor {{was superior to}} slave labor. Southern leaders said <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and challenged their autonomy. With the 1860 presidential victory of Abraham Lincoln, seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded.|$|R
25|$|In March 1801, {{weeks after}} the {{election}} of 1800 was resolved, two amendments were proposed in the New York state legislature that would form the skeleton of the Twelfth Amendment. Governor John Jay submitted to the state legislature an amendment that would require district election of electors in each state and Jedidiah Peck, {{a member of the}} lower house, submitted an amendment to adopt designation for the votes for President and Vice President. The two amendments were not considered until early 1802, as the state legislature took a break for the summer and winter. New York state senator DeWitt Clinton moved for the adoption of the amendment in January 1802 and shortly thereafter won a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was instrumental in bringing the designation amendment to Congress. The process continued in New York on February 15, when Representative Benjamin Walker of New York proposed the designation and district election amendments to the House. Debate on the amendments began in May and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> quickly decide on the amendments and go home for the summer, while the Federalists argued that these ideas needed much more time than allowed for in the current session. Federalist Samuel W. Dana of Connecticut wanted an examination of the necessity of a Vice President. The amendment ultimately failed in the New York State Senate, but DeWitt Clinton was able to bring amendment talks to the House.|$|R
25|$|President Lincoln was {{the leader}} of <b>the</b> {{moderate}} <b>Republicans</b> and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> speed up Reconstruction and reunite the nation painlessly and quickly. Lincoln formally began Reconstruction in late 1863 with his Ten percent plan, which went into operation in several states but which Radical Republicans opposed. Lincoln pocket vetoed the Radical plan, the Wade–Davis Bill of 1864, which was much more strict than the Ten-Percent Plan.|$|R
2500|$|The Republic's {{decision}} to move against Teruel was motivated by several strategic priorities. Republican military leaders thought that Teruel was not strongly held and sought to regain the initiative through its capture. By 1937, the Teruel salient {{was similar to the}} fingernail on a fat finger of Nationalist territory inserted into Republican Spain, and its capture would shorten the lines of communication between central Republican Spain and Valencia on the coast. Teruel was surrounded on three sides by Republican Spain. In addition, Teruel was a symbol of Nationalist power on the Aragon Front. [...] Indalecio Prieto, Republican Minister of War, wanted a spectacular victory to reflect well on his tenure in the war department and to show how the army could function under his reorganization. [...] A victory at Teruel would also aid the government of Prime Minister Juan Negrín in its quest to take over the industries of Catalonia from their workers. Lastly, Republican intelligence learned that Franco intended to start a major offensive against Madrid in the Guadalajara sector on 18 December, leading <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> divert <b>the</b> Nationalists away from the Madrid area. The Republic therefore started the battle on 15 December.|$|R

2500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Face the Nation, Wasserman Schultz said, [...] "The Republicans {{have a plan to}} end Medicare as we know it. What they would do is they would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, 'You know what? You're on your own. Go and find private health insurance in the health-care insurance market.. Four non-partisan fact-checkers called her claim false. She then came under criticism for her comments on Washington Watch with Roland Martin, in which she said, [...] "You have <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> literally drag us {{all the way back to}} Jim Crow laws and literally—and very transparently—block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than <b>Republican</b> candidates". <b>The</b> next day, she stated that [...] "Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use".|$|R
50|$|On 16 April 1938, the Anglo-Italian pact was signed.

Franco <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> maritime commerce and destroy <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> morale and he authorized the Aviazione Legionaria and the Legion Condor to undertake indiscriminate bombings of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> cities.

50|$|Herbert Hoover was {{sufficiently}} {{embarrassed by the}} march that a full-scale investigation was launched against Cox. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know how Cox was able to purchase enough gasoline to get the marchers to Washington, suggesting the Vatican, or Democratic supporters of Al Smith funded the operation.

50|$|Washington dedicates a {{large part}} of his {{farewell}} address to discussing foreign relations and the dangers of permanent alliances between the United States and foreign nations, which he views as foreign entanglements. This issue dominated national politics during the French Revolutionary Wars between France and Britain. Federalists favored Britain and <b>the</b> Jeffersonian <b>Republicans</b> favored France. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>to</b> honor the 1778 Treaty of Alliance and to aid France, while the Federalists favored an alliance with Britain. Washington had avoided American involvement in the conflict by issuing the Proclamation of Neutrality, which in turn led to the Neutrality Act of 1794.

50|$|For {{the first}} time, {{significant}} numbers of delegates to the national conventions were elected in presidential preference primaries. Primary elections were advocated by the progressive faction of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, which <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> break the control of political parties by bosses. Altogether, twelve states held Republican primaries. Robert M. La Follette won two of the first four primaries (North Dakota and Wisconsin). Beginning with his runaway victory in Illinois on April 9, however, Roosevelt won nine of the last ten presidential primaries (in order, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Oregon, Maryland, California, Ohio, New Jersey, and South Dakota), losing only Massachusetts to Taft. As a sign of his great popularity, Roosevelt even carried Taft's home state of Ohio.|$|R
5000|$|Walters' {{prominence}} {{had grown}} to such a level that on January 10, 1916, he met with President Woodrow Wilson at the White House to discuss how best to obtain the confirmation of African-Americans nominated for federal office by Wilson. Writing to Wilson, after that meeting Walters said: [...] "After leaving the White House the idea {{occurred to me that}} {{it might be a good}} thing to see the Senators who have declared themselves opposed to the Confirmation of colored men who are nominated by yourself for office." [...] He continues; [...] "If you have not any objection, I would like to take up with the Senators the matter of Confirmation of colored men for it would greatly handicap us in the Fall Campaign and would be all <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use against us to be able to say for certainty that Democratic Senators will not confirm colored men.

5000|$|The Western allies did {{not have}} a unified {{position}} on what the Conference was to achieve in relation to Indochina. Anthony Eden, leading the British delegation, favored a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Georges Bidault, leading the French delegation, vacillated - keen to preserve something of France's position in Indochina and justify past sacrifices even as the nation's military situation deteriorated. The U.S. had been supporting the French in Indochina for many years and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Eisenhower administration <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> ensure that it could not be accused of another [...] "Yalta" [...] or having [...] "lost" [...] Indochina to the Communists.

2500|$|After the Civil War, [...] "conservative" [...] came to mean {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Radical <b>Republicans</b> who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> grant full citizenship {{rights to}} freed slaves and take political power {{away from the}} ex-Confederates. Conservative White Southerners thought that the radical experiments by Northern reformers to empower the freed slaves violated the rights of white men and they often accused Carpetbaggers who tried to help freed slaves of corruption. The race-based conservatism in the American South differed from the business-based conservatism in the North in its strong support for white supremacy, and insistence on a second-class powerless status for blacks, regardless of the Constitution. Southern conservatives in the 1950s added anti-communism to their agenda, believing that the ideology was behind {{the civil rights movement}} and the push for integration.|$|R
50|$|Martin McGartland (Jim Sturgess) is a 21-year-old street hustler from Northern Ireland, {{living in}} the late 1980s. <b>The</b> Irish <b>Republican</b> Army <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> recruit him, but he is {{reluctant}} {{because of what he}} sees as their cruel street justice. Because of his connection to the community, the British police <b>want</b> him <b>to</b> infiltrate and spy on the IRA. Marty agrees because of the car and money he gets from the police and because he despises the IRA. The IRA accepts him as a Volunteer and in that position he learns of various planned attacks. He then informs Fergus, his police contact, to prevent these attacks. He builds up a new sense of self-esteem, but he cannot tell his family and friends about his activities. Even his new girlfriend Lara (Natalie Press) only notices that he seems to do some work for the IRA, which worries her.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{perceptions}} of <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Republican</b> elites towards Arabs between 1930 and 1940. Although relations with the Arab world have attracted the interest of scholars starting with the 1980 s, the literature is quite weak regarding <b>the</b> early <b>Republican</b> period. In an attempt to fill this gap, this thesis looks at the Ulus, semi-official newspaper of <b>the</b> ruling <b>Republican</b> People’s Party at the time, to reveal both diplomatic and cultural relations between Turks and Arabs. There are three main findings of the thesis. First, as reflected by the Ulus, Turkey did not neglect the diplomatic relations as it is mostly argued. Second, peaceful relations in the diplomatic arena did not translate into cultural or identity level feelings towards the Arabs. Arabic identity was instrumentalized in order to reinforce the modern, secular and Western Turkish identity that <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> elites <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create. Third, <b>Republican</b> elites made use of domestic affairs, successes and failures, of the Arab countries in advantage of the Kemalist regime of Turkey. Failures of the Arab countries suggested the relative success of the Kemalist regime, which was modern, secular and Western oriented. In case of successes of the Arab countries, Turkey was shown as the role model for these Arab countries. This thesis {{is important in the}} sense that it brings more nuanced analysis of the relations at the time and reveals the perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> elites towards Arabs through the stereotypes they used...|$|R
