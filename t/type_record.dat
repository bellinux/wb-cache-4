40|$|Abstract. <b>Record</b> <b>types</b> are an {{important}} tool for programming and dependent <b>record</b> <b>types</b> are proven to be very useful for program specification and verification. Unfortunately all known embedding of the dependent <b>record</b> <b>type</b> in the type theory had some imperfections. In this paper we present a new type constructor, dependent intersection [...] the intersection of two types, where the second type may depend on the first type (this is not {{the intersection of the}} family of types). This new type constructor allows us to define records that combine the most advantages of previously known approaches, while avoiding most of their disadvantages. 1 Introduction Over the last decade <b>record</b> <b>types</b> and especially the dependent <b>record</b> <b>types</b> (or more formally dependently <b>typed</b> <b>records)</b> proved to be an extremely useful program specifications and verification tool [7, 3, 11]. There are several approaches of defining <b>record</b> <b>types.</b> Probably the most straightforward way of adding <b>records</b> to the <b>type</b> theory is to add them as a new primitive type. This approach was taken for example in [8]. Unfortunately, if this approach is taken, the theory needs to be extended with the numerous new rules describing the properties of <b>record</b> <b>types,</b> operations on <b>record</b> <b>types,</b> properties of <b>record</b> objects, operations on record objects, etc. This creates a very complicated theory that is not very intuitive and thus hard reason in and about...|$|R

5000|$|I felt very, {{very upset}} with the way people treated each other last year, when we were writing, {{and a lot of}} that came out as anger. It made me feel a lot better to sing about it, and a lot of what was said really needed to be said by someone, even if I didn't. Even if my main message that people get is 'I don't know what's going on but I think you're all dicks... does anyone else feel like this?', that's {{important}} as no one was saying even that. Everyone was just letting it all go on, only saying 'ooh, isn't it terrible?', but not engaging or trying to understand why these things were happening, or not even having an opinion about our role in all of it. I just felt like I needed to say something, even if that is on a poppy-indie <b>type</b> <b>record.</b> Perhaps that's not the best way to do it, but I have that platform, so it's the one I used. Jonathan Higgs on the album's lyrics, in an interview with The Line of Best Fit The album's themes revolve around the current affairs of 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the British media's handling of the United Kingdom general election, as well as on the state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent [...] "watching rolling news" [...] and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of and violence, you've got rolling news and you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{review of}} {{paleoclimate}} information for New Zealand {{pertaining to the}} past 30, 000 years has identified a general sequence of climatic events, spanning the onset of cold conditions marking {{the final phase of}} the Last Glaciation, through to the emergence to full interglacial conditions in the early Holocene. In order to facilitate more detailed assessments of climate variability and any leads or lags in the timing of climate changes across the region, a composite stratotype is proposed for New Zealand. The stratotype is based on terrestrial stratigraphic records and is intended to provide a standard reference for the intercomparison and evaluation of climate proxy records. We nominate a specific stratigraphic <b>type</b> <b>record</b> for each climatic event, using either natural exposure or drill core stratigraphic sections. Type records were {{selected on the basis of}} having very good numerical age control and a clear proxy record. In all cases the main proxy of the <b>type</b> <b>record</b> is subfossil pollen. The <b>type</b> <b>record</b> for the period from ca 30 to ca 18 calendar kiloyears BP (cal. ka BP) is designated in lake-bed sediments from a small morainic kettle lake (Galway tarn) in western South Island. The Galway tarn <b>type</b> <b>record</b> spans a period of full glacial conditions (Last Glacial Coldest Period, LGCP) within the Otira Glaciation, and includes three cold stadials separated by two cool interstadials. The <b>type</b> <b>record</b> for the emergence from glacial conditions following the termination of the Last Glaciation (post-Termination amelioration) is in a core of lake sediments from a maar (Pukaki volcanic crater) in Auckland, northern North Island, and spans from ca 18 to 15. 64 ± 0. 41 cal. ka BP. The <b>type</b> <b>record</b> for the Lateglacial period is an exposure of interbedded peat and mud at montane Kaipo bog, eastern North Island. In this high-resolution <b>type</b> <b>record,</b> an initial mild period was succeeded at 13. 74 ± 0. 13 cal. ka BP by a cooler period, which after 12. 55 ± 0. 14 cal. ka BP gave way to a progressive ascent to full interglacial conditions that were achieved by 11. 88 ± 0. 18 cal. ka BP. Although a type section is not formally designated for the Holocene Interglacial (11. 88 ± 0. 18 cal. ka BP to the present day), the sedimentary record of Lake Maratoto on the Waikato lowlands, northwestern North Island, is identified as a prospective type section pending the integration and updating of existing stratigraphic and proxy datasets, and age models. The type records are interconnected by one or more dated tephra layers, the ages of which are derived from Bayesian depositional modelling and OxCal-based calibrations using the IntCal 09 dataset. Along with the type sections and the Lake Maratoto record, important, well-dated terrestrial reference records are provided for each climate event. Climate proxies from these reference records include pollen flora, stable isotopes from speleothems, beetle and chironomid fauna, and glacier moraines. The regional composite stratotype provides a benchmark against which to compare other records and proxies. Based on the composite stratotype, we provide an updated climate event stratigraphic classification for the New Zealand region. The stratotype and event classification are not intended to act as definitive statements of paleoclimate history for the New Zealand region, but rather provide a firm baseline against which to compare other records including those from the marine realm...|$|E
