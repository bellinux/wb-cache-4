40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} {{have long}} been used {{in a wide variety}} of industrial applications, such as for energy recovery from by-products, temperature regulation in chemical processes, refrigeration, or cooling of car engines. Typically, each application requires a different type of heat exchanger such as, <b>tube,</b> <b>shell,</b> with/without phase change, mixing/non mixing etc. heat exchangers. Due to their importance, there has been an ongoing interest in reducing the perational/constructional costs and increasing the efficiency. A lot of research has be done in optimizing certain features of heat exchangers (e. g. tube dimensions, fin thickness etc.), but so far none of them investigates the optimization of the whole topology of a heat exchanger. The aim of this thesis is to optimize the structure of a two flow heat exchanger, by means of topology optimization. More specifically we aim to maximize the efficiency of heat transfer, given some predefined pressure drop and dimension constraints. These constraints are necessitated by the need of achieving a reduced operating (pressure drop) and manufacturing dimensions) costs. A heat exchanger, being a multi-physics system, can be described by two physical phenomena: the flow of the fluid and the heat transfer. In this study we focus on heat exchanger governed by an isothermal and incompressible Stokes flow with low Reynolds number, while the heat transfer is assumed to be advective-conductive heat transfer, without internal heat generation, characterised by a relatively high Peclet number. We evaluate two novel models for topology optimization of heat exchangers; the Fluid Tracking Model and the Multi-Material Model. Throughout the experimental evaluation we saw that the Multi-Material Model performs best. The Fluid Tracking Model did not produce optimal results and was unable to enforce non-mixing designs. The Multi-Material Model optimized designs that maximized the heat transfer surface area between the fluids. Furthermore the designs illustrated a wall at the interfaces of the two fluids, keeping the two flows separated. Both 2 D and 3 D cases were studied. The 3 D optimal results achieved a moderate improvement in performance over a simple design of a concentric tube heat exchanger.

Thus, there are additional parameters to be specified such as wall thickness of <b>tubes</b> and <b>shell,</b> form and arrangement of tubes, coolant flow circuit. Simultaneously with the thermal-hydraulic calculation and estimate of HE weight-size parameters, as a whole, tube opening angles are optimized and a problem of splitter baffle to be in them is solved. In the context of simple calculation of air-to-air recuperative heat exchanger with a cross (one-way) circuit coolant flow and plate-fin heat exchange surfaces with short plate fin (PlR 1 - PlR 12) are compared different methods for the HE weight-size optimization. It is shown that the techniques and algorithms using natural (size, area of heat transfer, mass) characteristics or derivatives (cubic coefficient) of the HE matrix, as the optimization criteria of variants calculation, provide only a very rough estimate of the HE weight-size characteristics, as a whole. Their use may result in non-optimal choice (in mass and size) of the HE model that when using in aviation and space technology leads to an additionally increasing mass of the aircraft.
