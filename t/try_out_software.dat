40|$|As new software-testing {{techniques}} are developed, {{and before they}} can achieve widespread acceptance, their effectiveness at detecting defects must be evaluated. The most common way to evaluate testing techniques is with empirical studies, in which one or more {{techniques are}} <b>tried</b> <b>out</b> on <b>software</b> with known defects. However, the defects used can affect {{the performance of the}} techniques. To complicate matters, it is not even clear how to effectively describe or characterize defects. To address these problems, this work describes an experiment architecture for empirically evaluating testing techniques, which takes both defect and test-suite characteristics into account. As proof of concept, an experiment on GUI-testing techniques is conducted. It provides evidence that the defect characteristics proposed do help explain defect detection, at least for GUI testing, and it explores the relationship between the coverage of defective code and the detection of defects...|$|R

40|$|The {{need to use}} {{technology}} to assist students in learning languages including English is undeniable. With its abilities, technology could help students learn English easily and effectively. One of the uses of technology in English learning is computer program. With its advantages, computer software can promote reading, writing, listening, grammar and vocabulary learning. Vocabulary software is one of computer-based software that has been widely used for young learners. However, the availability of vocabulary software in the market still needs developing, especially in Santo Yosef Elementary School in Surabaya. The vocabulary software in schools are limited on learning words in isolation accompanied with pictures, bilingual words (English – Indonesian) accompanied with pictures, and picture dictionaries. In these types of vocabulary software students do not have opportunities to learn words used in context (sentences). Learning words in isolation is not effective. Therefore, this study aimed at developing vocabulary software which provides {{opportunities for students to}} learn words in context so that they know how the words are used appropriately and {{will be able to use}} the words appropriately as well. The vocabulary software under this study was developed using ADDIE instructional design model, namely: (1) Analysis, (2) Design, (3) Develop, (4) Implement, and (5) Evaluate. The software was evaluated by experts, and was revised based on the experts’ feedback, comments, and suggestions. After being revised, the <b>software</b> was <b>tried</b> <b>out</b> to the students through a series of try out: individuals, a small group, and a large group (field <b>try</b> <b>out).</b> After each <b>try</b> <b>out,</b> the <b>software</b> was revised based on the results of the tryout. Based on the result of the final <b>try</b> <b>out,</b> it can be concluded that the developed software can be used as an appropriate supplementary vocabulary learning material for the students of Santo Yosef Catholic Elementary School in Surabaya...|$|R

In this research, the writer uses vocabulary test and reading comprehension test as the instrument. These tests are used to measure the students’ English vocabulary mastery and students’ reading comprehension. Before the research conducted, the writer <b>tries</b> <b>out</b> the instrument. The <b>try</b> <b>out</b> was conducted to know the validity and the reliability of the instrument. There are 40 respondents from class XII IPA 2 who join the <b>try</b> <b>out.</b> After that the writer computes the data of <b>try</b> <b>out</b> uses SPSS <b>software.</b> Based on the result of the data computation, the writer concludes that both of the instruments are valid and reliable. After conducting the <b>try</b> <b>out,</b> the writer hold the test to the students for the research. There are 18 students from 3 of science classes of the third year students of SMA Negeri 1 Grobogan which chosen by using multi-stage cluster random sampling who join the test. After the data collected, the writer computes them uses correlation product moment formula. The statistical data analysis shows that the obtained rxy is 0, 714 while the rtable is 0, 468 at the level of significant 0, 5. It means that the obtained rxy is higher than rtable, because the obtained rxy 0, 714 is positive. So, there is a positive correlation between the English vocabulary mastery and reading comprehension of the third year students of SMA Negeri 1 Grobogan. Based on the result of the research finding, the writer concludes that the mastery of vocabulary has to be possessed by the students in order that they get the reading comprehension. The correlation also indicates that the better a student master the English vocabulary the better he/she can enjoy his reading well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Today’s {{increasing}} {{diversity in}} multicore hardware challenges programmers {{when it comes}} to software performance optimization and portability. As multicore processors are in almost every PC and server, programmers now have to parallelize a larger spectrum of applications, many of which are non-numerical. To obtain good performance, programmers typi-cally <b>try</b> <b>out</b> different <b>software</b> tuning parameter configurations on each platform. However, this manual approach to finding good configurations in the search space is impractical due to combinatorial explosion, but yet it is common practice due to lack of alternatives for general programs. This paper presents a smarter way to tackle this problem algorithmically for a variety of multicore applications, including non-numerical ones. Our work introduces AutoTunium, a novel feedback-directed optimizer that automates the application tuning process with evolutionary search strategies. The software infrastructure is easy to use and integrated in the popular Eclipse environment. It collects run-time information to predict parameter configurations that are likely to lead to good performance in future runs, and configures programs for production runs in the best possible way. We quantify the effectiveness of various tuning strategies on a diverse set of real applications and multicore platforms. The evaluation shows that AutoTunium’s evolutionary strategies work well despite the broad scope of applications and perform better in this context than other simplex-based search algorithms. Our insights are derived from model-based analyses as well as from performance analyses with real programs in the PARSEC benchmark suite...|$|R
40|$|The {{teaching}} and learning of Reading in Gloria Christian Junior High School is felt to be less optimal in {{the achievement of the}} students taking the subject. Scores achieved by the students are constantly declining along with their motivation to study. This is caused by some factors. It might be caused by the teaching techniques that do not encourage students to learn more in the subject but only doing tasks and exercises. Another factor is the boredom suffered by the students concerning the passages they are to understand with the bundles of exercises that follow them. However, the main problem is that the learning resources for learning Reading are still limited on textbooks, and a more motivating resource is still rare to use. Moreover, textbooks usually do not put attention on students’ individual learning capability. This kind of learning resource does not make the student learn. In accordance to this problem, it is salient {{to find a way to}} solve the problem. Since this problem is mostly caused by the limitation of learning resources, an alternative learning resource, which can motivate and ease the students in learning, can be an option. Fulfilling the requirement of motivating and easy learning resources, Computer-Aided Language Learning which enhances individual achievement, is considered to be effective to cope with the problem. Based on the background stated above, the objective of this development is to produce CALL software for teaching Reading. In developing the software, components that are considered as capable to make students learn more are inserted. To complete and ensure the need of having this as an alternative solution, needs assessment onto the students of Gloria Junior High School is to take into part and resulted in underlining the need of having CALL software as an alternative learning resources especially for Reading Comprehension. There are procedures in developing the Software, which includes: (1) preparation, (2) developing the software, (3) producing the software, (4) organizing documentation, and (5) testing and revising the product. For having an effective development product, evaluation and <b>try</b> <b>outs</b> on the product were conducted. The evaluation was given by experts on computer and experts on English subject. The evaluated product was then <b>tried</b> <b>out</b> to the individual <b>try</b> <b>out,</b> group <b>try</b> <b>out</b> and field <b>try</b> <b>out.</b> As a conclusion, based on the evaluations, revisions, and <b>try</b> <b>outs,</b> this CALL <b>software</b> is effective for an alternative resource in learning reading, in which it enhances student’s motivation and individual achievement, especially for the students learning Reading in the third grade of Gloria Christian Junior High School Surabaya...|$|R
