5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> tracts or <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> chiasm of <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|Damage to <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve (II) affects {{specific}} {{aspects of}} vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E

5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} is below <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies {{just above the}} diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss {{on one side of the}} visual field occurs.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} {{around the}} brain may rise, causing papilledema (swelling of <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> disc) {{which may be}} experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised intracranial pressure, the level of consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.|$|E
5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light that hits the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to the}} visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> radiation to reach the visual cortex.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} fish and {{amphibians}} possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary input from the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E

5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system.

5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2008 crisis, scholars have begun to revise their conceptions of how market participants interact. While the traditional “rationalist optic” posits market participants who are able to process decisionrelevant information and thereby transform uncertainty into quantifiable risks, the increasingly popular “sociological optic” stresses the role of uncertainty in expectation formation and social conventions for creating confidence in markets. Applications of <b>the</b> sociological <b>optic</b> to concrete regulatory problems are still limited. By subjecting both optics to the same regulatory problem—the role of credit rating agencies (CRAs) and their ratings in capital markets—this paper provides insights into whether <b>the</b> sociological <b>optic</b> offers advice to tackle concrete regulatory problems and discusses the potential of <b>the</b> sociological <b>optic</b> in complementing <b>the</b> rationalist <b>optic.</b> <b>The</b> empirical application suggests that <b>the</b> sociological <b>optic</b> is not only able to improve our understanding of the role of CRAs and their ratings, but also to provide solutions complementary to those posited by <b>the</b> rationalist <b>optic...</b>|$|R

5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|Some animals mimic <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> {{flow of the}} background, so {{that the}} {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E

5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called <b>the</b> <b>optic</b> chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>optic</b> tectum allows {{actions to}} be {{directed}} toward points in space, most commonly in response to visual input.

It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain. The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.|$|E
