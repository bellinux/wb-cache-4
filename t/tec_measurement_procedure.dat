The installation of GPS receivers on board of LEO (Low Earth Orbiting) satellites such as CHAMP and SAC-C offers new opportunities of ionospheric remote sensing.

30|$|Due to its fixed {{location}} and priority to other applications, ionospheric observations with ALTAIR are limited. Therefore, current research efforts include {{the development of}} adequate ways of specifying the variability of the bottomside F-region ionosphere at low latitudes (Saito and Maruyama 2007; Thampi et al. 2009; Tulasi Ram et al. 2012). Ongoing research efforts also include obtaining observational evidence of the causal relationship between the initial perturbations and ESF development (Tulasi Ram et al. 2014). The only other low-latitude incoherent scatter radar, located at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in Peru, does not have steering capability and therefore cannot provide unambiguous observations of the bottomside electron density disturbances. Recent observational efforts have focused on obtaining information about these waves from their signatures in the total electron content (<b>TEC)</b> <b>measurements</b> (Thampi et al. 2009; Tulasi Ram et al. 2014).

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 49 - 53. Ionosphere {{region of}} Earth’s upper atmosphere ranging from 90 km to 1000 km altitude, {{has a significant}} effect on military and civilian communications, satellite communications and positioning systems. Solar, geomagnetic, gravitational and seismic activities cause variations in the electron distribution of the atmosphere. The number of electrons within a vertical column of 1 m 2 cross section, which is called as Total Electron Content (TEC), is a measurable feature of the ionosphere that provides valuable information about the ionosphere. TEC can be measured fast and accurately by using the phase difference between transmitted satellite positioning signals such as in the Global Positioning System (GPS). To investigate the reliability of earthquake prediction based on detection of local ionospheric anomalies, <b>TEC</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained from a network of GPS receivers over a period of 2 years in 2010 and 2011 are used to generate detection signals. For a day of interest, after selecting a receiver station surrounding GPS stations that are located within 150 km of the chosen station used to estimate <b>TEC</b> <b>measurements</b> at the chosen station. In one of the proposed techniques, detection of ionospheric anomalies is based on distance between measured TEC and its estimate. Detection threshold is obtained based on statistical variation of this distance for the days with insignificant seismic activities. Also, another detection technique based on temporal variation of <b>TEC</b> <b>measurements</b> is proposed. Both individual and fused detection performances of these techniques are investigated for a given level of false alarms.

30|$|We {{used the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) PyIono package (a bias-fixing algorithm) to {{generate}} high-precision calibrated <b>TEC</b> <b>measurements.</b> Calibrating <b>TEC</b> <b>measurements</b> serves multiple purposes for us including quality checking (QC) of processed data, leveling the phase measurements using pseudoranges and comparing modeled TEC perturbations with measured ones. Obtaining absolute TEC values {{is useful to}} understand background conditions for the perturbations. However, we are primarily interested in monitoring small-scale variations in ionospheric electron density, hence the changes in TEC are of interest, rather than absolute TEC values. The processing algorithm was first described in Komjathy et al. (2005). We estimate highly precise satellite and receiver interfrequency biases using about 200 GPS receivers distributed worldwide (e.g., Mannucci et al., 1998, 2004). The output of this Kalman-filter-based least-squares estimation scheme serves as the background ionosphere for the later part of the estimation technique. In {{the second part of}} the processing, we use the 200 -station-based ionosphere solution to correct measurements from the remaining stations for the ionospheric contribution. In summary, we remove all the unknowns from the observation equation, and subsequently solve for the receiver differential biases directly. The remaining error sources are the multipath and receiver noise contributions, and the ionospheric mapping error (discussed further in Komjathy et al. (2005)).|$|R
