5|$|Dhondup Wangchen (born 17 October 1974) is a <b>Tibetan</b> filmmaker {{imprisoned by}} the Chinese {{government}} in 2008 on charges {{related to his}} documentary Leaving Fear Behind. Made with senior <b>Tibetan</b> monk Jigme Gyatso, the documentary consists of interviews with ordinary <b>Tibetan</b> people discussing the 14th Dalai Lama, the Chinese government, the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and Han Chinese migrants to the region. After smuggling the tapes of the interviews out of Tibet, however, Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso were detained during the 2008 <b>Tibetan</b> unrest.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} {{of human rights}} and <b>Tibetan</b> activist groups calling for Dhondup Wangchen's release held a rally in New York City's Times Square on 9 March 2012, the day before <b>Tibetan</b> Uprising Day. Speakers included Dhondup Wangchen's wife Lhamo Tso as well as poet-activist Tenzin Tsundue. Excerpts from Leaving Fear Behind were shown on a twelve-foot video screen beneath the Xinhua Jumbotron.|$|E
5|$|According to Tibetologist John Powers, <b>Tibetan</b> sources counter this {{narrative}} of titles {{granted by the}} Chinese to Tibetans with various titles which the Tibetans gave to the Chinese emperors and their officials. Tribute missions from <b>Tibetan</b> monasteries to the Chinese court brought back not only titles, but large, commercially valuable gifts which could subsequently be sold. The Ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas, but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves, and no <b>Tibetan</b> ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the Ming.|$|E
50|$|After <b>Tibetans</b> {{attacked}} the Ninghai Muslim army in 1922 and 1923, the Ninghai army returned in 1924 and crushed the <b>Tibetans,</b> killing numerous <b>Tibetans.</b>|$|R
25|$|The government, in turn, rejects {{claims that}} the lives of <b>Tibetans</b> have deteriorated, and states that the lives of <b>Tibetans</b> have been {{improved}} immensely compared to self-rule before 1950. Despite China's {{claims that the}} lives of <b>Tibetans</b> have improved immensely, a 2004 book claimed some 3,000 <b>Tibetans</b> brave hardship and danger to flee into exile every year. In addition, Human Rights Watch reports continued widespread abuses committed by Chinese security forces and torture by Chinese police and security forced.|$|R
25|$|Medieval Muslim writers {{noted that}} <b>Tibetans</b> and Turks resembled {{each other and}} often {{were not able to}} tell the {{difference}} between Turks and <b>Tibetans.</b>|$|R
5|$|In late October 2010, {{in order}} to protest the {{government}} over the language policy in <b>Tibetan</b> area, the <b>Tibetan</b> Youth Congress (TYC) used the games as a channel to voice their concern.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} Chinese medicine cubeb is {{used for}} its alleged warming property. In <b>Tibetan</b> medicine, cubeb (ka ko la in <b>Tibetan)</b> is one of bzang po drug, six fine herbs beneficial to specific organs in the body, with cubeb assigned to the spleen.|$|E
5|$|Namtso {{is one of}} {{the great}} lakes of the <b>Tibetan</b> plateau.|$|E
50|$|At Ganjia and Serchentang, General Ma Bufang {{defeated}} <b>Tibetans</b> under Gonpo Dondrup on 27 June 1924 and 25-27 April 1925. The <b>Tibetans</b> suffered severe casualties.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>Tibetans</b> {{who live in}} Dêqên and they, {{compared}} to <b>Tibetans</b> in Tibet, have had longer-lasting trade relations with Han-Chinese and other ethnic minorities.|$|R
50|$|Islam {{was spread}} by the Salar {{people to the}} {{formerly}} Buddhist Kargan <b>Tibetans</b> in Lamo-shan-ken. Some <b>Tibetans</b> in Qinghai who converted to Islam are now considered Hui people.|$|R
5|$|Nyêmo County has China's first {{museum of}} <b>Tibetan</b> text.|$|E
5|$|The Ming court {{appointed}} three Princes of Dharma (法王) {{and five}} Princes (王), and granted many other titles, such as Grand State Tutors (大國師) and State Tutors (國師), to the important schools of <b>Tibetan</b> Buddhism, including the Karma Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug. According to Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, leading officials of these organs were all {{appointed by the}} central government and were subject {{to the rule of}} law. Yet Van Praag describes the distinct and long-lasting <b>Tibetan</b> law code established by the Phagmodru ruler Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen as one of many reforms to revive old Imperial <b>Tibetan</b> traditions.|$|E
5|$|The Tang Empire {{competed with}} the <b>Tibetan</b> Empire {{for control of}} areas in Inner and Central Asia, which was at times settled with {{marriage}} alliances such as the marrying of Princess Wencheng (d.680) to Songtsän Gampo (d. 649). A <b>Tibetan</b> tradition mentions that Chinese troops captured Lhasa after Songtsän Gampo's death, but no such invasion is mentioned in either Chinese annals or the <b>Tibetan</b> manuscripts of Dunhuang.|$|E
50|$|After {{escaping}} from Lingtu, the <b>Tibetans</b> {{crossed the border}} and rallied in the Chumbi valley, defeated but not destroyed. In fact they received reinforcements and the British readied their defences in Gnathong, a plateau some three or four miles north of Lingtu. On 21May the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal arrived at Gnathong and the <b>Tibetans</b> attacked the British defences {{the next day at}} 7 AM with 3,000 men (British claim). The fighting lasted until 10 a.m. when the <b>Tibetans</b> retreated. The British admitted three killed and eight wounded and claimed to have killed around a hundred <b>Tibetans.</b> The <b>Tibetans</b> retreated back across the Jelap La and no other combat took place, so in June the British started to send some of the troops back to Darjeeling.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to modern Han populations, modern <b>Tibetans</b> show greater genetic affinity for Denisovans; however, both the Han and <b>Tibetans</b> have similar ratios of genetic affinity for general Neanderthal populations.|$|R
50|$|The Tang dynasty became {{weakened}} considerably {{due to the}} An Lushan Rebellion, and the <b>Tibetans</b> {{took the}} opportunity to expand into Gansu and the Western Regions. The <b>Tibetans</b> took control of Turfan in 792.|$|R
5|$|The site, {{which is}} over 1,300 years old, {{dates back to}} Songtsän Gampo, {{the founder of the}} <b>Tibetan</b> Empire, and was amongst the first {{buildings}} built in the Lhasa area by him during the 7th century after settlement. Although originally the site of his castle or fort, the <b>Tibetan</b> Annals have revealed that Pabonka was converted into a monastery, possibly under the reign of the second great Buddhist king of Tibet Trisong Detsen. Detsen, along with Guru Rinpoche and the first seven monks of the new <b>Tibetan</b> Empire used to meditate at the hermitage and it became one of Tibet's very earliest Buddhist monasteries, possibly even pre-dating Jokhang.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tibetan</b> Buddhism {{would become}} a {{pervasive}} influence {{on the lives of}} the people.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 book {{estimated}} {{that up to}} two-thirds of the city's residents are non-Tibetan, although the government states that Chengguan District {{as a whole is}} still 63% ethnic <b>Tibetan.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tibetans</b> are phenotypically diverse. Recent {{research}} into the ability of Tibetans' metabolism to function normally in the oxygen-deficient atmosphere above 4400 m shows that, although <b>Tibetans</b> living at high altitudes have no more oxygen in their blood than other people, they have ten times more nitric oxide and double the forearm blood flow of low-altitude dwellers. <b>Tibetans</b> inherited this adaptation thanks to their denisovan admixture. Nitric oxide causes dilation of blood vessels allowing blood to flow more freely to the extremities and aids the release of oxygen to tissues. This and other advantages in physiological function at high altitudes {{have been attributed to}} a mutation in the EPAS1 gene among <b>Tibetans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thorns {{were used}} by the <b>Tibetans</b> to whip Father Mussot, a French Priest, and his severed hands and heads were affixed to a monastery door after the <b>Tibetans</b> shot him to death. Methods of {{execution}} such as encasing victims in yak skins which were then sewn shut and left out {{to be exposed to}} the elements were used upon Christians by the <b>Tibetans.</b> The <b>Tibetans</b> executed Father Soulié, and took to the Atunze monastery the head and liver of Bourdonnec after they slayed him and Dubernard, and they vowed [...] "to exterminate all inhabitants ... even the dogs and chickens, up to the least blade of grass.".|$|R
50|$|The rapid {{economic}} development of the T.A.R. has brought about a revival of traditional handicrafts. Many <b>Tibetans</b> today draw {{a significant part of}} their income from selling handicraft and cultural products to tourists, or even to other <b>Tibetans.</b>|$|R
5|$|About 90% of {{the people}} were ethnic <b>Tibetan,</b> with most people of other {{ethnicity}} living in Donggar.|$|E
5|$|After 649, the Tang Dynasty {{continued}} their {{war against the}} Western Turks under the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Taizong's successor. Gaozong conducted a campaign led by general Su Dingfang against the Western Turk qaghan, Ashina Helu in 657. The qaghan surrendered, the Western Turks were defeated, and the khaganate's former territories were annexed by the Tang. The Tang retreated from beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan after a Turkic revolt in 662, and lost the Tarim Basin to local revolts and <b>Tibetan</b> incursions in 665-670. The Tang regained the Tarim Basin in 692 and again lost it to the Tibetans in the 790s, the Four Garrisons having already been {{cut off from the}} rest of the Tang empire by a <b>Tibetan</b> conquest of the Gansu Corridor. Although the <b>Tibetan</b> empire collapsed in the middle of the ninth century, the Tang Dynasty lacked the means to regain dominance in the Tarim Basin and itself ended in 907 with the abdication of Emperor Ai.|$|E
5|$|After this, the <b>Tibetan</b> people's {{trade in}} tiger skins became a {{relatively}} more important threat to tigers. The pelts {{were used in}} clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn by singers and participants in horse racing festivals, and had become status symbols. In 2004, international conservation organizations launched successful environmental propaganda campaigns in China against the <b>Tibetan</b> tiger skin trade. There was outrage in India, where many Tibetans live, and the 14th Dalai Lama was persuaded {{to take up the}} issue. Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1980s, <b>Tibetans</b> {{have begun}} to restore those monasteries that survived. This has become an {{international}} effort. Experts are teaching the <b>Tibetans</b> how to restore the building and save the remaining monasteries on the eastern plateau.|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of {{reinforcements}} from Galdan Boshugtu Khan, Khan of the Zungar Empire, the <b>Tibetans</b> attacked again in 1684. The <b>Tibetans</b> were victorious and concluded a treaty with Ladakh then they retreated back to Lhasa on December 1684.|$|R
5000|$|Released in 2004, {{the film}} raised {{controversy}} for showing {{the faces of}} 103 <b>Tibetans</b> speaking about human rights. <b>Tibetans</b> were informed {{of the purpose of}} the filming. The ones who appear made the choice to participate despite the risks.|$|R
5|$|Between August 2007 to March 2008, Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso {{gathered}} interviews from 108 <b>Tibetan</b> individuals {{discussing the}} political situation, {{all of whom}} agreed to have their faces shown on camera. The pair gathered 40 hours of interview footage shot by a single camera. They had completed filming and just smuggled the tapes out of Lhasa, the <b>Tibetan</b> capital, when riots erupted and began to spread through Tibetan-majority areas of China. As {{part of the government}} response that followed, both Jigme Gyatso and Dhondup Wangchen were detained on 28 March in Tong De, Qinghai Province.|$|E
5|$|From the 11th century, many <b>Tibetan</b> {{saints and}} eminent figures came to Taktsang to meditate, {{including}} Milarepa (1040–1123), Pha Dampa Sangye (died 1117), the <b>Tibetan</b> yogini Machig Labdrön (1055–1145) and Thangton Gyelpo (1385–1464). In {{the latter part}} of the 12th century, the Lapa School was established in Paro. Between 12th and 17th centuries, many Lamas who came from Tibet established their monasteries in Bhutan.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Dhondup Wangchen {{and friend}} Jigme Gyatso, a senior <b>Tibetan</b> monk, {{conceived}} of a documentary interviewing ordinary <b>Tibetan</b> {{people on their}} views of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government in the year {{leading up to the}} 2008 Beijing Olympics. The documentary was to be called Leaving Fear Behind. The pair coordinated their efforts with a Dhondup Wangchen's cousin Gyaljong Tsetrin, who remained in Switzerland. In preparation for likely reprisals by the Chinese government, Dhondup Wangchen moved his wife, Llamo Tso, and their four children to Dharamsala, India.|$|E
50|$|ICT {{advocacy}} {{efforts are}} focused on securing humanitarian and development assistance for <b>Tibetans,</b> and working with governments to develop policies and programs to help <b>Tibetans.</b> ICT asks its members to petition governments on behalf of Tibet, and organizes activities like the annual Tibet Lobby Day which gives constituents a chance to directly ask their representatives to help Tibet. Additional advocacy efforts {{are focused on}} achieving the release of <b>Tibetans</b> imprisoned for their political or religious beliefs.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2009, 40,000 <b>Tibetans</b> in Tenzin Delek Rinpoche's home area {{signed a}} {{petition}} {{asking for a}} re-trial. They staged a hunger strike at the county seat of Lithang for a few days, {{which led to the}} temporary arrest of about 70 <b>Tibetans.</b>|$|R
25|$|According to writer Rebecca French, <b>Tibetans</b> viewed {{criminal}} offenses as uncommon, {{but there}} are few records to establish frequency. However, <b>Tibetans</b> also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes. Because it was considered harsh by most <b>Tibetans,</b> they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials {{were also more likely}} to find peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution.|$|R
