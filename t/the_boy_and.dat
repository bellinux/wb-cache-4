5|$|The duo finally {{returns to}} Omnitopia and finds Ruffleberg, who {{explains}} everything. He and his butler Carltron once engaged in chess matches. Ruffleberg outfitted {{him with an}} intelligence chip {{to make him a}} more challenging opponent, but the upgrade backfired by making Carltron more malevolent. He sabotaged the transporter to Evermore and designed the hostile beasts roaming the game. With Ruffleberg's help, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his canine companion break into Carltron's room. The area is guarded by android clones of <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his dog, along with a giant mecha version of Carltron. At the last moment, Ruffleberg appears and deactivates Carltron, who promptly freezes in place.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{that sits}} atop the Burnside Fountain is now {{commonly}} referred to as Turtle Boy. In the tradition of the Manneken Pis in Brussels, Turtle Boy has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester. Much of the local popularity of the statue is due to bawdy insinuations about how <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> the turtle are portrayed. Anonymous members of the Worcester community sometimes dress the statue in festive clothes for holidays, local bands write crowd-pleasing songs about it, and the statue has even graced postcards of the city.|$|E

5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and raises her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens the boy with a knife. The next day, the three go fishing in the boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E
5|$|Although the Charter of 1215 was {{a failure}} as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new {{government}} of the young Henry III {{as a way of}} drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most famous}} knights in England. William knighted <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>and</b> Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.|$|E

5|$|Ewondo {{who learned}} were highly favoured {{in the early}} days of the colonial regime. Station {{commander}} Hans Dominik sent four such individuals to attend the mission school of the German Pallottine Fathers in Kribi, a settlement on the coast. There, Atangana learned German language, history, and geography; mathematics; and Roman Catholicism. Father Heinrich Vieter especially liked <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>and</b> Atangana became the first Ewondo baptised a Roman Catholic; he took the Christian name Karl. Atangana's schooling had just ended when members of the Bulu ethnic group, one closely related to the Ewondo, invaded Kribi and sacked the school and church in 1899. Atangana waited out the revolt in Douala with the Fathers until the colonial militia defeated the rebels the following year.|$|E
5|$|Fields' {{career as}} a film editor {{commenced}} in 1960, when the director Irving Lerner recruited her to be {{the editor of the}} film Studs Lonigan; Fields and Lerner had both worked on The Savage Eye. In 1963 she edited An Affair of the Skin, which was directed by Ben Maddow (another Savage Eye contact). Over the next five years, Fields edited several other independent films; the best known is The Legend of <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>and</b> the Eagle (1967), which was shown on the television program Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. She also made documentaries funded by the United States government through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the United States Information Agency (USIA), and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E

5|$|From 1210 on, Michael I Komnenos Doukas {{was engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of expansion, chiefly {{at the expense of}} the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica to his east; after initial reverses, much of Thessaly was conquered. By 1214, Dyrrhachium and Corfu had been recovered from the Latins as well. The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the Latin Empire, but historian Philip Van Tricht argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire until 1217. Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215. As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore had no trouble in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his mother spent the duration of his reign exiled in the Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was staying}} safely at Corfe Castle in Dorset {{with his mother}} when King John died. On his deathbed, John {{appointed}} a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most}} famous knights in England. The loyalist leaders decided to crown Henry immediately to reinforce his claim to the throne. William knighted <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>and</b> Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October. In the absence of the archbishops of Canterbury or York, he was anointed by the bishops of Worcester and Exeter, and crowned by Peter des Roches. The royal crown had been either lost or sold during the civil war, so instead the ceremony used a simple gold corolla belonging to Queen Isabella.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Provost {{declined}} to renew his contract. Producers decided {{to broaden the}} show's demographics to appeal to older viewers, and, to that end, dropped <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his dog theme for a plot featuring a Forest Service Ranger. Robert Bray, a former Marine and Gary Cooper look-alike was cast as Corey Stuart. During Bray's first year, the show transitioned to color filming and spectacular scenic locations across America were exploited as settings for the show. Eventually, Bray's alcoholism forced him from the show, and Jack De Mave and Jed Allan were hired to replace him.|$|E

5|$|In each of {{the four}} realms, the boy {{encounters}} a citizen of Podunk involved in the original experiment gone awry 30 years ago. Professor Sidney Ruffleberg and his three companions were transported to Evermore, but are unable to leave. The boy quickly learns that the regions are manifestations of those citizens' personal utopias. Each of the three companions act as the ruler of his or her world: Elizabeth, the Professor's niece, is the tribal chief of Prehistoria; Horace Highwater, curator of the Podunk Museum, oversees Antiqua; Camellia Bluegarden, a portly librarian, is the Queen of Gothica; and Professor Ruffleberg monitors everything from Omnitopia, with his android butler, Carltron, alongside him. Within Prehistoria, Antiqua, and Gothica, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his canine companion aid Elizabeth, Horace, and Camellia in thwarting attempts by robotic clones of the Podunk citizens from ruling their respective areas.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} {{in a much more}} sympathetic and honorable light. In {{one of the most famous}} renditions of the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 film The Hero, {{produced}} by Fernando Vendrell {{and directed by}} Zézé Gamboa, depicts the life of average Angolans {{in the aftermath of}} the civil war.

The Hero won the 2005 Sundance World Dramatic Cinema Jury Grand Prize. A joint Angolan, Portuguese, and French production, The Hero was filmed entirely in Angola.|$|E

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate {{a high school student}} who is the prime suspect in the bizarre murder of a police officer.

5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore follows {{a boy and}} his pet dog as they are {{inadvertently}} transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The player guides both <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> his shapeshifting dog through Evermore, {{a world that is}} composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana series.|$|E
5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, early in the evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E
