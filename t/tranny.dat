She told MTV [...] "I wrote [...] about this guy that I've been stalking since I was, like, 15, but he's a total loser, so I don't want to glorify him in any way, but I'm really excited for the song." [...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came to see my show at this huge gay bar in New York and it was totally off the chain. He gets up on stage, takes all his clothes off except his underwear and starts making out with a <b>tranny.</b> I was like, 'Wait a minute, have I been barking up the wrong genre of tree?'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a lengthy}} article about Vazaleen in Toronto Life, critic R. M. Vaughan wrote, [...] "In its lewd, spontaneous, hysterical and glamorous way, Vazaleen defined a new Toronto aesthetic, a playful and {{endlessly}} inventive mode of presentation that encompassed everything from lesbian prog- rock to <b>tranny</b> camp to vintage punk revival to good old-fashioned loud-mouthed drag." [...] In {{an editorial in}} C magazine, Amish Morrell wrote, [...] "At [...] {{it was not only}} okay to be gay, but it was okay to be other than gay. One could be just about anything. The effect was that it completely destabilized all preconceptions of gender and sexual identity, in a hyperlibidinous environment where everyone became a performer." [...] Benjamin Boles of Now wrote, [...] "These days it’s normal in Toronto for hip gay scenes to flourish outside of the queer ghetto and to attract a wide spectrum of genders and orientations, but that didn’t really happen until Vazaleen took off and became a veritable community for everyone who didn’t fit into the mainstream homo world. For too long, it was too rare to see dykes, fags, trans people, and breeders hanging out together, and Munro changed that." [...] Vazaleen became a launching pad for such musical acts as Peaches and Lesbians on Ecstasy. Other bands performing at Vazaleen early in their careers were The Hidden Cameras, Crystal Castles, and The Gossip. At the height of the event's popularity, Munro appeared on the cover of Now magazine (made up to look similar to David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album cover), musical guests included Carole Pope, Tracy + the Plastics, Vaginal Davis, Glen Meadmore and Nina Hagen, and Vazaleen appeared on [...] "best-of" [...] nightclub lists internationally.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>tranny</b> chaser was {{originally}} (and still predominantly) {{used to describe}} men sexually interested in visibly trans women, but it is now used by some trans men as well.
