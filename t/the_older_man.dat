5|$|The Bus Uncle is a Cantonese YouTube {{viral video}} clip of a quarrel between two men aboard a bus in Hong Kong on 27 April 2006. While <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> who came to be nicknamed the Bus Uncle, scolded the man seated behind him, a nearby {{passenger}} used a camera phone to record the entire incident. The resulting six-minute video was uploaded to the Hong Kong Golden Forum, YouTube, and Google Videos. The clip became YouTube's most viewed video in May 2006, attracting viewers with its rhetorical outbursts and copious use of profanity by <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> receiving 1.7million hits in the first 3 weeks of that month.|$|E

Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E

5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> {{may be a}} reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E
5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
50|$|A {{man named}} James narrates the story, {{and is a}} {{caretaker}} for an <b>old</b> sick <b>man.</b> He {{takes care of the}} man eight hours a day and during that time, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is completely dependent on him for all basic needs. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is extremely wealthy and used to work as a dance teacher. He was so passionate about dance that he regularly has his old students come and perform for him. Throughout the story the narrator speculates <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>mans</b> homosexuality while keeping his own sexuality unconfirmed. When James is not working for <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> he spends a lot time at a nearby bar watching clips from old films. Although he spends much time taking care of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> his motives are questionable as he entertains selfish thoughts of stealing from <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> James risks <b>the</b> health of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> by manipulating his medications and pocketing a portion of the allotted amounts.

5|$|Cleared of any {{responsibility}} for McKay's death, Byrne collected his £200 prize money, {{and as the}} winner {{earned the right to}} fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829, but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight, much to the disapproval of his backers and friends. Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of £250 plus an additional £250 if he lost; the event became known in some quarters as the Leicester Hoax. Ward did not fight again for two years, but he and Byrne finally met on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. Each fighter was paid £200. Although Ward was <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> he prevailed in the contest after one hour and seventeen minutes, when Byrne's seconds, Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds, withdrew their man in the 33rd round.|$|E
5|$|From Ozone Park, {{he moved}} to Manhattan, where a counter-cultural {{community}} had built up around the Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side that contained an array of gay people, hippies, occultists and others adopting bohemian lifestyles. Without money, he resorted to working as a rent boy, and made use of both marijuana and LSD. Although he briefly returned to Catholicism, in 1971 he read a copy of Witchcraft Today (1954), a book authored by Englishman Gerald Gardner, the founder of Gardnerian Wicca, and it reignited his interest in Pagan religion. In the autumn, he tracked down Leo Martello (1931–2000), a prominent gay rights activist and Pagan Witch who practiced his own Italian-focused form of the Craft known as the Strega tradition. Although he felt that Buczynski was too inexperienced in magic to begin practicing Strega Craft, Martello befriended and shared his contacts with the young man, and took him {{with him on a}} visit to Herman Slater (1935–1992), a fellow New Yorker who was of Jewish heritage. Like Buczynski and Martello, Slater was gay, and a romantic relationship soon developed between Buczynski – who was attracted to bears – and <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man.</b> Buczynski moved in with Slater to an apartment in the Brooklyn Heights in June 1972.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that in late-Classical and Hellenistic Sparta boys were expected to take an older male mentor, usually an unmarried young man.

It is notable, however, that the only contemporary source with direct experience of the agoge, Xenophon, explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship.|$|E
