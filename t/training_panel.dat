40|$|Consumers {{cultural}} background {{is known to}} influence their food choice. To better understand the sensory perception across cultures, {{it is helpful to}} work with both a descriptive panel and consumers. This study examined how tea products of differing fermentation levels were described and liked by different cultures. Seven tea samples were evaluated by Korean and French <b>trained</b> <b>panels</b> and consumers. The <b>trained</b> <b>panels</b> evaluated the samples on appearance, flavor, and mouthfeel. The consumers rated the samples on acceptability and familiarity. The result indicated that both descriptive panels experienced varying degrees of taste and odor cross-modal interaction. On the unfamiliar samples, French panelists perceived high sweetness, and low bitterness and astringency in the presence of preferred aromas, suggesting that liking influences taste even for <b>trained</b> <b>panels.</b> Consumers generally liked familiar products but even an unfamiliar sample was liked when coupled with more preferred sensory characteristics and less disliked sensory properties. Present findings indicate that even <b>trained</b> <b>panels</b> are influenced by familiarity and liking. In order to better understand the cultural differences in liking, a descriptive sensory test within a culture is recommended especially when the samples are unfamiliar to that culture.

40|$|International audienceOur {{experiment}} involved seven {{panels and}} six chocolates – five dark chocolates and one milk chocolate. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare the sensory profiles of the chocolates. A natural question to ask is "Did the panelists detect any differences among the five dark chocolates or did they systematically contrast them with the milk chocolate?" The scatter plot of the chocolates obtained by principal component analysis was useless to answer that question, because of the proximity of the points. To overcome that, we used confidence ellipses calculated using bootstrap. The originality of the study lies in the fact that we applied those ellipses to hierarchical multiple factor analysis (HMFA) : among the seven panels, six were composed of trained professionals and the last one was composed of untrained students, and through that method, we managed to compare the two types of panels and balance the role of each <b>trained</b> <b>panel.</b> HMFA provides in a single scatter plot a representation of the six chocolates for each <b>panel,</b> the <b>trained</b> <b>panels</b> and all the panels. Confidence ellipses around each chocolate show that the combined panels – the six <b>trained</b> <b>panels</b> and also the untrained panel – differentiate the five dark chocolates.

40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{establish}} artificial neural networks (ANN) as an alternate to regression methods (multiple linear, principal components and partial least squares regression) to predict consumer liking from <b>trained</b> sensory <b>panel</b> data. The study has two parts viz., I) Flavour study - evaluation of ANNs to predict consumer flavour preferences from <b>trained</b> sensory <b>panel</b> data and 2) Fragrance study &# 150; evaluation of different ANN architectures to predict consumer fragrance liking from <b>trained</b> sensory <b>panel</b> data. In this study, a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture with input, hidden and output layer(s) was designed. The back-propagation algorithm was utilised in training of neural networks. The network learning parameters such as learning rate and momentum rate were optimised by the grid experiments for a fixed number of learning cycles. In flavour study, ANNs were trained using the <b>trained</b> sensory <b>panel</b> raw data as well as transformed data. The networks <b>trained</b> with sensory <b>panel</b> raw data achieved 98 % correct learning, whereas the testing was {{within the range of}} 28 - 35 %. A suitable transformation methods were applied to reduce the variations in <b>trained</b> sensory <b>panel</b> raw data. The networks trained with transformed sensory panel data achieved between 80 - 90 % correct learning and 80 - 95 % correct testing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarise}} our previous {{results on the}} effectiveness of different kinds of labour market training programmes as well as employment programmes in East Germany after unification. All the studies use the microeconometric evaluation approach and are based on different types of matching estimators. We find some positive earnings effect for on-the-job training and also some positive employment effects for employment programmes. No such effects appear for public sector sponsored (off-the-job) training programmes. Generally, the scope of such analysis is very much hampered by the insufficient quality and quantity of the data available for East Germany. Although in particular the results for public sector sponsored training programmes raise serious doubts about the effectiveness of these programmes, any definite policy conclusion from this and other studies about active labour market policy in East Germany would probably be premature.

Our results show that workers on short-term employment contracts, who are working part-time, or who {{are not covered by}} a union collective agreement, are significantly less likely to be involved in any work-related training to improve or increase their skills.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{study of}} {{carbonation}} perception is limited, even though carbonated beverages are very popular. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to determine the sensory properties of carbonation itself and its interaction with other sensory modalities. First, the power functions of carbonation in carbonated spring water were developed by a <b>trained</b> <b>panel</b> using two assessing conditions, swallowing and expectoration. Five carbonation levels, 1. 2 2. 0. 2. 5, 3. 0, and 3. 9 volumes CO 2, were employed. The size of the exponents, 2. 79 (swallowing) and 2. 65 (expectoration), suggested a sharp increase of perceived carbonation magnitude with increasing concentration. There {{was no significant difference}} between exponents resulting from the two assessing conditions. Second, the effects of temperature on carbonation perception in carbonated spring water were determined by use of both a <b>trained</b> <b>panel</b> and a naive panel. Two carbonation levels, 2. 4 and 3. 0 volumes, and four temperature levels, 3 °, 10 °, 16 ° and 22 °C, were employed. Carbonation intensity was perceived to be higher at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. This effect held true for both <b>trained</b> and naive <b>panels.</b> The temperature effect on carbonation perception, however, was carbonation level dependent. Differences were more evident at the higher carbonation level. Thirdly, the mutual effects of carbonation and tastants (sweetener and acidulant) were determined by a <b>trained</b> <b>panel.</b> How CO 2 affects sweetness and how sweetener level affects carbonation perception were measured in both sucrose and aspartame sweetened systems.

40|$|Using {{information}} on job histories and on two training questions contained in Statistics Canada's Follow-Up to the School Leavers Survey, this paper seeks to answer three basic questions: 1) {{what are the}} characteristics of the trainees?; 2) Does the receipt of employer-supported training cause an increase in the wage paid to those young workers?; and 3) Does it improve the degree of job attachment?; I find that more educated young people are somewhat more likely to be trained than high school dropouts although there is strong evidence of selectivity as employers clearly seem to support training for those that have the most “favorable” characteristics. Also, controlling for unobserved individual characteristics, I find that training has a sizeable wage impact for men while the effect is much more modest for women. Finally, results using Chamberlain (1985) fixed-effects hazard model show that the conditional probability of the employment relationship being terminated decreases substantially for trainees, which is consistent with the notion that the skills learned by trainees may have a sizeable firm-specific component.
