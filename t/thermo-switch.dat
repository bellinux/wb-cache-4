40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{presence}} of wax and radiation-induced crosslinking on the morphology, thermal and mechanical properties, as well as electrical conductivity and <b>thermo-switch</b> properties of LDPE containing different amounts of carbon black (CB) or carbon black plus zinc metal as filler. Although the filler was generally well dispersed in the polymer or polymer/wax blend, there were clear indications of the formation of conductive pathways. Different combinations of polymer, wax, CB and zinc filler and radiation induced crosslinking gave rise to different extents of crystallinity and/or chain immobilization, which had an influence on the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties, and on the electrical conductivity and <b>thermo-switch</b> behaviour. Most importantly, the presence of wax, and CB and CB/Zn fillers, gave rise to increased electrical conductivity. The thermal expansion in the composites did not seem to {{play a significant role in}} obtaining larger values of the positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTC). We found that the presence of a small amount of paraffin wax significantly increased the PTC coefficients of the LDPE based conductive composites, and that Î³-radiation induced crosslinking provided the thermomechanical stability of the amorphous regions in LDPE needed to obtain a high PTC intensity, which would provide a cheap material with good <b>thermo-switch</b> functionality, which is something not observed before...|$|E
40|$|Background RNA {{thermometers}} are mRNA strands with {{a temperature}} dependent secondary structure: de-pending on the spatial conformation, the mRNA strand can get translated (on-state) {{or can be}} inaccessible for ribosomes binding (off-state). These {{have been found in}} a number of micro-organisms (mainly pathogens), where they are used to adaptively regulate the gene expression, in response to changes in the environmental tempera-ture. Besides naturally occurring RNA thermometers, synthetic RNA thermometers have been recently designed by modifying their natural counterparts [19]. The newly designed RNA thermometers are simpler, and exhibit a sharper switching between off- and on-states. However, the proposed trial-and-error design procedure has not been algorithmically formalized, and the switching temperature is rigidly determined by the natural RNA thermometer used as template for the design. Results We developed a general algorithmic procedure (consensus distribution) for the design of RNA thermo-switches with a tunable switching temperature that can be decided in advance by the designer. A software tool with a user friendly GUI has been written to automate the design of RNA thermo-switches with a desired threshold temperature. Starting from a natural template, a new RNA thermometer has been designed by our method for a new desired threshold temperature of 32 C.

A software tool with a user friendly GUI has been written to automate the design of RNA thermo-switches with a desired threshold temperature. Starting from a natural template, a new RNA thermometer has been designed by our method for a new desired threshold temperature of 32 C. The designed RNA <b>thermo-switch</b> has been experimentally validated by using it to control the expression of lucifarase. A 9. 2 fold increase of luminescence has been observed between 30 C and 37 C, whereas between 20 C and 30 C the luminescence increase is less than 3 -fold. This work represents a first step towards the design of flexible and tunable RNA thermometers {{that can be used for}} a precise control of gene expression without the need of external chemicals and possibly for temperature measurements at a nano-scale resolution.
