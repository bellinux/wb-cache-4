5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} an A-, {{explaining}} {{he thought it}} must have been [...] "satisfying" [...] for those viewers tired of the [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] storylines. Murray also enjoyed two twists: that Olivia had to shut off the lights for real, and that Walter discovers he wrote the ZFT manual at the end. Jane Boursaw of AOL TV (previously TV Squad) opined that it was a [...] "really great episode that's probably worth another viewing to pick up more clues," [...] while the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson thought it [...] "managed to have a couple good twists to it." [...] Annalee Newitz of io9 praised [...] "Ability", remarking that [...] "overall, this was a terrific episode, and a great way to go into a show hiatus. We got a lot of payoff when we discovered why Olivia was being stalked by the ZFT weirdos, and we learned more about the Pattern <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> in a really long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E
500|$|The London Magazine was {{similarly}} effusive about the painting, admiring Etty's ability to fuse his own imagination with themes {{derived from the}} Elgin Marbles and from the Venetian Old Masters, and commenting that [...] "it is always gratifying to those who feel for the honour and independence of painting when, as in the present instance, an artist successfully relies on nature and the resources of his own mind for his subject, and on the appreciation of collegial minds for his mode of treating it." [...] The Times, a newspaper which had previously condemned Etty as [...] "offensive and indecent", felt that [...] "though defective in some respects" [...] The Combat was [...] "a masterly effort" [...] that successfully fused [...] "the florid beauties of the Venetian school" [...] with the [...] "sober dignity {{and power of the}} Roman school" [...] and that compared with his previous paintings, which were [...] "too uniformly feeble in character and meretricious in effect to entitle them to any very decided praise", the painting proved Etty [...] "capable of maintaining a much higher station in art <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been led to expect." ...|$|E

In 2004 IGN's editors selected it as the ninth best [...] "Hidden Gems"—fun video games with poor sales in America. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine included the game on its 2005 list of the [...] "Eleven Essential Fighting Games". In 2007 UGO Networks placed it ninth in their [...] "Top 11 Fighting Games", with its staff qualifying it as the best game of the series. IGN cited X2 had all of the qualities previous games, but [...] "in bigger quantities <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> ever seen", including it in the 28th place of its 2010 [...] "Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games" [...] list.

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Nick Offerman improvised the line [...] "Put it in an e-mail?", which he said when Leslie told him she had a very long story to tell him. Schur thought the line was [...] "my {{favorite}} thing in the show", and they made him say in it every subsequent take during filming. Aziz Ansari also improvised a majority of the scene in which he helped Leslie prepare for her ethics board review. Dean Holland, Parks and Recreations editor, said it was his favorite scene from the entire first season. Amy Poehler improvised the line at the courtyard gathering, after she accidentally spilled several beer bottles, [...] "I feel like I'm already in the boys' club. Look at those bitches cleanin' up after me." [...] Schur said the line helped develop Leslie's character in future episodes because [...] "we realized that Leslie can be a little bit cooler <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> originally thought". The scene with Ron describing his ideal government was written for a different episode, but was moved to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] when the producers decided it fit better there. Schur said it was his favorite moment in the episode. [...] "Boys' Club" [...] ends with Leslie and Mark toasting a beer to each other because Schur said, [...] "It's a running joke in the writer's room that every episode should end with clinking beers." ...|$|E

Certainly financing the project has been slower <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> hoped and expected." [...] It was also reported that the delay in financing had impacted hiring, causing the company to reduce its staff in Superior. The WEDC and Kestrel agreed upon new terms that would defer the payments until November 2014.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 July, the Russian Council of Ministers met {{to decide}} their {{response}} to the crisis. The Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Krivoshein, who was especially trusted by Nicholas, noted that:"...our rearmament programme had not been completed and it seemed doubtful whether our Army and Fleet would {{ever be able to}} compete with those of Germany and Austria-Hungary as regards modern technical efficiency... No one in Russia desired a war. The disastrous consequences of the Russo-Japanese War had shown the grave danger which Russia would run in case of hostilities. Consequently our policy should aim at reducing the possibility of a European war, but if we remained passive we would attain our objectives... In his view stronger language <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> used hitherto was desirable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to the sculpture's {{potential}} for controversy, {{the point that}} each country's piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government. According to Lidové noviny, Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked: [...] "The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression {{and that is how}} Entropa must be viewed. But, had I known the circumstances were different <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> thought {{for a year and a}} half, I would not have authorized it." [...] Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from Černý's work early on, saying,It is a piece of artnothing else... If Europe is not strong enough to look at this, it would be a tragedy. It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists. It is not Europe through the eyes of the Czech presidency.|$|E
