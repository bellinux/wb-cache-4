5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in two parts, four {{movements to}} be performed before <b>the</b> <b>sermon,</b> three after <b>the</b> <b>sermon.</b> Both parts begin with a sinfonia. Bach scored it for an alto soloist and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes (Ob), taille (Ot), obbligato solo organ (Org), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E

5|$|Swift {{relies on}} Gospel of Matthew in this sermon (Swift quotes from <b>the</b> <b>Sermon</b> on the Mount, Matthew 7:12) {{instead of the}} other Gospels; this is {{standard}} practice for Swift, because the Gospel features a simple, non-controversial history that complements Swift's religious views.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. <b>The</b> <b>sermon</b> was {{the focal point of the}} service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of <b>the</b> <b>sermon</b> in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{possibly}} led {{the audition}} {{performance of the}} work in Leipzig in the Thomaskirche on 7 February 1723, probably after <b>the</b> <b>sermon.</b> He performed the cantata again for the same occasion on 20 February 1724, this time reinforcing the voices by a brass choir in the final movement.|$|E
5|$|Each sermon {{begins with}} a scriptural passage that {{reinforces}} the ideas that {{will be discussed in}} <b>the</b> <b>sermon</b> and each was preceded with the same opening prayer (which Swift also delivered). The sermons are plainly written and apply a common-sense approach to contemporary moral issues in Dublin. Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources such}} as the Manchester Mercury name Byrom as the sponsor of the building, they do not identify his architect. The church was described by the English author and historian Clare Hartwell as being the first significant building in Manchester to be constructed in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. It had galleries supported by slender cast-iron columns. The foundation stone was laid by Edward Byrom on 28 April 1768 and Keene performed the consecration on 7 July 1769, when <b>the</b> <b>sermon</b> was given by John Byrom's friend, John Clayton. Construction of the tower, which contained a peal of eight bells manufactured by Lester and Pack, was completed in May 1770.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata at a decisive {{turning point in}} his career. Moving from posts {{in the service of}} churches and courts to the town of Leipzig on the first Sunday after Trinity, 30 May 1723, he began the project of composing a new cantata for every occasion of the liturgical year. He began his first annual cycle of cantatas ambitiously with , in an unusual layout of 14 movements in two symmetrical parts, to be performed before and after <b>the</b> <b>sermon.</b> , performed a week later, has the same structure.|$|E
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 12 August 1714. When he performed {{it again in}} Leipzig on the eleventh Sunday after Trinity in 1723 (8 August) {{it was the first}} solo cantata and the most operatic work which he had presented to the congregation up to that point. He made revisions for that performance, such as transposing it from C minor to D minor and changing the obbligato viola to violoncello piccolo. In the same service, he also performed a new work, : one before and one after <b>the</b> <b>sermon.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>sermon</b> {{for his own}} political gain; the see of Derry had just opened and Evans wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an inspection of the clergy of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod to defend himself, his sermons, and his politics, and instead of resolving the issue, only caused more dispute between the two.|$|E

5|$|It was {{difficult}} for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after them properly. Thus, the Gurkar system came into existence. Gurkars were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted with the social and religious supervision of the community. After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers. Every farmer practised carpentry, but it was quite primitive and unskilled, and other crafts and industries were non-existent. The mass was celebrated in Latin; but <b>the</b> <b>sermon,</b> the catechism, and the explication of the mysteries were delivered to the congregation in Konkani.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation.

After Knox gave an explanation of <b>the</b> <b>sermon,</b> Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that he disliked. Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form {{the core of the}} early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes <b>the</b> <b>Sermon</b> on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water {{and a number of other}} miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E
