40|$|The {{envelope}} proteins <b>of</b> 5 <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Desulfotomaculum and 12 <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Desulfovibrio {{were studied}} by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. <b>The</b> Desulfovibrio <b>strains</b> exhibited a typical gram-negative cell envelope, whereas the cell envelope <b>of</b> Desulfotomaculum <b>strains</b> {{appeared to be}} gram-positive. A close relationship between <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Desulfotomaculum nigrificans was observed. A comparison between different species of Desulfotomaculum revealed some degree of similarity between Desulfotomaculum nigrificans and Desulfotomaculum ruminis, whereas Desulfotomaculum orientis seemed unique. <b>The</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Desulfovibrio salexigens were quite different from <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other species of Desulfovibrio. In two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, a species-specific antigen was observed. <b>The</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Desulfovibrio africanus, and Desulfovibrio gigas and one <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> Desulfovibrio desulfuricans exhibited a similar outer membrane protein profile and also showed very similar antigenic reactions...|$|R

5|$|Between 1929 and 1935, under <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> World Depression, {{political}} thinking worldwide {{received a}} jolt from {{the spread of}} international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came {{under the influence of}} the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E

These resupply operations had required considerable effort and bravery to effect, {{and a number of}} Korean porters were killed and wounded at Maryang San.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E

French felt he was being punished for requesting to have Gus Mancuso as his catcher. In addition, Hartnett was forced to catch more games {{due to the lack}} of hitting from the other Cubs catchers. On August 28, 1939, he broke Ray Schalk's Major League record of 1,727 career games as a catcher. His record for longevity was surpassed by Al López during the 1945 season.|$|E

5|$|The Steam {{client was}} first made {{available}} for public beta testing in January 2003 during the beta period for Counter-Strike 1.6, {{for which it was}} mandatory to install and use. At the time, Steam's primary function was streamlining the patch process common in online computer games. Steam was an optional component for all other games. 80,000–300,000 gamers tested the system when it was in its beta period. The system and website choked under <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> thousands of users simultaneously attempting to play the latest version of Counter-Strike.

Strains of H. pylori that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is under way. As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.|$|E

The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his Fourth (1914–16) and Fifth symphonies (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication {{of many of his}} major works, including Aladdin and Pan and Syrinx.|$|E

5|$|Two {{thirds of}} people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} have experienced an infection {{before the onset of}} the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, the exact nature of the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by Campylobacter jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only very few people with Campylobacter or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively). <b>The</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> Campylobacter involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{existence}} of possible cross-protection between Trypanosoma congolense <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> low and extreme virulence circulating in the same trypanosomiasis focus. Groups of six mice were infected using one <b>of</b> three <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> low virulence and challenged with one <b>of</b> three <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> extreme virulence. A group of six mice was used as control for each <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> low and extreme virulence. The results showed that mice infected with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> extreme virulence developed high parasitaemia and a significant drop of the PCV compared to mice infected with a <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> low virulence and challenged with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> extreme virulence. With an exception <b>of</b> one <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> extreme virulence (<b>strain</b> F), <b>the</b> survival time of mice infected with <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> extreme virulence was shorter compared to mice infected with <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> low virulence and subsequently challenged with a <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> extreme virulence. These results suggest that in an area where trypanosomes of various virulence profiles circulate, livestock infected with T. congolense <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> low virulence can be protected against the adverse effects of extremely virulent T. congolense strains...|$|R

5|$|At this point, the Australian {{commander}} {{issued a}} new operation order, reassigning {{the task of}} capturing the Christmas Hills area to the 24th Infantry Brigade and pulling the 20th Infantry Brigade back to Nongora to rest up for {{the next phase of}} the campaign, which would see them advance up the coast. <b>The</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the advance along the coastal route, which had been the 24th Infantry Brigade's main effort, however, had taken its toll. As a result, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion was called forward again as the 2/28th was plagued by sickness and the 2/43rd was physically worn out. On the night of 4/5 December, the Japanese withdrew from their forward positions, leaving behind a large quantity of equipment and their dead. The following morning, a composite force of Australians from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions then took up the advance towards the Christmas Hills, ranging west, and undertaking a series of flanking moves in order to break into the Japanese main defensive position, where the Japanese were well-entrenched. A firefight ensued in which six Japanese and seven Australians were killed, before the Australian attack was turned back.|$|E
5|$|Being {{frozen in}} an iceberg {{for a hundred}} years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would be powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E
