But that's just a name, you know, like 'shoe'." [...] Paul McCartney immediately chimed in, [...] "The Shoes, you see? We could have been called the Shoes for all you know." [...] But if the band's name was intended to be an intentional evocation of that moment, there would certainly have been a [...] "The," [...] which there isn't.
