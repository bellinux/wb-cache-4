5|$|The {{only known}} {{dihalide}} of silver is the difluoride, AgF2, {{which can be}} obtained from the elements under heat. A strong yet <b>thermally</b> stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent, silver(II) fluoride is often used to synthesize hydrofluorocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of <b>thermally</b> stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{protective}} gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its inertness, <b>thermally</b> and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} {{technologies such}} as the Paraho Direct are <b>thermally</b> efficient, since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the retort. These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two well-established shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, {{and a number of}} Chinese companies operate Fushun process facilities.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen forms nine {{molecular}} oxides, some {{of which}} were the first gases to be identified: N2O (nitrous oxide), NO (nitric oxide), N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), N2O4 (dinitrogen tetroxide), N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), NO3 (nitrogen trioxide), N4O (nitrosylazide), and N(NO2)3 (trinitramide).)3 |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1145–8 |doi=10.1002/anie.201007047}} All are <b>thermally</b> unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole (N4O), an aromatic ring.|$|E
5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} <b>thermally</b> unstable, in concordance {{with the}} trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below. Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a <b>thermally</b> allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product.|$|E
5|$|The product, chloryl fluoride, {{is one of}} {{the five}} known {{chlorine}} oxide fluorides. These range from the <b>thermally</b> unstable FClO to the chemically unreactive perchloryl fluoride (FClO3), the other three being FClO2, F3ClO, and F3ClO2. All five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides, both structurally and chemically, and may act as Lewis acids or bases by gaining or losing fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of moscovium has yet to have been established. In 2011, experiments were conducted to create nihonium, flerovium, and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium-48 projectiles and targets of americium-243 and plutonium-244. However, the targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions. This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively moscovium and livermorium. The produced nuclides bismuth-213 and polonium-212m were transported as the hydrides 213BiH3 and 212mPoH2 at 850°C through a quartz wool filter unit held with tantalum, showing that these hydrides were surprisingly <b>thermally</b> stable, although their heavier congeners McH3 and LvH2 {{would be expected to}} be less <b>thermally</b> stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p-block. Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH3, McH3, PoH2, and LvH2 are needed before chemical investigations take place. However, moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future. Though no known isotopes of livermorium are sufficiently long-lived, 288Mc, 289Mc, and 290Mc may be chemically investigated with current methods.|$|E
5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess <b>thermally</b> driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{construction}} {{began on}} the second phase, the B Station. The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was nearly identical to the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most <b>thermally</b> efficient power station in the world when it opened.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They <b>thermally</b> decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it <b>thermally</b> decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E
5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant <b>thermally</b> {{insulating}} dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{and gold}} have rather low {{chemical}} affinities for oxygen, lower than copper, {{and it is}} therefore expected that silver oxides are <b>thermally</b> quite unstable. Soluble silver(I) salts precipitate dark-brown silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, upon the addition of alkali. (The hydroxide AgOH exists only in solution; otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to the oxide.) Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160°C. This and other silver(I) compounds may be oxidized by the strong oxidizing agent peroxodisulfate to black AgO, a mixed silver(I,III) oxide of formula AgIAgIIIO2. Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag2O3 and Ag3O4, are also known, as is Ag3O which behaves as a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at solid material surfaces. The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a <b>thermally</b> promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest-neighbor jumps. Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect.|$|E
5|$|Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and {{nitrides}} are refractory materials, as {{are those}} of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels. All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are <b>thermally</b> unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.|$|E

Moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future, a property livermorium would then share with its lighter congener polonium. Though no known isotopes of livermorium have long enough half-lives, 288Mc, 289Mc, and 290Mc may be chemically investigated with current methods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermally</b> {{conductive}} tape {{is one of}} the most cost-effective heat sink attachment materials. It is suitable for low-mass heat sinks and for components with low power dissipation.

25|$|The silane {{produced}} by this route can be <b>thermally</b> decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen {{in a single}} pass.|$|E
25|$|Han blue is more {{chemically}} and <b>thermally</b> stable. It {{does not}} break down in dilute acids, and becomes more bluish when ground.|$|E
25|$|Black hole {{evaporation}} {{produces a}} more consistent view of black hole thermodynamics by showing how black holes interact <b>thermally</b> {{with the rest}} of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{thermistor}} is a silistor, a <b>thermally</b> sensitive silicon resistor. Silistors employ silicon as the semiconductive component material. Unlike ceramic PTC thermistors, silistors have {{an almost}} linear resistance-temperature characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Solving the {{differential}} equation {{leads to the}} relation shown below, where T0* is the stagnation temperature at the throat location of the duct which is required for <b>thermally</b> choking the flow.|$|E
25|$|Most metal nitrates <b>thermally</b> {{decompose}} to the respective oxides, but silver oxide decomposes {{at a lower}} temperature than silver nitrate, so the decomposition of silver nitrate yields elemental silver instead.|$|E
25|$|Borazine is a {{colourless}} liquid with an aromatic smell. In water it hydrolyzes to boric acid, ammonia, and hydrogen. Borazine, {{with a standard}} enthalpy change of formation ΔHf of −531kJ/mol, is <b>thermally</b> very stable.|$|E
25|$|Thus, cis-azobenzene may <b>thermally</b> relax back, in dark, to the trans isomer. Such thermal {{relaxation}} is slow at room temperature, and {{competes with}} photogeneration of the cis-isomer if the compound {{is exposed to}} ultraviolet or visible light.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of adamantane in petroleum in 1933 {{launched a new}} field of chemistry dedicated to studying the synthesis and properties of polyhedral organic compounds. Adamantane derivatives have found practical application as drugs, polymeric materials, and <b>thermally</b> stable lubricants.|$|E
25|$|Research {{based on}} actual {{performance}} {{measurements of the}} passive stacks found that they enhanced the cooling ventilation of the space during warm and still days and may also {{have the potential to}} assist night-time cooling due to their <b>thermally</b> massive structure.|$|E
25|$|Han purple is {{chemically}} and <b>thermally</b> {{less stable}} than Han blue. It fades and decomposes in dilute acid. Han purple starts to decompose at temperatures more than 1050–1100°C and forms a green-black glass at around 1200°C. It becomes more purplish when ground.|$|E
25|$|Holes {{may be made}} conductive, by {{electroplating}} or inserting metal eyelets (hollow), to electrically and <b>thermally</b> connect board layers. Some conductive {{holes are}} intended for the insertion of through-hole-component leads. Others, typically smaller and used to connect board layers, are called vias.|$|E
25|$|An {{even more}} rigid foam {{can be made}} with the use of {{specialty}} trimerization catalysts which create cyclic structures within the foam matrix, giving a harder, more <b>thermally</b> stable structure, designated as polyisocyanurate foams. Such properties are desired in rigid foam products used in the construction sector.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nyos is <b>thermally</b> stratified, with {{layers of}} warm, less dense water near the surface {{floating}} on the colder, denser water layers near the lake's bottom.
