5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas. Furthermore, there is no institution or program {{at the national level}} which offers <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to the 12,000 rural community organizations.

5|$|With the {{turnover}} of Point Cypress and Point Marone to South Vietnamese navy on 15 August 1970, Squadron One and its remaining division, Division 13, were decommissioned. Over 3,000 Coast Guardsmen had served with Squadron One in Vietnam since May 1965. Administrative and liaison functions {{that had been}} {{carried out by the}} Squadron One staff were turned over to the Office of the Senior Coast Guard Officer, Vietnam (SCGOV). Several officers of Squadron One were assigned temporary duties as advisors to former Squadron One cutters to further assist the new RVN commanding officers in their new duties. The Coast Guard continued to provide <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and training under the SCATTOR/VECTOR programs for the SVN after Squadron One was disestablished through the formation of four <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> Groups. Each group was composed of an officer and eight to eleven engineers reporting to SCGOV. The groups were located at Da Nang where there were six cutters assigned; Cam Ranh Bay, six cutters; Vung Tau, eight cutters; and An Thoi, six cutters. As tours of duty for each Coast Guardsman ended, U.S. Navy personnel gradually took over the training duties.|$|E

5|$|Coupled {{with his}} {{interest}} on cars, Lee's project of building SMI {{as a global}} automotive company started out with <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> from Nissan, a company {{which at the time}} of SMI's early stages was in dire financial straits. SMI's affiliation with Nissan could {{have been one of the}} reasons for Renault buying a major share of the company, as Renault had become a major shareholder of Nissan by then. One of the very early planners for SMI has stated that technical affiliations for SMI were initially considered with Volkswagen, BMW or Honda. From 1998, Renault Samsung Motors sold cars in Chile with the introduction of the SQ5 (the current SM5).|$|E
5|$|Eric Pringle, {{a veteran}} of 2D digital animation, was {{employed}} as animation director, providing Jones with much <b>technical</b> <b>assistance.</b> Pringle's colleagues from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, another Cartoon Network production, comprised a team of around fifteen full-time animators at the network's studio, all working on Apple computers. Greg Miller was hired as supervising director, Martin Cendreda as technical director, and John Pham with Jon Vermilyea as character designers. Miller is the creator of Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?, another series on the network. Vermilyea worked also as a character designer on the network's series Adventure Time, while Cendreda, Pham, and Jones all contributed to the anthology comic book Kramers Ergot. Michael Yank was employed as a writer for most episodes, with Mirari Films' CEO Eric Kaplan supervising the creation of scripts.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the heavy}} {{damage from the}} cyclone and other recent disasters, the World Bank enacted a plan for Andhra Pradesh in April 1997, {{consisting}} of repairing damaged infrastructure, an updated disaster plan, and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to the state government. Shelters and roads would be improved to higher standards. This plan ultimately cost about US$175million and was completed in July 2003, three years longer than expected but {{at a lower cost}} due to the Indian rupee losing some of its value. Power lines were improved to withstand winds of , while drains were enlarged and a coastal plant system was created to lessen flooding. An additional 82public shelters were constructed.

5|$|In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association {{was founded}} to promote {{conservation}} in the region. One of the association's initial concerns was the acidification of streams, which they originally attributed to tannic acid {{from the trees}} used by the beavers to construct their dams. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and Fish and Boat Commission, they dynamited 79 dams. Afterward, they discovered the water was acidic upstream of the dams too, and eventually realized that the problem was caused by acid rain, not the beavers. The association has operated several stations to reduce the acidity of Mosquito Creek and its tributaries, with <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> from the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a {{dredging}} project was proposed on Leggetts Creek {{to repair the}} damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD <b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> Program conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway.|$|E
