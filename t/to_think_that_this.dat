Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.|$|E

Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania {{was that it was}} too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{elements}} of game design, {{areas such as}} gameplay, mechanics, and similar features {{have been described as}} gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player. Gamers of both genders tend to crave realism and the more realistic the gender of the character, the easier it is for a player to identify with the character. A 2009 academic study published in New Media & Society, however, found that 85% of playable characters in video games are male. Erin Hamilton argues that part of the problem comes from the difficulty in [...] "juxtaposing femininity and feminism in a good video game." [...] When female characters do appear in video games, they are often regarded as presenting unhealthy messages concerning unrealistic body images and provocative sexual and violent behaviors for players of both genders. Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is how girls are supposed to look and act. Furthermore, over-sexualized depictions of scantily clad female video game characters such as Tomb Raiders Lara Croft are not appealing to some girls.|$|E

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, {{she said she was}} [...] "surprised by the intensity and the fury" [...] that came from fans and she did not think [...] "anyone on the show expected such social outcry." [...] To Debnam-Carey, [...] "any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and is a great thing to pursue and keep working towards." [...] She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "I know obviously that it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people," [...] stated Debnam-Carey. [...] "And I hate that people feel like that. That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted."

2500|$|Remark: Suppose G = ⟨X|R⟩ is a finitely {{presented}} {{group with}} solvable word problem and H is a finite subset G. Let H* = ⟨H⟩, be the group generated by H. Then the word problem in H* is solvable: given two words h, k in the generators H of H*, write them as words in X and compare them using {{the solution to}} the word problem in G. It is easy <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> demonstrates a uniform solution the word problem for the class K (say) of finitely generated groups that can be embedded in G. If this were the case the non-existence of a universal solvable word problem group would follow easily from Boone-Rogers. However, solution just exhibited for the word problem for groups in K is not uniform. To see this consider a group J = ⟨Y|T⟩ ∈ K, in order to use the above argument to solve the word problem in J, it is first necessary to exhibit a mapping [...] e: Y → G that extends to an embedding e*: [...] J → G. If there were a recursive function that mapped (finitely generated) presentations of groups in K to embeddings into G, then a uniform solution the word problem in K could indeed be constructed. But there is no reason, in general, to suppose that such a recursive function exists. However, it turns out that, using a more sophisticated argument, the word problem in J can be solved without using an embedding e: J → G. Instead an enumeration of homomorphisms is used, and since such enumeration can be constructed uniformly, it results in a uniform solution to the word problem in K.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his inaugural lecture, Lake published two important books on historical and exegetical matters concerning the New Testament during his time in Leiden: The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (1907) and The Earlier Epistles of St. Paul: Their Motive and Origin (1911). [...] As Metzger explains: [...] "These studies, particularly the latter, revealed Lake's ability to analyze and evaluate complex historical and literary data and to set forth scholarly reconstructions with clarity and a certain persuasiveness." [...] In Historical Evidence Lake sets forth his approach: [...] "The first task of the historical inquirer is to collect the pieces of evidence; the second is to discuss the trustworthiness and meaning of each separate piece; {{and the third is}} to reconstruct the events to which the evidence relates" [...] (p.6). [...] As for the reconstruction, he explains: [...] "In any such attempt it is desirable to remember that the reconstruction of an original tradition from forms of later dates and of divergent contents must be guided by exactly the same principle as is the reconstruction of an original text from a number of extant MSS. [...] In each case the fundamental problem is the retracing of the line of development followed by the various authorities, and the solution depends chiefly on the ability to detect errors of transmission and to explain their existence" [...] (p.167). [...] As for The Earlier Epistles, Neill writes: [...] "I think {{that those of us who}} read Lake when we were young will be inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is one of the best books on the New Testament that has ever been written in the English language. [...] This is the way it ought to be done. [...] Under Lake's skillful guidance, we feel ourselves one with those new and struggling groups of Christians, in all the perplexities of trying to discover what it means to be a Christian in a non-Christian world. [...] And there is the Apostle, so very much in working clothes and without a halo; we feel in our bones the passionate eagerness of Paul for better news from Corinth, the passionate relief when the good news arrives." [...] The book brought the conclusions of the German history of religions school to the attention of English-speaking world for the first time, and all later New Testament study has been influenced by this book.|$|E
