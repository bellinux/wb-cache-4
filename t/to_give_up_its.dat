5|$|As many {{newspapers}} {{belonging to}} the dwindling Communist Party, Arbeideren would cease to exist {{before the end of}} the 1920s. It was still published six times a week, but had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> printing press in 1929, switching to Samtrykk in Oslo. The last ever issue of Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad was published on 4 October 1929.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 the United States {{announced}} the Marshall Plan initiative {{to help rebuild}} postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially welcoming the idea of Poland's participation in the plan, the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow. Also, following the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens. Poland received compensation {{in the form of}} land and property left behind by the German population of the annexed western territories.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, the {{restaurant}} became the second {{restaurant in the}} Netherlands <b>to</b> voluntarily <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> Michelin star. Restaurant 't Misverstant did this in 1994.|$|R
2500|$|... 2010: The U.S. and Russia {{call for}} Iran <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> on <b>its</b> {{nuclear weapons program}} along with the United Kingdom, France and China on June 9.|$|R
50|$|In June 2006, {{the five}} {{permanent}} Security Council members plus Germany offered {{a package of}} economic incentives including transfer of technology in the civilian nuclear field, in exchange for Iran <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> permanently <b>its</b> disputed uranium enrichment programme.|$|R
25|$|The post-war {{tensions}} and arguments surrounding the Turkish Straits {{would come to}} be known as the Turkish Straits crisis. The fear of Soviet invasion and Joseph Stalin's unconcealed desire for Soviet military bases in the Turkish Straits eventually caused Turkey <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> principle of neutrality in foreign relations and join NATO in February 1952.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of {{improved}} diplomatic relations with the Bush Administration, India agreed to allow close international monitoring of its nuclear weapons development, although it has refused <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> current nuclear arsenal. In 2004, the US decided to grant Major non-NATO ally (MNNA) status to Pakistan. The US extended the MNNA strategic working relationship to India but the offer was turned down.|$|E
25|$|After 1843, fast on {{the heels}} of the Syrian debacle, and the treaty of Balta Liman, which forced the Egyptian {{government}} to tear down its import barriers, and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the silver nitrate he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.|$|E
50|$|According to Vlad Georgescu, {{the state}} {{appeared}} <b>to</b> have <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> social functions, as social spending declined throughout the 1980s. Between 1980 and 1985, cuts {{were made by}} the state in its housing expenditure (37%), healthcare (17%) and education, culture and science (53%), according to data provided to the Comecon.|$|R
50|$|In winter 1812, Napoleon had {{suffered}} a heavy defeat before Moscow upon which Prussia began <b>to</b> consider <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> enforced alliance with the French. It signed the Convention of Tauroggen with Russia on 30 December 1812, stipulating neutrality between them, and then on 27 March 1813 both powers declared war on France.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, an {{amendment}} to the Law on Audiovisual Services forced ZNM <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> one of <b>its</b> two seats in the board of the public service broadcaster to MAN.|$|R
25|$|The events {{led to the}} Quasi-War (1798–1800) between France and the United States, {{with actual}} naval {{encounters}} taking place between the two powers, with the encounter between USS Constellation and French ship L'Insurgente on 9 February 1799 off Nevis Island, and USS Constellation and La Vengeance in February 1800 off Guadeloupe. An agreement followed, in which the United States agreed to pay 20 million dollars in compensation, and France agreed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> claims to the 1778 Treaty.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get its merger with US Airways {{approved}} by the Department of Justice (DOJ), American Airlines was forced <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> 2 gates at Love Field. Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America all expressed interest, while the DOJ indicated that a low cost carrier should receive the gates. The former American Airlines gates were ultimately granted to Virgin America on October 13, 2014, thus denying the gates to Delta and Southwest.|$|E
25|$|In 1415, Frederick I {{became the}} elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440. Subsequent {{members of the}} Hohenzollern family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and finally as German emperors. When Berlin became the {{residence}} of the Hohenzollerns, it had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> Hanseatic League free city status. Its main economical activity changed from trade {{to the production of}} luxurious goods for the court.|$|E
50|$|There is {{at least}} one Volksfest in many of the larger towns in Germany every year, each lasting from one to three weeks. In some towns there are two or more per year. A Volkfest is local in nature, {{attended}} mostly by people original from the hosting town and surrounding areas, but it may also attract international tourists. Sindelfingen is the only town <b>to</b> have <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> Volksfest.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "retour" [...] {{also did}} not prevent France from losing its {{diplomatic}} war with the United Kingdom. France was forced <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> supporting <b>its</b> Egyptian ally. Thiers, losing his way in aggressive policies, was ridiculed and the king was compelled to dismiss him even before Belle Poule arrived. Thiers had managed to push through {{the return of the}} remains, but was unable to profit from that success.|$|R

25|$|The borders {{between the}} three {{countries}} got the shape they have had since {{in the middle of}} the seventeenth century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway ceded the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre & Särna, as well as the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia) to Sweden. The Treaty of Roskilde, signed in 1658, forced Denmark–Norway to cede the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. The 1660 Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to return Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark–Norway, and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> recent claims to the island Funen.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{civil servant}} C. S. Venkatachar {{wrote that the}} Kashmir issue might have been {{resolved}} in favour of India had Jawaharlal Nehru chosen C. P. instead of Gopalaswami Ayyangar to present India's case at the United Nations. The same view was also shared by Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar. While chairing the Indian Committee on National Integration, C. P. introduced the clause making it mandatory that newly elected member of Parliament and state assemblies should take an allegiance to the Indian Union. It is believed that the introduction of this clause compelled the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> goal of secession from the Indian Union.|$|E
25|$|After the 1982 Lebanon War {{the party}} cooperated with Israel Defense Forces, and its militia joined the South Lebanon Army (SLA). After the {{withdrawal}} of Israel from Lebanon in 2000, most of the leadership fled to Israel. The group was banned by the Syrian-dominated government and decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> arms to become a traditional political party. It remains banned, and is only a minor force in national life. Still, some of the rhetoric used by the LRP in advocating its domestic policies was revived during the Cedar Revolution in 2005, which forced {{the withdrawal of}} Syria from Lebanon and led to expectations of political reform.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2007 Noman Benotman, {{described}} as the [...] "ex-head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group", published on open letter to al-Qaeda.According to The Times:"In November last year Noman Benotman, ex-head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group {{which is trying to}} overthrow the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, published a letter which asked Al-Qaeda <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> all <b>its</b> operations in the Islamic world and in the West, adding that ordinary westerners were blameless and should not be attacked." ...|$|R
50|$|In response, the Libyan {{government}} and its supporters stated that Libya returned to the international community, got a temporary United Nations Security Council seat, and saved some money due <b>to</b> it <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> nuclear weapons program. Likewise, in an Al-Sharq al-Awsat interview, Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam stated that the United States did offer security guarantees for Libya in exchange for dismantling its nuclear program and that he expected military and security cooperation agreements with the U.S. in the future.|$|R
50|$|From 2007 until 2014, ESPN was {{the home}} of the renamed Nationwide Series. Generally four races per season aired on ABC, with the {{remainder}} on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPNews. Early in ESPN's run, ESPN Classic was used for NNS overflow, however with less carriage of that network, this practice ended. Fox Sports did make a return to the series, airing the 2011 Bubba Burger 250 at Richmond on Speed Channel, due <b>to</b> ESPN <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> exclusive rights <b>to</b> the race because of programming conflicts.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{the north}} of the country, some of the bloodiest {{fighting}} since 2001 took place after the LTTE launched massive attacks on Sri Lanka Army defence lines in the Jaffna peninsula on August 11. The LTTE used a force of 400 to 500 fighters in the attacks which consisted of land and amphibious assaults, and also fired a barrage of artillery at government positions, including the key military airbase at Palali. Initially, the Tigers broke through army defense lines around Muhamalai, and advanced further north, but they were halted after 10 hours of fierce fighting. Isolated battles continued over the next few days, but the LTTE was forced <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> offensive due to heavy casualties.|$|E
25|$|The Abbasid Revolution {{has been}} of great {{interest}} to both Western and Muslim historians. According to State University of New York professor of sociology Saïd Amir Arjomand, analytical interpretations of the revolution are rare, with most discussions simply lining up behind either the Iranic or Arabic interpretation of events. Frequently, early European historians viewed the conflict solely as a non-Arab uprising against Arabs. Bernard Lewis, professor emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, points out that while the revolution has often been characterized as a Persian victory and Arab defeat, the caliph was still Arab, the language of administration was still Arabic and Arab nobility was not forced <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> land holdings; rather, the Arabs were merely forced to share the fruits of the empire equally with other races.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{served on}} the Virginia governor's Council of State from 1777 to 1779, at which point {{he was elected to}} the Congress of the Confederation. The country faced a {{difficult}} war against Great Britain, as well as runaway inflation, financial troubles, and lack of cooperation between the different levels of government. Madison worked to make himself an expert on financial issues, becoming deeply involved in congressional committees, becoming a legislative workhorse and a master of parliamentary coalition building. Frustrated by the failure of the states to supply needed requisitions, Madison proposed a standing army, a permanent navy, and the ability of Congress to compel states to meet their war-time obligations. Madison also persuaded Virginia <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> claims to northwestern territories—consisting of most of modern-day Ohio and points west—to the Continental Congress. After serving Congress from 1781 to 1783, Madison won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784.|$|E
50|$|The Revolution of 1905 in Russia {{had a major}} {{effect on}} {{northern}} Iran and, in 1906, Iranian liberals and revolutionaries, demanded a constitution in Iran. In 1909 the revolutionaries forced the crown <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> some of <b>its</b> powers. Yeprem Khan, an ethnic Armenian, was an important figure of the Persian Constitutional Revolution.|$|R
500|$|Beginning in the 1930s, Imperial Japan {{attempted}} {{to expand its}} territory into China. [...] Opposed to these aggressive actions, the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands froze Japanese assets and imposed economic restrictions which prohibited the exportation of aircraft fuel as well as steel and iron to Japan, affecting 90% of Japan's war production needs. [...] Japan was forced <b>to</b> either <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> expansion plans or find alternative raw materials to continue producing equipment for the war. [...] Japan chose to continue with its plans, but decided it needed to neutralize any threat from the United States first.|$|R
5000|$|Historian Joseph Rayback {{traces the}} {{conservative}} {{turn of the}} WFM {{to the loss of}} a strike in Goldfield, Nevada, where many of the Cripple Creek miners had migrated after their defeat in the Colorado Labor Wars. While the Colorado governor had mobilized the national guard, the governor of Nevada called for federal troops, which this time [...] "reduced leadership to despair" [...] and forced the WFM rank and file <b>to</b> finally <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> radical leanings. By 1911, the WFM once again affiliated with the AFL. Thus ended the WFM's decade long flirtation with revolutionary sentiments.|$|R
25|$|Within {{three years}} {{following}} the end of the Second World War, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon became independent realms within the Commonwealth (then still called Dominions), though it was made clear at the time that India would soon move to a republican form of government. Unlike the Republic of Ireland and Burma {{at the time of their}} becoming republics, however, there was no desire on the part of India <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> membership in the British Commonwealth, prompting a Commonwealth Conference and the issuance of the London Declaration in April 1949, which entrenched the idea of Canadian prime minister Louis St. Laurent that different royal houses and republics be allowed in the Commonwealth so long as they recognised as the international organisation's symbolic head the shared sovereign of the United Kingdom and the Dominions. Shortly before the London Declaration, Newfoundland, which had remained a Dominion in name only, had become a province of Canada.|$|E
25|$|The immense {{size of the}} Union army (the largest on {{the planet}} {{toward the end of}} the Civil War), however, was viewed with {{increasing}} concern by Maritimers throughout the early 1860s. Another concern was the rising threat of Fenian raids on border communities in New Brunswick by those seeking to end British rule of Ireland. This combination of events, coupled with an ongoing decline in British military and economic support to the region as the Home Office favoured newer colonial endeavours in Africa and elsewhere, led to a call among Maritime politicians for a conference on Maritime Union, to be held in early September 1864 in Charlottetown – chosen in part because of Prince Edward Island's reluctance <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> jurisdictional sovereignty in favour of uniting with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into a single colony. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia felt that if the union conference were held in Charlottetown, they might be able to convince Island politicians to support the proposal.|$|E
25|$|The Munich Agreement of 1938 did {{not last}} for long. In March 1939 the German {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia began with the invasion of Bohemia and Moravia, leaving Slovakia as a German puppet state. Lithuania was forced <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> Klaipėda Region (Memelland). Formal demands were made {{for the return of}} the Free City of Danzig to Germany, even though its status was guaranteed by the League of Nations. In early 1939 Hitler proposed Poland an alliance on German terms, with an expectation of compliance. The Polish government would have to agree to Danzig's incorporation by the Reich and to an extraterritorial highway passage connecting East Prussia with the rest of Germany through the so-called Polish Corridor (an area linking the Polish mainland with the Baltic Sea). Poland would join an anti-Soviet alliance and coordinate its foreign policy with Germany, thus becoming a client state. The independence-minded Polish government was alarmed and a British guarantee of Poland's independence was issued on 31 March 1939. Reacting to this act and to Poland's effective rejection of the German demands, Hitler renounced the existing German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact on April 28.|$|E
30|$|In {{spite of}} private sector appearance, since China's {{industry}} is traditionally over-influenced {{by the government}} intention in a state-owned system, the government finds it difficult <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> any of <b>its</b> authority to control other institutions, even the market. This overwhelming power not only results in corruption but also distorts the ‘market economy’ into a ‘state monopoly’ economy.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{when the}} Charlotte Parks Commission was underfunded and mostly powerless, intense {{industrial}} development on West Morehead Street forced Bryant Park <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> much of <b>its</b> original space. Today {{the park is}} less than half its original size. Bryant Park remains the only public green space in Charlotte’s West Morehead Street industrial sector.|$|R
40|$|The authors aim at {{constructing}} {{an agent}} that learns appropriate actions in a Multi-Agent environment {{with and without}} social dilemmas. The agent ought <b>to</b> voluntarily <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> profit in a dilemma situation and it should keep its profit in another situation. We divide the environment into three situations and introduce reward-handling manners for learning actions, which are effective in each situation. Since the agent must select an effective manner for the situation, the authors contrive criteria for recognizing the situation. This paper shows that the agent having the manners and the criteria acts well {{in two of the}} three Multi-Agent situations composed of homogeneous agents...|$|R
