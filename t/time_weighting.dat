For women, the disutility of walking to access public transport is in general lower when walking in physical environments characterised by factors creating openness and in daylight. Women‟s value of walking time relative to in vehicle travel time is found to be 1. 2 in an open type-environment in daylight but 2. 0 in a closed type-environment in daylight.
