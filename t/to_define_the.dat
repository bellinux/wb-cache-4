Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments. He added that some guidelines could be needed to allow judges <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> issue of the dangerousness of the accused.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} candela, all the base units will {{be defined in}} terms of {{universal}} physical constants, but without an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the constants and the base units. Thus six physical constants will be needed <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> six base units.|$|E
5|$|First-order axiomatizations of Peano {{arithmetic}} have {{an important}} limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot {{be done in the}} more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.|$|E

5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the Know Nothings, and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|The East German {{government}} sought <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> {{country as}} a legitimate state {{in its own right}} and portrayed West Germany as enemy territory (feindliches Ausland)– a capitalist, semi-fascist state that exploited its citizens, sought to regain the lost territories of the Third Reich, and stood opposed to the peaceful socialism of the GDR.|$|E

5|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to review children's books seriously and with a distinctive set of criteria. Trimmer's reviews were carefully thought out; they influenced publishers and authors to alter {{the content of their}} books, helped <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> new genre of children's literature, and greatly affected the sales of children's books. The Guardian also offered the first history of children's literature; establishing a list of landmark books, which scholars still use today.|$|E
5|$|The Ramones were an American {{punk rock}} band that {{formed in the}} New York City {{neighborhood}} of Forest Hills, Queens, in 1974.

5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, S. Gill (Ferranti) {{discussed}} {{parallel programming}} {{and the need}} for branching and waiting. Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch. In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference. It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> limit of speed-up due to parallelism.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations {{are limited to}} two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer {{as they do in}} many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> scope of underage drinking laws.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|N-88 was unofficially {{designated}} around 1937, connecting from N-29, to N-86 and N-19 in Bridgeport. The route {{remained relatively}} {{the same as}} the state highway system was officially designated. Before 1955, Nebraska did not have an adequate legal instrument <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> state highway system. By 1960, N-19 was renumbered to US 385, and US 26 was rerouted north near Bridgeport. The old alignment became part of N-92. Two years later, N-29 was renumbered to N-71. Between 1981-82, a road appeared on the official state map, extending from WYO 151 to N-71. That road became part of N-88 by 1986. No significant changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used <b>to</b> <b>define</b> <b>the</b> Revueltian land {{vertebrate}} faunachron. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that {{is defined by the}} first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, which happens to be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus and the start of the Apachean LVF.|$|E
