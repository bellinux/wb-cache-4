5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> {{to wait until}} the harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E
25|$|However, the Oregon crew did not {{immediately}} head back north, as Gale <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to wait the winter out and attempt to recruit more people for the overland journey. Kilbourne then dropped out and decided to stay. Meanwhile, Gale sent out several circulars to attempt to recruit more people to settle in Oregon. Once spring came and the crew gathered at Cash Creek there were now a total of 42 people ready to head north to Oregon Country.|$|E

25|$|In March 1657, an Ottoman Armada emerged {{through the}} Dardanelles, {{slipping}} through a Venetian blockade, {{with the objective}} of retaking the island but did not attempt to do so, concerned by the Venetian fleet. In July 1657, Pasha made a decision to break the Venetian blockade and retake the territory. The Peace Party in the Venetian senate <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to not defend Tenedos, and Lemnos, and debated this with the War Party. Pasha ended the argument by recapturing Tenedos on 31 August 1657, in the Battle of the Dardanelles (1657), the fourth and final one.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Augustus placed Germanicus, {{the son of}} Drusus, {{in charge}} of the forces of the Rhine and he after dealing with a mutiny of the troops {{proceeded}} against the Cherusci and their allies, breaking their power finally at the battle of Idistavisus, a plain on the Weser. All eight legions and supporting units of Gauls were required to do that. Germanicus' zeal led finally to his being replaced (17 AD) by his cousin Drusus, Tiberius' son, as Tiberius <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to follow his predecessor's policy of limiting the empire. Germanicus certainly would have involved the Suebi, with unpredictable results.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, seeing {{no threat}} of relief Maurice {{returned}} to the siege. Mining and sapping continued for the besiegers - their pioneers and engineers constructed dams that cut off the canal that fed the ditch lines which were dug up to it from which the water was drained. This resulted in the problem of lack of fresh water for the garrison in the city. Some of them <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> that they should make terms with Maurice but van den Bergh refused. He had the confidence that Francisco Verdugo together with other Spanish commanders would provide the relief of the city.|$|E

25|$|A year later, {{buoyed by}} {{excellent}} results {{and a silver}} medal prize in the Apothecaries' yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital, where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones, Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at University College London. Jones had been Robert Knox's assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare. The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to leave Scotland. He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating {{the existence of a}} hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley's layer. No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor.|$|E

[...] The next day, acting Treasury Secretary William L. Hodge approved Longacre's design.

500|$|On October 14, 1969, the {{day before}} the anti-war Moratorium, North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong {{released}} a letter supporting demonstrations in the United States. Nixon resented this, but on the advice of his aides, <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to say nothing, and instead had Agnew give a press conference at the White House, calling upon the Moratorium protesters to disavow the support of the North Vietnamese. Agnew handled the task well, and Nixon tasked Agnew with attacking the Democrats generally, while remaining above the fray himself. This was analogous to the role Nixon had performed as vice president in the Eisenhower White House, thus Agnew was dubbed [...] "Nixon's Nixon". Agnew had finally found a role in the Nixon administration, one he enjoyed very much.|$|E
500|$|During the 12 {{days that}} {{he watched the}} court-martial proceedings, Thurgood Marshall began to {{formulate}} an appeal campaign. Marshall had noticed {{that none of the}} men's grievances had been aired in court. Directly after the court closed the case, Marshall sent a letter to Secretary Forrestal asking why only blacks were assigned the task of loading munitions; why had they not been trained for that task; why were they forced to compete for speed; why were they not given survivor's leaves; and why had they not been allowed to rise in rank. Forrestal replied weakly, saying that a predominance of black men were stationed at Port Chicago so of course they would be working there to load munitions. Forrestal pointed out that there was no discrimination because other naval weapons stations were manned by white crews loading munitions. The Navy Secretary said that the men had not been promoted because their time at Port Chicago had been a [...] "trial period", and that they were not given 30-day leaves because he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> for men to get quickly back to duty to prevent them from building up mental and emotional barriers.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Elgar was in poor health. His wife <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a {{house near}} Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, but as we do not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type." ...|$|E

500|$|Although the {{popularity}} of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by Bai Juyi. Murasaki taught Chinese to Shōshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Shōshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, {{was one of the few}} women available to teach Shōshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was [...] "almost subversive" [...] that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Shōshi. Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, [...] "Since last summer... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to be no one about, I have been reading with Her Majesty... There has of course been no question of formal lessons... I have <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to say nothing about the matter to anybody." ...|$|E

He was prepared to go alone when Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet volunteered to go with him. They worked their way slowly upriver until they came upon an abandoned, destroyed village. They found clothing and an abandoned sampan, which they used to disguise themselves as fishermen. They rowed quietly up river, {{but even in the}} pitch dark and dense fog they could see large numbers of North Vietnamese soldiers and tanks on the shoreline. Stopping to check his map at one point, Norris suddenly realized that two NVA soldiers were sitting about [...] away. Fortunately, they were asleep. Traveling upriver in the sampam, they broke out of the heavy fog and found themselves under the Cam Lo bridge. They had passed Hambleton’s position more than 30 minutes ago. Turning around, they worked their way south before putting ashore and began to search for Hambleton. They finally found him sitting in a clump of bushes, alive but partly delirious and extremely weakened, having eaten only four small ears of corn in 12 days and having lost [...] since his plane was shot down. He weighed only [...] Sunrise was coming, and although Norris <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to wait until dark to return downriver, Hambleton needed to be evacuated immediately.

2500|$|Both {{sides of}} the debate have {{suggested}} other reasons, including associations with various styles of Latin letters (namely, the /g/ in /-ing/, often written with a bottom-loop in script) and the effect of letter-height on the coastlines of words, but whether Read considered any of these is uncertain. Since the letter representing the same sound in Read's Quikscript appears identical to [...] "Hung", it is doubtful that Read reversed the letter twice by mistake—he may have <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to leave things as they were, mistake or not, especially as a corrected /ng/ might in hasty or careless writing be confused with his new letter for /n/ in Quikscript.|$|E
