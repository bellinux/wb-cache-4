5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, {{research}} into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, and had only produced objects <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both uranium-235 and plutonium, and implosion technology would not be required.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the research vessel Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again very poor, but all 14 of the targets were successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out of the sky and invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E
5|$|Gimmick! is a {{platform}} game that places the player {{in control of}} a small green blob named Yumetaro. The story begins during an unnamed young girl's birthday. Her father is normally busy with work but {{he is able to}} spend time with his family for the special occasion. Earlier, he had went to the store to purchase a new toy for his daughter. Yumetaro had been wandering the toy store and became confused when the father came in. He hid with stuffed toys <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> him, but was picked up by the girl's father. When the girl opens the Yumetaro gift, she is delighted. Yumetaro becomes the girl's favorite, and so her other toys no longer feel loved. One night, the toys come alive and take the girl to another dimension. The only one left is Yumetaro, who follows the toys in search of the girl.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E

5|$|While Hesperornis is {{not thought}} to have left descendants, the {{earliest}} modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called Tytthostonyx glauconiticus, which seems allied to the Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes. In the Paleogene the seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus Puffinus (which includes today's Manx shearwater and sooty shearwater) might {{date back to the}} Oligocene. The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. At the end of the latter, the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.|$|E
5|$|Extra time {{provided}} little action; {{the only}} player <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> changing the scoreline was Conti, whose runs at Neal caused the Liverpool defender problems. Despite this, the score remained the same through the 30 minutes of extra time and the match went to a penalty-shoot-out. Liverpool {{were the first to}} take a penalty, but Nicol put his shot over the crossbar. Graziani stepped up to take Roma's first penalty, but Roma captain Agostino Di Bartolomei took the ball from him and took the penalty instead, scoring to give Roma the lead. Liverpool's next penalty was taken by their regular penalty taker Neal who scored to level the shoot-out. Conti took the next penalty for Roma, but like Nicol he put his shot over the crossbar. Souness and Ubaldo Righetti converted their respective penalties to make the scoreline2–2. Rush scored Liverpool's next penalty to make the score 3–2. Graziani stepped up again to take Roma's fourth penalty. While he was placing the ball on the penalty spot, Liverpool goalkeeper Grobbelaar was wobbling his legs in the Liverpool goal, hoping to distract Graziani. The tactic appeared to have worked as Graziani placed his penalty over the crossbar. Alan Kennedy was the next player to take a penalty and if he scored Liverpool would win the match. Kennedy scored the penalty sending Tancredi the wrong way. Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2, thereby winning their fourth European Cup.|$|E

Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
