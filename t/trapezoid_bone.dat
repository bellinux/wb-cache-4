40|$|A 17 -year-old {{right-handed}} Caucasian man {{attended the}} Emergency Department after {{landing on the}} out-stretched left hand when thrown during a martial arts class. He had no previous symptoms of pain or stiffness affecting the left wrist. On examination there was tenderness and deformity of the left distal radius consis-tent with a displaced fracture confirmed by plain radio-graphs. Coalitions between the lunate and triquetrum, and capitate and <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bones,</b> were incidental findings. The fracture was manipulated into an anatom-ical position and immobilised in a cast for 6 weeks at which point active mobilisation of the wrist was started.

5000|$|The <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> (lesser multangular bone) is a carpal bone in tetrapods, {{including}} humans. It is {{the smallest}} bone in the distal row. It may be known by its wedge-shaped form, the broad end of the wedge constituting the dorsal, the narrow end the palmar surface; and by its having four articular facets touching each other, and separated by sharp edges. It is homologous with the [...] "second distal carpal" [...] of reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
40|$|Isolated {{fracture}} of the <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> {{is due to}} axial loading on the outstretched palm and extended wrist, transmitted through the second metacarpal bone. Traumatic lesions of <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> are rare because of its well-protected position in the wrist and hence missed in the past. The modern diagnostic modalities have made its diagnosis more frequent. The ability of wrist to place the hand in 3 -dimensional space is essential for normal daily function of the upper extremity. Some wrist injuries remain a diagnostic enigma, while others remain frustrating to treat either conservatively or with operative intervention. Isolated fractures of the <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> are rarely reported in the literature. We report a case of an isolated, non-displaced <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> fracture, which sustained injury by direct trauma and treated conservatively by a cast with return of normal functions...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carpal synostoses are {{congenital}} defects {{characterized by}} complete or incomplete coalition {{of two or}} more carpal bones. Although most of these defects are discovered only incidentally, sometimes they become clinically manifest. Among the different types of carpal coalition, the synostosis between capitate and <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bones</b> is quite rare, with only sparse data available in the literature. The aim of this report was to describe a case of capitate-trapezoid synostosis observed in an ancient human skeleton, as well as to scrutinize the pertinent literature in order to assess for the characteristics of this type of defect, including its potential relevance to clinical practice. METHODS: We studied the skeletal remains of an Early Bronze Age male warrior affected by incomplete capitate-trapezoid synostosis. Macroscopical and radiological examination of the defect was carried out. We also performed a comprehensive PubMed search in the Medline and other specialty literature databases to retrieve and analyze data relevant to the subject under consideration. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The present case is the most ancient capitate-trapezoid synostosis ever found. In those literature-reported cases accompanied by careful anatomical description, such as the present one, incomplete coalition invariably occurs between the dorsal surfaces of the two bones, this characteristic emerging as a distinctive morphological trait. Literature analysis further suggests that the true prevalence of capitate-trapezoid synostosis is likely to be higher than estimates based on data gathered from radiology series, and that this defect may be associated with pain and carpal bossing more frequently than generally thought...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{skeletal}} peripheral metastases {{below the}} elbow and the knee are rare. Skeletal metastases to the hand or foot are very rare; {{but when they}} do {{it may be a}} revealing clinical finding. Purely lytic lesions are commonly seen in metastases from lung, renal, and thyroid tumors, but they are also known to occur in primary myeloma, brown tumor and lymphomas. A 70 -year-old man was brought to the emergency department with acute painful swelling involving his right hand and the right knee. Due to significant accompanying soft tissue swellings cellulitis, acute osteomyelitis and gouty arthropathy were included in the initial differential diagnosis. Radiographs showed pure lytic bony lesion with complete disappearance of lower two third of the second metacarpal, trapezium and <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bones</b> of the right hand along with a lytic subarticular lesion of medial condyle of ipsilateral femur. Chest X-ray (CXR) was normal but sonography of the abdomen readily demonstrated a large renal mass, later confirmed at biopsy as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Clinicians should be cognizant of the strong association between digital acrometastases and renal cell carcinoma in male patients with normal CXR findings. In suspected hand acrometastasis associated with a soft tissue component outside the contours of normal bone, screening the abdomen by sonography should be done prior to bone biopsy and before costly or time-consuming investigations are offered. Metastatic RCC {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of all unilateral expansile bony lesions of the digit. It is particularly important if such lesion/lesions are accompanied by local inflammation. Screening the abdomen by sonography may be of particular value in such elderly male patient when Chest X-ray shows no abnormality...|$|R
40|$|The authors report {{two cases}} of isolated, undisplaced, {{fractures}} of the <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone.</b> Because of its well-protected {{position in the}} wrist, traumatic lesions of the <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> are rare. Dislocation of the trapezoid {{has been reported in}} 30 patients; fractures are seen even less frequently and usually go with dorsal displacement. To our knowledge and based on a Medline literature review, only two cases of acute and isolated, undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures of the trapezoid have been previously described. We believe that the lesion has often been missed in the past and modern diagnostic tools will make its diagnosis far more frequent. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A 45 -year-old woman {{presented}} to the emergency department with left wrist pain following a fall. Physical exam was remarkable for soft tissue swelling of the palmar and dorsal hand, point tenderness {{at the base of}} the second metacarpal, and limited active range of motion. Three-view wrist radiographs showed significant soft tissue swelling without evidence of fracture or dislocation. Computed tomography obtained due to concern for an occult fracture revealed a comminuted fracture of the <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> involving the articular surface with an anteriorly displaced bone fragment (Figures 1 and 2). The patient was placed in a sugar-tong splint and given orthopedic follow up. Fractures of the <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone</b> are rare, accounting for 0. 4 % of carpal fractures. 1 This is primarily due to its protected position in the wrist, nestled within strong intercarpal ligaments between the surrounding carpal bones and the base of the second metacarpal. Its position and integrity contribute vitally to the carpal arch, but make detection of injury elusive. 1, 2 Fractures are rarely isolated, often involving fractures of the second metacarpal base. 2 Patients may have second metacarpal base tenderness, ‘‘snuffbox’ ’ tenderness, 3 or pain with axial loading of the second digit 4 after trauma involving an axial or bending force along the second metacarpal. The overlapping bones and intimate articulations of the wrist make plain radiographs difficult to interpret. 1, 5 In 2 separate reports reviewing 17 trapezoid fractures, only 1 fracture was diagnosed by plain radiographs; all others required advanced imaging. 6, 7 In 1 study, 30 % of wrist fractures missed by plain radiograph were diagnosed by computed tomography. 5 Treatment approaches have varied from cast immobilization to open reduction and internal fixation, depending on degree of displacement and integrity of the carpal arch. 1, 6 Unrecognize...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Low- to intermediate-grade {{chondrosarcoma}} {{is usually}} a slow-growing and highly chemotherapyresistant tumor type. CASE REPORT: The 76 -year-old female patient presented with low- to intermediate-grade chondrosarcoma of the distal phalanx of the right thumb in 1993 and was treated with an excision of the carpometacarpal joint. Approximately 10 years later, the patient presented with recurrent local disease at the <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bone,</b> which was resected. Eight months later she presented with local recurrence at the carpal joint and lung metastases. Subsequently she was treated chemotherapeutically with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin {{as part of a}} clinical trial. Due to tumor progression after 2 cycles, she was switched to oral trofosfamide (150 mg daily). A follow-up CT scan after 8 months demonstrated a partial remission that was confirmed by a second scan after 9 months of treatment. The treatment was well tolerated. After 18 months of continued treatment, she was still in remission and on trofosfamide. CONCLUSION: Trofosfamide at a daily dose of 150 mg may be effective in low- to intermediate-grade chondrosarcoma. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Anatomy {{has been}} at the {{foundation}} of medical students' training. In recent decades, medical programs in many countries have undergone major reform in both pedagogy and content. These reforms generated intense debates, focusing mainly on the way the new programs affected medical graduates' knowledge of anatomy and their clinical capabilities. Anatomy, however, is not only core to medicine, but also to a number of allied and complementary health disciplines. While the evaluation of anatomy teaching and learning in the medical programs has been heavily scrutinized, anatomy education in the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) professions, including those, such as chiropractic, in which anatomy has traditionally been one of the main preclinical subjects, has been less frequently evaluated. Objectives: The study aimed to make a preliminary assessment of the final year chiropractic students' knowledge of anatomy using the "carpal bone test. " Subjects and methods: The testing was conducted on the final-year chiropractic students at Macquarie University in 2009. In this test, the students were given 5 minutes to label an illustration of the bony skeleton of the carpal region. The results of this assessment were then compared to results of previously published surveys using the "carpal bone test. " Results: A total of 84 students participated in the study. Thirty-eight percent (38 %) of students identified a ll eight bones, while 60 % of students identified five or more carpal bones. The most frequent correctly identified bone was the pisiform, followed by the scaphoid bone (82 % and 74 % of students, respectively). The trapezium and <b>trapezoid</b> <b>bones</b> were least frequently identified: both by 52 % of students each. These results were generally better than those of the previously tested final-year medical students. Discussion and conclusions: The importance of anatomy in chiropractors' education has been generally acknowledged. This study suggests that the comparatively high number of hours devoted to anatomy in Macquarie University chiropractic curriculum and underpinning of clinical skills to anatomy knowledge in the senior year have increased retention of anatomy knowledge. The study, preliminary in nature, has also recognized the need for more detailed assessment of teaching and learning of the basic medical sciences in chiropractic and other CAM disciplines. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Fracture-dislocation of the trapezio-scaphoid joint is an {{extremely}} rare injury. We report a case treated using Herbert’s compression screw technique. Complete fracture-dislocation of the trapezium from its proximal articulations with the <b>trapezoid</b> and scaphoid <b>bones</b> has previously been reported in only eight cases, according to Brewood (1985). He reviewed the previously described cases and reported one more. Table 1 shows the salient features of all these patients and our own. Dorso-radial dislocation of the trapezium has only once before been described (Boe 1979). The rarity of the injury can be explained on anatomical grounds. Haines, (1944), in describing the detailed anatomy of the ligaments of the first carpo-metacarpal joint, pointed out the extra strength of the dorsal as opposed to th...|$|R
40|$|Opening wedge {{osteotomy}} of the trapezial saddle {{was reported}} first by Kapandji and Heim (2002) {{as a possible}} surgical treatment for early trapeziometacarpal joint arthritis. This study evaluates the feasibility and anatomical risks of the procedure. Ten upper limbs from fresh cadavers were used for this anatomical and radiological study. A dorsolateral opening wedge osteotomy with a 10 correction was performed on each specimen. CT scans and AP radiographs of all the wrists were performed before and after osteotomy to assess the correction of the slope angle, defined as the angle between the longitudinal axis of the second metacarpal and the axis of the trapeziometacarpal articulation. On standard radiographs, mean trapezial slope was 126 preoperatively and 117 postoperatively. On sagittal and coronal CT reconstructions, one case of trapezial translation and two impingements between <b>trapezoid</b> and trapezium <b>bones</b> were identified. Trapezial osteotomy is technically demanding with several possible complications, but merits further study for young patients with Eaton stage 1 or 2 osteoarthritis and an abnormal trapezial slope...|$|R
