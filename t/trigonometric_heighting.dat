In general, these elevation differences will not be as accurate as those obtained from spirit/differential levels.

40|$|High {{precision}} geoid models HKGEOID- 2000 for Hong Kong and SZGEOID- 2000 for Shenzhen, China, {{have been}} developed with a hybrid approach of so-called sequential processing, using high precision GPS/leveling data, land and sea gravity anomalies, and digital terrain models. These two local geoid models have the same 1 -km resolution. The estimated accuracy (external accuracy) is better than 1. 7 cm for HKGEOID- 2000 and 1. 4 cm for SZGEOID- 2000. Some common areas are covered by HKGEOID- 2000 and SZGEOID- 2000. So these two geoid models, along with high quality GPS/leveling data collected on the overlapping areas, {{can be used to}} detect the systematic bias between HKGEOID- 2000 and SZGEOID- 2000, as well as the difference between Hong Kong Principal Datum and 1956 yellow sea height datum of China, yielding RMS errors of 1. 011 m and 1, 003 m, respectively. Moreover, HKGEOID- 2000, along with GPS ellipsoidal heights, is employed to determine the errors of the ?orthometric heights? from purely <b>trigonometric</b> <b>heighting,</b> yielding an RMS error of 0. 102 m. The combination of SZGEOID- 2000 and GPS ellipsoidal heights has been used to replace the traditional spirit leveling and mapping, called GPS mapping.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{empirical}} studies have investigated the characteristics of terrestrial refraction. However, only few of these are concerned with short-term fluctuations of refraction influences. The aim of the present work is to analyze the short-term characteristics (amplitudes and variations at scales of minutes to hours) of terrestrial refraction in the lower atmosphere around 1. 8 m above the grass surface. We apply the known method of simultaneous reciprocal vertical angle measurements to derive time series of the refraction coefficient k as a measure for refraction. Our study uses a new setup of two pairs of total stations for parallel observations of the refraction coefficient along adjacent lines of sight. Such a controlled experiment not only allows us to determine refraction coefficients independently but also to assess measurement errors from the residuals between refraction coefficient pairs. Over five observation days {{in the summer of}} 2008, a total of 33 h of parallel observation data of the refraction coefficient were collected at sampling frequencies of 1 min. On one observation day, unique parallel observations of the refraction coefficient along three lines of sight with a total of six total stations were possible. For mostly sunny days, we found wave-like and sawtooth-like fluctuations of the refraction coefficient with amplitudes of 1 – 1. 5 at time scales of 10 – 30 min. On cloudy days, the amplitudes of fluctuations were on the order of 0. 5. Our refraction experiments show a variation range of k between − 4 and + 16 near the ground on sunny summer days. This equates to vertical temperature gradients between − 0. 5 and − 0. 1 K/m during the day and 1 – 2 K/m shortly after sunset. Cloud cover reduces the variability of k to a range of − 2 to + 5. Our results show that the frequently used Gaussian refraction coefficient of + 0. 13 is not suited for describing refraction effects in the lower atmosphere. As a conclusion, our results may be helpful to better assess the role of refraction in near-ground precision surveys, such as geometric levelling or <b>trigonometric</b> <b>heighting...</b>|$|E

50|$|Maoile Lunndaidh is a {{large and}} remote mountain, {{covering}} an area in excess of 10 square miles (2,590 hectares). Its location is almost equidistant from the valleys of Strathconon, Strathfarrar and Glen Carron, the nearest public road being over 10 km away. The mountain is listed in the current edition of Munro's Tables as 1007 metres (3304 feet). This height dates from {{the introduction of the}} 1:50k OS map series in the 1970s.

40|$|Levelling and <b>trigonometric</b> <b>height</b> {{measurements}} are the methods that are mostly used today for height determination, {{as the standard}} error with these methods is in the magnitude of millimeters, {{as long as the}} view length is less than 50 m. When creating a new construction map the requirement on standard error differ from 1 (Fredriksson, 2011) to 10 cm (www. arvidsjaur. se) depending on which municipality it concerns. When using network RTK for measuring, the accuracy in height can fall below 3 cm when the conditions are optimal. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate if network RTK can be used as an alternative to determinate height when accuracy under 10 cm is requested. Five points at locations with different conditions for accuracy got their height determined with the three methods mentioned above. Positional accuracy was formed for each point and method. The result from levelling was used as reference for the calculations. To compare the result with the requirements extended standard uncertainty, 2 covering 95 %, was used. The result from <b>trigonometric</b> <b>height</b> measurement shows a position accuracy of 4 mm. From the network RTK, the points that were positioned without interference got a positional accuracy of 3. 3 to 5. 5 cm, while the points that were influenced by their environment, multipath interference and obstructions, got a positional accuracy of 123. 3 cm and 234. 4 cm. Positional accuracy of this method became 127. 4 cm. The result from the height determination with network RTK shows big difference in accuracy for the different points. The conclusion is that network RTK measurement would not be a sufficiently accurate height determination method for preparation of a new construction map in an area similar to the one used for this test. Conversely, a construction map drawn up in an open area free from interference obstacles the results show that the network RTK is an approved method for determining height, depending on the requirements of the municipality...|$|R

This results in not only an estimate of the model order, but also an estimate of peak locations and heights with much smaller bias and variation than that found in a direct trigonometric moment estimate. A more e cient maximum likelihood estimate can be calculated from these estimates using a Gauss-Newton algorithm. We also present some relevant results concerning the spectral structure of Toeplitz matrices which playakey role in the estimation.
