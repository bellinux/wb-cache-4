5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> in the later seasons.

James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours with the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.|$|E

The Mega Drive version of Battletoads features <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> difficulty, {{as well as providing}} higher definition and more colourful graphics as opposed to the NES version. The Game Gear port features downscaled graphics, also removing three levels and the two-player mode.|$|E
5|$|Republicans in Congress {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E

5|$|The Polish {{government}} {{agreed to}} Beck's proposal, and the ultimatum was <b>toned</b> <b>down.</b> However, {{at the same}} time, Beck ordered military preparations. Poland assembled four divisions along the demarcation line; about 50,000 Polish troops were present, and just over 20,000 Lithuanian troops. The Polish troops were reinforced by armored vehicles, by two air force regiments, consisting of about one hundred aircraft, and by the Polish fleet {{in the waters of}} the Baltic Sea along the Lithuanian shore.|$|E
5|$|The entire cast {{from the}} {{previous}} games has been replaced with new characters. CO powers have been <b>toned</b> <b>down,</b> and no longer affect all units or the whole battle or the whole map. Tag powers from Dual Strike which allowed players to move twice in one turn have been removed. Players gain CO powers much later in the campaign than before, {{and they have a}} much less significant role in overall gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} in the pre-climax sequences was <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> to match the sensibilities of the Telugu audience after Venkatesh expressed scepticism {{as to whether the}} audience would accept him getting beaten up badly in the police station. During set construction for the police station and the house in the film, the producer and the director {{wanted to get rid of}} some coconut trees.

5000|$|Vicki Lawrence {{has stated}} that at the {{beginning}} of Mama's Family, she detected that the writers had made adjustments to her character from [...] "The Family" [...] skits, significantly <b>toning</b> <b>down</b> Mama's hostilities and nastiness. Lawrence originally disfavored Mama's change in character from [...] "The Family" [...] sketches to the series version, believing that <b>toning</b> <b>down</b> the character's then familiar aggressions and spite in exchange for a less difficult, more agreeable nature, capable of humor and high spirits wasn't funny.|$|R

5|$|Two 1970s police dramas {{featured}} protagonists with pet cockatoos. In the 1973 film Serpico, Al Pacino's character had a pet {{white cockatoo}} {{and the television}} show Baretta saw Robert Blake's character with Fred the Triton cockatoo. The popularity of the latter show saw a corresponding rise in popularity of cockatoos as pets in the late 1970s. Cockatoos have been used frequently in advertising; a cockatoo appeared in a 'cheeky' (and later <b>toned</b> <b>down)</b> 2008 advertising campaign for Cockatoo Ridge Wineries.|$|E
5|$|A pop ballad, {{the song}} {{includes}} instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It {{is also about}} being strong, which Madonna recalled {{in an interview that}} she thought about her relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
5|$|According to interviews, the {{characters}} {{were chosen for}} their popularity, and for parallels between them from both universes. Boon has said that some of {{the characters}}' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> to make them balanced within Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic. Boon revealed that two new characters were developed as downloadable content, Quan Chi from Mortal Kombat and Harley Quinn from DC comics but had been discarded. He had also hinted earlier at the prospect of Kung Lao and Doomsday being downloadable characters.|$|E

Brawl, he is a playable character. However, Meta Knight was removed from professional gaming competitions in the United States and Canada due to being considered too powerful. Meta Knight returned as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U after the series' director, Masahiro Sakurai, assured some changes to re-add him; among the changes, Meta Knight lost his ability to glide, and his unrivaled attack speed was <b>toned</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spielberg first {{contacted}} screenwriter David Self {{to adapt}} the story into a feature film. Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel and leaving the core elements of the story. Some of the harsher aspects of the story were <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> as the script became more streamlined; for example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an alcoholic, but this element was ultimately absent from the final version.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario World was ported to the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 between 2001 and 2002.

Further differences include the inclusion of Luigi as a playable character and a <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> difficulty. In the United States, Super Mario Advance 2 sold 2.5 million copies and earned $74 million in revenue by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it became the second highest-selling portable game in that country. It received positive reviews from critics upon its release.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes were}} made in the second edition. Some of the social {{commentary}} regarding the poor treatment of Native Americans by the government was <b>toned</b> <b>down.</b> The name of the Native tribe was changed from the Orteils Ficelés ("Tied Toes") to the Pieds Noirs ("Black Feet"). Perhaps because Al Capone's power had diminished in the intervening years, Hergé depicted Capone's scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed the reference to Mary Pikeford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium were also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
