40|$|In our {{previous}} work, a scale-up fabrication approach to cost effectively manufacturing nano-gratings over large {{area has been}} developed through diamond turning by using a multi-tip diamond tool fabricated by Focus Ion Beam. The objective {{of this study is}} to gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of machining nanostructures on single crystal copper through diamond turning when using a single tip and a multi-tip nanoscale diamond tool. For this purpose atomistic models of a single <b>tip</b> <b>tool</b> for multi-pass cutting and a multi-tip tool for single-pass cutting were built, respectively. The nature of the cutting chip formation, dislocation nucleation and propagation, cutting forces, and temperature distribution during nanometric cutting processes were studied through MD simulations. Results show that nanostructure generation process at steady cutting stage was governed by a strong localization of the dislocation movement and the dynamic equilibrium of chip-tool contact area. Except the apparent improvement of machining efficiency that proportional to the tool tip numbers, the nano-grooves generated by multi-tip tool also have higher centre symmetry than those machined by single <b>tip</b> <b>tool.</b> While the average tangential cutting force per tip were calculated all around 33. 3 nN, a larger normal cutting force per tip being 54. 1 nN was observed when using a multi-tip tool. A concept of atomistic equivalent temperature was proposed and used to analysis the important features of temperature distribution during the machining process. The advantage, disadvantage and applicability of diamond turning using multi-tip tool were discussed in comparison with those of using single-tip tool. The findings suggest that diamond turning using multi-tip tool might be more applicable than using single <b>tip</b> <b>tool</b> when apply to scale-up fabrication of periodic nanostructures...|$|E

This paper presents an investigation of a scale-up manufacturing approach for nanostructures through diamond turning using a nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool (four <b>tip</b> <b>tool</b> with tip width of 150 nm) fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB). The manufacturing capacity of this new technique is evaluated {{through a series of}} cutting trials on copper substrates under different cutting conditions (depth of cut 100 – 500 nm, spindle speed 12 – 120 rpm). The machined surface roughness and nanostructure patterns are measured by using a white light interferometer and a scanning electron microscope, respectively. Results show that the form accuracy and integrity of the machined nanostructures were degraded with the increase of the depth of cut and the cutting speed. The burr and the structure damage are two major machining defects. High precision nano-grooves (form error of bottom width < 6. 7 %) was achieved when a small depth of cut of 100 nm was used (spindle speed[*]=[*] 12 rpm). Initial tool wear was found at both the clearance cutting edge and the side edges of tool tips after a cutting distance of 2. 5 km. Moreover, the nanometric cutting process was emulated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for determining the value of the elastic displacement that occurs when reaming and deployment of holes. The lack of theoretical studies of the analytical representation of the cutting force limits the study of conditions to improve the accuracy of hole machining. A promising direction should be considered a theoretical approach, which allows to determine the magnitude of the elastic displacement occurring in the technological system when drilling and thus to estimate the error handling holes. A further development of this approach is a theoretical analysis of the magnitude of the elastic displacement that occurs when processing multiple <b>tip</b> <b>tools</b> axial holes (core drills and reamers). In this paper, based on the analytic representation of cutting forces in machining holes axial multiple <b>tip</b> <b>tools</b> have received a new theoretical solution of the nature of changes in the magnitude of the elastic displacement occurring in the technological system and determining error processing holes. Calculations revealed, {{that in the case of}} misalignment of the hole axis tool with four or more blades magnitude of the elastic displacement remains constant, regardless of the position of the blades. However, the torque varies cyclically, giving rise to a torsional oscillation process system. Proved, that with increasing amounts of the variable part of the tool blades torque decreases. It follows from this promising application of axial multiple <b>tip</b> <b>tools</b> (reamers, reamers) with inclined blades, so as to avoid the time variation of torque and thus eliminate torsional vibrations in the technological system, that is essential for improving the accuracy of hole machining and surface finish clas...|$|R

The FSB process is applied on a machine that uses rotation tools (e. g., machining center or multi-tasking machine).

Here, we apply the FSB to the shaft materials of 0. 45 % C steel using a multi-tasking machine. In the FSB process, the burnishing tool rotates at a high-revolution speed. The thin surface layer is rubbed and stirred as the temperature is increased and decreased. With the FSB process, high hardness or compressive residual stress can be obtained on the surface layer. However, when we applied the FSB process using a 3 mm diameter sphere <b>tip</b> shape <b>tool,</b> the surface roughness increased substantially (Ra = 20 µm).
