5|$|With {{most of the}} Revie built team {{retiring}} {{or moving}} on to other clubs, Armfield had to rebuild the squad, though Bremner would still play 38 games in the 1975–76 campaign.

5|$|After {{undertaking}} {{a series}} of friendlies, Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield and drew 0–0 to share the honour. Defeats by Everton and Aston Villa {{set the tone for}} the league season as the team were left with much to do; a poor run of form during the Christmas and New Year period effectively ruled the team out of retaining the championship.

5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear {{because of a}} lack of official data.

5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians.
