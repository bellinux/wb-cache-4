5|$|In most chelicerates the pedipalps are {{relatively}} small and are used as sensors. However, those of male spiders have bulbous <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> act as syringes to inject sperm into the females' reproductive openings when mating, while scorpions' form large claws used for capturing prey.|$|E
5|$|The smooth spores {{are roughly}} elliptical, {{measuring}} 8–14 by 3–5μm; in maturity {{they have one}} cross-wall, and oil drops at either end. The asci (spore-bearing cells) measure 100–135 by 7–10μm. The paraphyses are shaped liked narrow cylinders with diameters up to 1.5μm, and have <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are rounded or somewhat club-shaped. β-Carotene is the predominant pigment responsible for the yellow color of the fruit body.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora anthocephala is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance, {{but can be}} distinguished by branches that taper upward, branch <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are flattened (instead of spoon-like), {{and the lack of}} a fetid odor. The North American species T.vialis has smaller spores and a more variable color. Darker Ramaria species are distinguished by their non-leathery flesh texture and pointy branch tips.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are bright {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure 20–25 by 12–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 225–325 by 15–22.5µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are rounded to club-shaped, and measure 150–275 by 7–15µm. Hyphal cells on sterile ridges are septate, measuring 100–175 by 10–25µm. They are tightly packed {{in an even}} layer. The terminal hyphae are club-shaped to somewhat rectangular with a flattened to broadly rounded tip.|$|E
5|$|Other {{lavender}} to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides, {{which is}} so multiply branched so as to appear toothed, and Clavulina amethystina, {{which can only be}} reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species. In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color {{as the rest of the}} fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than —could be mistaken for a small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E

Instead, the liquid is drawn into and dispensed from a disposable pipette <b>tip</b> <b>that</b> is changed between transfers. Depressing the tip ejector button removes the <b>tip,</b> <b>that</b> is cast off without being handled by the operator and disposed of safely in an appropriate container. This also prevents contamination of or damage to the calibrated measurement mechanism by the substances being measured.|$|R
5|$|Resident: These are {{the most}} {{commonly}} sighted of the three populations in the coastal waters of the northeast Pacific. Residents' diets consist primarily of fish and sometimes squid, and they live in complex and cohesive family groups called pods. Female residents characteristically have rounded dorsal fin <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> terminate in a sharp corner. They visit the same areas consistently. British Columbia and Washington resident populations are amongst the most intensively studied marine mammals anywhere in the world. Researchers have identified and named over 300 killer whales over the past 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} in shape, amyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of either 8–10 by 6–7µm or 10–14 by 6.7–8.5µm {{depending on whether}} they originated from four-or two-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant cheilocystidia on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12µm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are broadly rounded. They are filled with a purplish sap and have granular contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated cuticle, a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. Clamp connections in the hyphae are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The bat's upperparts are reddish-brown or grey, {{while the}} {{underside}} is generally paler. The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> allow the bat to hover. Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There {{is a large}} web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, {{although there are no}} tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.|$|E

5|$|The spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to elliptical, have {{a smooth}} surface, and dimensions of 8–11 to 3–4µm. There are both two- and four-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), {{and they are}} club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 28–36 by 10–12µm. Cystidia are plentiful, and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths (as cheilocystidia), or more commonly, singly {{along the sides of}} the tubes (as pleurocystidia). These structures are thin-walled, cylindrical, and measure 48–60 by 7–9µm. The scales on the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are clustered together. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Offshore: A third {{population}} of killer whales {{in the northeast}} Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a humpback whale researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, {{it may be that}} they also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct from residents and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are continuously rounded.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is {{a species}} of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from Virginia via the Gulf Coast of the United States south {{through most of the}} coastal New World tropics. This {{particular}} ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 5–6.5μm, broadly , smooth, and {{strongly}} amyloid (it turns black when treated with Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) {{are embedded in}} the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26–36 by 5–10μm, and have <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick. The flesh of the gills is homogeneous, and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a distinct , a well-differentiated hypoderm (a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle), and a filamentous tramal body (gill tissue); it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain.|$|E

25|$|Some 133 Ju 88s were {{pressed into}} the Blitzkrieg, but very high combat losses and {{accidents}} forced a quick withdrawal from action to re-train crews to fly this very high-performance aircraft. Some crews were reported to be more scared of the Ju 88 than the enemy, and requested a transfer to an He 111 unit. By this time, major performance deficiencies in the A-1 led to an all-out effort in a major design rework. The outcome was a longer, 20.08m (65ft in) wingspan, from extended rounded wing <b>tips</b> <b>that</b> had already been standardised on the A-4 version, that was deemed needed for all A-1s; thus the A-5 was born.
