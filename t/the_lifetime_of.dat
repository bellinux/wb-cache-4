5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool.

Efficient heat dissipation prolongs <b>the</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>of</b> those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks.
