5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been <b>thought.</b> <b>There</b> were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E

5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1745 Jacobite rising {{decimated}} the antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains. This liberalized the Scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land and keep the profits instead of giving all profits to the chieftains who owned all the land. Their literate foundation allowed the Scots to become economically literate {{and take advantage of}} trade. Edinburgh and Glasgow became epicenters of intellectual <b>thought.</b> <b>There</b> existed in Scotland a clergy who believed that a moral and religious foundation was required for, and compatible with, a free and open sophisticated culture, which moderated hardline conservatives. Herman presents biographies of Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), Robert Adam, Adam Smith, and others to illustrate the Scottish development.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Khan required five costumes, {{more than any}} other guest star in the entire series. This meant that the staff working on costumes had less time to devote to any one costume. Montalbán's athletic physique was such that when his measurements were passed to them, staff <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> had been a mistake. Costume designer William Ware Theiss found it challenging to produce the outfits in the time allotted, to make the materials seem suitably futuristic and to fit his own preferences in design. Two of Khan's outfits re-used previous costumes, while three were specifically created for Montalbán. The production built two new sets for the episode: the decompression chamber in sickbay, and the set on board Botany Bay. A doorframe from that set was later reused as an overhead unit in McCoy's research lab, which appeared later in the series.|$|E
