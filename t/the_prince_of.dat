5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} highly unlikely that the King would recover, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled {{over the}} terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most {{reasonable}} for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox suggested that it was <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.|$|E

5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|E

Two of Albert's cousins, King Pedro V and Prince Ferdinand of Portugal, died of typhoid fever. On top of this news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in gentlemen's clubs and the foreign press that <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales was still involved with Nellie Clifden. Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy. Although Albert was ill and at a low ebb, he travelled to Cambridge to see <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales on 25 November to discuss his son's indiscreet affair.

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{cartridge}} space, {{many ideas}} were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is killed by <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle.

Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon Quest II.
