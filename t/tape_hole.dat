40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} new measurements of electron current collection to porous tape probes in a high-speed flowing plasma, and a comparison to similar measurements with round cylinder, solid and slotted tape samples previously reported§. In these experiments, a Hall thruster was {{used to create a}} high-speed (~ 8 km/s) flowing unmagnetized plasma in a large 6 -m u 9 -m vacuum chamber. Experimental results of solid tape samples with widths spanning from 7. 2 to 20. 4 Debye lengths and slotted tapes with center-to-center line spacings spanning from 2. 1 to 6. 0 Debye lengths (gap widths from 1. 3 to 3. 6), were compared to measurements of <b>holed</b> <b>tapes</b> with <b>hole</b> diameters ranging from 1. 4 to 9. 4 Debye lengths. Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the results in the regime tested: 1) Beyond a threshold bias potential probably close to the beam energy, <b>holed</b> <b>tapes</b> collect more current when oriented transverse (perpendicular) to the flow, just like solid and slotted tapes; 2) Holed tapes are more efficient electron collectors than both solid and slotted tapes in terms of collected electron current per unit area when oriented perpendicular to plasma flow. However, when oriented parallel to plasma flow, slotted tapes are more efficient than holed or solid tapes; and 3) When the tapes were oriented parallel to the flow, the electron current collected on <b>holed</b> <b>tapes</b> decreases with increasing hole size until a minimum is attained, beyond which it start...|$|R

50|$|A {{carriage}} control tape was a loop of punched tape {{that was used}} to synchronize rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line printers from unit record days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A pin wheel moved the <b>tape</b> accurately using <b>holes</b> {{in the center of the}} <b>tape.</b> A <b>hole</b> punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form feed switch on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A machine {{capable of}} demonstrating and solving {{queueing}} problems {{is useful to}} any systems engineer. This paper describes a successful queueing simulator constructed from readily available materials. The machine is easy to operate, portable, and simple enough {{to be built in}} any well equipped machine shop. The educational values of a queueing simulator are unlimited. For this reason the paper was oriented towards classroom applications. Example problems present ample opportunity to compare theoretical and simulator solutions. Although constant, normal, and Poisson distributions are illustrated, any arrival or service pattern is acceptable. More realistic answers are obtained for many problems because arrival and service rates can be correlated to queue length. Single-server, multi-server, and multi-stage queues can be analyzed. This versatility aids conceptual realization required for system modifications. From the data available, simulator and theoretical solutions compare reasonably well. When making an industrial waiting line study a number of proposals must be investigated. By comparing them on the simulator the most economical one can usually be chosen. Thus, in addition to being an educational aid, the simulator is a practical problem solving device. Principles of operation are visually displayed by schematics of the electrical and mechanical systems. Queue length is determined by the number of one-quarter inch steel balls waiting for service from holes punched in a tape, The number and spacing of the <b>tape</b> <b>holes</b> represents the desired mathematical distribution. Tape speeds are controlled by varying the voltages applied to 12 volt motors. Total material cost amounted to 200, External power is supplied by 110 volt AC current.

50|$|Some {{influential}} figures {{had doubts}} about his proposed design for the decryption machine, and Flowers proceeded with the project while partly funding it himself. Like the later ENIAC of 1946, Colossus {{did not have a}} stored program, and was programmed through plugboards and jumper cables. It was faster, more reliable and more capable than the Robinsons, so speeding up the process of finding the Lorenz χ pin wheel settings. Since Colossus generated the putative keys electronically, it only had to read one tape. It did so with an optical reader which, at 5000 characters per second, was driven much faster than the Robinsons' and meant that the tape travelled at almost 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). This, and the clocking of the electronics from the optically read paper <b>tape</b> sprocket <b>holes,</b> completely eliminated the Robinsons' synchronisation problems. Bletchley Park management, which had been sceptical of Flowers's ability to make a workable device, immediately began pressuring him to construct another. After the end of the war, Colossus machines were dismantled on the orders of Winston Churchill, but GCHQ retained two of them.|$|R

5000|$|DCCs {{are similar}} to compact cassettes, except {{that there are no}} [...] "bulges" [...] where the tape-access holes are located. The top side of a DCC is flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on there (they are not {{required}} because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a bigger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette. A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the <b>tape</b> access <b>holes</b> and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog compact cassette, and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding marker on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and VHS tapes, this marker makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog compact cassettes, the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.|$|R
40|$|Microfluidic {{devices are}} {{diagnostic}} tools that are small, portable, and inexpensive. This makes them ideally suited for resource-limited settings.

It is necessary to have a paste to fill the <b>holes</b> in the <b>tape</b> and provide a medium for the fluid to wick through. The powder {{used to make the}} paste is very expensive and must be bought in bulk (an estimated $ 1121 - $ 1231), so it is not convenient for the Biomedical (BMED) department to use. This project was designed to develop nitrocellulose membrane paste to be used in microfluidic devices inexpensively. Nitrocellulose lacquer samples were made using a range of viscosities: 2, 5, 8, and 11 mL of acetone per gram of nitrocellulose membrane paper. Then a 3 D microfluidic device using the sample was created. An inexpensive method for creating paste to fill the <b>holes</b> in the <b>tape</b> layer was determined and proven successful ($ 170). It was found that the ratio of 11 mL of acetone per gram of nitrocellulose membrane paper created a paste that would allow for the fastest wick time in 3 D paper-based microfluidic device (15 min). Thus, this method is recommended to the BMED department for the development and testing of 3 D microfluidic devices...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cases that}} DCCs come in {{generally}} {{do not have the}} characteristic folding mechanism of those for analog compact cassettes. Instead, DCC cases tend to be simply plastic boxes that are open on one of the short sides. The front side has a hole that is almost the size of the cassette, so that any label on the cassette is exposed even when the cassette is in its case. This allows the user to slide the cassette {{into and out of the}} case with one hand, and it reduced production costs, especially for prerecorded cassettes, because a label is needed only for the cassette rather than for the case. Format partner Matsushita does, however, produce blank cassettes (under their Panasonic brand) with a clam-shell-style case. Because DCCs have no [...] "bulges" [...] near the <b>tape</b> access <b>holes,</b> there is more space in the case behind the cassette to insert, for example, a booklet for a prerecorded tape, or a folded up card on which users could write the contents of the tape. In spite of the differences, the outside measurements of the standard DCC cases are exactly identical to the cases of analog compact cassettes, so they can be used in existing storage systems. The Matsushita-designed clam-shell case is slightly thinner than an analog compact cassette case is.|$|R

To produce these cheques they use a number of different print systems, one of which comprises of a minicomputer, an industry standard tape deck and two printers, a Diablo daisywheel and a Control Data Corporation (CDC) printer which was extensively modified to cater for the requirements of the cheque printing industry. The CDC printer is used to print the code line on the cheques using magnetic ink. After each line is printed the computer sends a form feed command which causes the printer to throw paper. This throw is controlled by a paper tape, known as a Vertical Format Unit tape, or rather a VFU tape. This <b>tape</b> has <b>holes</b> punched into it at specific places which determine the amount of paper throw also known as vertical feed. The holes are sensed by brushes which are pulled up to 5 volt when they pass over a hole and touch a roller connected to the 5 volt line. This system, being of an electro-mechanical nature, is prone to faults and causes much down time due to mechanical wear on the brushes and dirt on the roller. This means that the brushes have to be adjusted and therefore also means that the timing has to be readjusted each time. The timing relationships are discussed in Section 2. ...|$|R

This manual presents drip irrigation as being suitable at a small-scale too (e. g., for watering vegetables during the dry season). Technically, all that is required is a bucket and irrigation tape.
