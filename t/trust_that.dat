Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained only a 6.5% stake {{of the sports}} franchises. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025. After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E

Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E

5|$|Ernst Lindemann was {{frustrated}} by the fact that—as commander of the Naval Gunnery School—he would never come into {{direct contact with the}} enemy. When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> had been bestowed on him but doubted that {{he would be able to}} get Bismarck ready for action before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding Bismarck, Lindemann had never held any shipboard command, a situation rare if not unique in the Kriegsmarine. Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany's leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.|$|E
5|$|Nauru is a {{phosphate}} rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, , are not economically viable for extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign {{state in the}} world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Hilary {{held the}} office of Sheriff of Sussex in 1155, and then again in 1160 through 1162. It was very unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff, and was {{a measure of the}} <b>trust</b> <b>that</b> King Henry II had in Hilary. Hilary was the only bishop to hold {{the office of}} sheriff during Henry's reign, with the {{possible}} exception of Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln. An English church council in 1143 had forbidden clergy to hold office as stewards or tax gatherers for non-clergy. As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county farm, or income from the county, and the payment of those revenues into the Exchequer, clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council. Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer, and was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome, and then sent back to the country of origin for trial. He also assisted other papal judges, including Theobald of Bec. Hilary served in England as a royal justice in 1156, and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157. Hilary acted as judge-delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric. He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions, and Hilary's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king.|$|E

5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a <b>trust,</b> <b>that</b> this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
5|$|The Warner {{brothers}} pooled {{their resources}} {{and moved into}} film production in 1910. Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison <b>Trust.</b> <b>That</b> same year, Jack Warner acquired {{a job as a}} film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante's Inferno. Despite the film's success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles. The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market. In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company. Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success, and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California. In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam. In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.|$|E
