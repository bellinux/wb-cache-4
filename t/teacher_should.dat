2500|$|There is some {{variation}} in scores {{from year to}} year and from class to class. [...] This variation is similar to performance measures in other fields, such as Major League Baseball and thus may reflect real, natural variations in the teacher's performance. [...] Because of this variation, scores are most accurate if they are derived from a large number of students (typically 50 or more). [...] As a result, it is difficult to use this model to evaluate first-year teachers, especially in elementary school, as they may have only taught 20 students. [...] A ranking based on a single classroom is likely to classify the teacher correctly about 65% of the time. [...] This number rises to 88% if ten years' data are available. [...] Additionally, because the confidence interval is wide, the method is most reliable when identifying teachers who are consistently in the top or bottom 10%, rather than trying to draw fine distinctions between teachers that produce more or less typical achievements, such as attempting to determine whether a <b>teacher</b> <b>should</b> be rated as being slightly above or slightly below the median.|$|E
2500|$|For Dewey and his {{philosophical}} followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners {{are taught}} {{that knowledge is}} transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. [...] Dewey not only re-imagined {{the way that the}} learning process should take place, but also the role that the <b>teacher</b> <b>should</b> play within that process. [...] For Dewey, “The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education” (Dewey, 1904, p.18). [...] Dewey’s qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. [...] Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which “work automatically, unconsciously” (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.|$|E

2500|$|Dewey {{not only}} re-imagined {{the way that}} the {{learning}} process should take place, but also the role that the <b>teacher</b> <b>should</b> play within that process. [...] Throughout the history of American schooling, education’s purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. [...] The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the K–12 public education system and to the teacher training schools who attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed {{to meet the needs of}} the employer and demands of the workforce. [...] In The School and Society (Dewey, 1976) and Democracy of Education (Dewey, 1980), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies. [...] Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1976; 1980).|$|E

The current cognitive theories of information processing, schema theory, and constructivism exhibit limitations and a lack of cohesion that make their implications for teachers unclear.

30|$|For policy implication, {{findings}} from this current study {{shed light on the}} importance of teachers to incorporate significant affective components into their classroom teaching or intervention programs in order to improve and enhance students’ understanding in mathematics.

Meanwhile, the Malaysian <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> enhance students’ instrumental motivation, their attitudes towards learning outcomes, self-efficacy, students’ perseverance; and Thai <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> enhance their students’ attitudes towards learning outcomes. The results further suggest that there is room for Indonesian and Thai teachers to foster student learning by promoting self-confidence and connectedness to school and peers in mathematics classroom.|$|R
