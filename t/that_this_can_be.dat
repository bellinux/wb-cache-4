The {{fact that it is}} homotopic is clear, since 3-space is contractible and thus all maps into it are homotopic, though the fact <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done through immersions requires some geometric argument.|$|E

25|$|Gene-set {{analysis}} (for example using tools like DAVID and GoSeq) {{has been}} shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. genome-wide bisulfite sequencing); it has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numberes of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.|$|E

25|$|The {{correlation}} between Doppler-detected intravascular bubbles and decompression sickness is {{that almost all}} divers who developed DCS after a dive produced large numbers of bubbles, but even grade 3 or 4 bubbles could manifest without signs or symptoms of DCS, and grades 0, 1 and 2 bubbles are associated with very low risk. In {{a series of tests}} by Sawatsky, Grade 3 bubbles were associated with a 5% risk and Grade 4 with about 10% risk. Bubbles may occur after exposures that have very good safety records. The utility of bubble detection is in assessing relative decompression stress. The value of bubble detection in non-symptomatic divers, is <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used as a safer threshold for assessing acceptable decompression stress than the incidence of clinical symptoms for evaluating decompression algorithms.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of strong reciprocity implies that systems developed based purely on material self-interest may be missing important motivators in the marketplace. This section gives {{two examples of}} possible implications. One area of application is {{in the design of}} incentive schemes. For example, standard contract theory has difficulty dealing with the degree of incompleteness in contracts and the lack of use of performance measures, even when they are cheap to implement. Strong reciprocity and models based on it suggest <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> explained by people's willingness to act fairly, even when it is against their material self-interest. Experimental results suggest that this is indeed the case, with participants preferring less complete contracts, and workers willing to contribute a fair amount beyond what would be in their own self-interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} section showed how self-efficacy {{can be related}} to a person's locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external locus of control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. In the {{previous section}}, the different types of locus of control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external locus of control, we can see <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external locus of control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.|$|E

25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find {{significant}} effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> because {{of the significance of}} wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E

Michael Nordine characterised Gatlif's directorial style as passive and [...] "documentarian", such that it [...] "sometimes verges on emotional distance". [...] "What easily noticeable flourishes he adds tend to be understated", he added. Eric Hynes at TimeOut lauded Gatlif's work in making a celebration of textures and music of the Romani out of a melodramatic story.
