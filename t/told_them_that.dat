5|$|Evans {{was killed}} by police on 5 January 1976, {{at his home in}} Los Angeles. Officers were called when his girlfriend phoned the police and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Evans was {{confused}} and had a gun. The police mistook the air rifle Evans was holding for a rifle and shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|Vulso {{remained}} in Asia Minor for another year. During {{that time he}} concluded the Treaty of Apamea with Antiochus and divided the lands of the Asia Minor coast between Pergamum and Rhodes. When the Galatian envoys came, Vulso <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> King Eumenes II of Pergamum would give them {{the terms of the}} peace when he arrived back from Rome.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not}} want to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E

6000|$|... "Acting--under--his--advice," [...] said Mr. Spriggs, sipping his tea, [...] "I {{wrote to}} Scotland Yard and <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> Augustus Price, ticket-of-leave man, {{was trying to}} obtain a hundred and ten pounds by false pretences." ...|$|R

But 'e never come." ...|$|R
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{she was going to}} {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not hear from her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{this would not be}} a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> frankly <b>that</b> {{these jobs}} were pretty well filled up.|$|R
60|$|We {{returned}} to the others and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> everything <b>that</b> we had learned from Shadrach.|$|R
60|$|They {{were still}} more {{astonished}} {{when he gave}} a paper to each one, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all <b>that</b> they were free.|$|R
5|$|Groves retired {{at the end}} of February 1948, and Nichols was {{designated}} as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now the Secretary of Defense, reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and Secretary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall to his office, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he expected the AFSWP and the AEC to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|Later on in 2012, Feeder took on {{one last}} tour for the year. The tour lasted for five dates {{starting}} at the O2 Academy Glasgow, before ending at the Brixton Academy in November. At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for a while, before deciding what to do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website Mancunian Matters in which he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the band would take a break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1944, the 258 {{men from}} the prison barge were marched to a nearby sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> troops {{fighting}} on Saipan desperately needed the ammunition {{they were supposed to}} be loading and that continued refusal to work would be treated as mutinous conduct, which carried the death penalty in times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the Battle of Tassafaronga, said that although loading ammunition was risky, death by firing squad was the greater hazard.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} he reached his capital the Sultan {{assembled}} his court and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all <b>that</b> had befallen him, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how he intended to adopt the young king as his heir.|$|R
60|$|Peter and Ginger was in 'igh spirits, and, though Sam <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> plain <b>that</b> {{he would}} sooner walk about {{with a couple}} of real pickpockets, they wouldn't leave 'im an inch.|$|R

5|$|Section 2 {{gives the}} third party various protections {{once they have}} chosen to enforce the act - the parties cannot alter or end the {{contract}} if the third party has <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he wishes to enforce the contract or relied on the contract (and the promisor knows this or {{could be expected to}} have known this). If the contract is breached, the third party has all the rights that he would have if he had been a party to the initial contract.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E
5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he was going into {{the hospital for a}} minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E
60|$|HARRIS. There's {{one other}} charge, Mr Mayor--poaching. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to keep <b>that</b> back till after.|$|R
60|$|When I {{went out}} into the front yard I found Mr. Poplington and Jone sitting on a little stone bench, for they was tired, and I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about <b>that</b> young woman and Davy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} lied {{to all of}} them," [...] she replied. [...] "I will have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all <b>that</b> I had plenty. I told her too. I could not be {{lowering}} James More to them." ...|$|R
5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La Pointe for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations could go to Washington {{and they had to}} turn back. The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York and then on to Albany and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|During the evening, {{elements}} of Morgan's army had advanced to within five miles (8km) of Corydon. The four Legion {{companies that had}} attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if they would promise {{to go home and}} not return to arms, he would allow them to leave and keep their guns. They all agreed and were released.|$|E
60|$|Then Sigwe <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of all {{the good}} fortune {{that had come to}} him through Suzanne, and of how wise had been the words of Sihamba, and <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> moreover, <b>that</b> if they dealt ill by either of them he would return from his own country and stamp them flat.|$|R
5000|$|Investigate {{magazine}} published, in February 2006, {{allegations that}} he entered the girls' dormitory to awaken students twice, and <b>that</b> he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> once <b>that</b> they were taking too long to shower after a [...] "mud run." [...] Benson-Pope denied any impropriety.|$|R
60|$|The boys found old Uncle Barney {{polishing}} his gun. He <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> however, <b>that</b> he was {{not going}} out hunting, but was going into the woods to inspect some of the trees with a view to cutting them down for lumber.|$|R
5|$|For {{reasons that}} USAF {{officers}} {{were unable to}} explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating {{for almost two years}} in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded negatively for technical reasons that the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{complaint}} {{alleged that the}} defendants made numerous false statements in attempting to collect payments from consumers, claiming that the computer owner or someone else consented to receiving the pop-up payment demands until they paid, the owner of any computer that received the pop-ups was legally obligated to pay Movieland, and that the computer owner was obligated to satisfy any contract that any other person entered into while using the computer. The only customer service telephone number provided was a 900 number. When consumers called it, a recorded greeting <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they would incur a $34.95 charge {{if they did not}} hang up within three seconds.|$|E
5|$|In late 1968, {{the members}} of the Jimi Hendrix Experience were living in a rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement, so he {{immediately}} phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to come over to the house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, nay. You {{must not}} turn from me too! She laid it all fairly before the lads in Brickwall garden between the yews. I <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> if Philip sent a fleet (and {{to make a}} {{plantation}} he could not well send less), their poor little cock-boats could not sink it. They answered that, with submission, the fight would be their own concern. She showed <b>'em</b> again <b>that</b> there could be only one end to it--quick death on the sea, or slow death in Philip's prisons. They asked no more than to embrace death for my sake. Many men have prayed to me for life. I've refused 'em, and slept none the worse after; but when my men, my tall, fantastical young men, beseech me on their knees for leave to die for me, it shakes me--ah, it shakes me to the marrow of my old bones.' Her chest sounded like a board as she hit it. 'She showed <b>'em</b> all. I <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> this {{was no time for}} open war with Spain. If by miracle inconceivable they prevailed against Philip's fleet, Philip would hold me accountable. For England's sake, to save war, I should e'en be forced (I <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> so) to give him up their young lives. If they failed, and again by some miracle escaped Philip's hand, and crept back to England with their bare lives, they must lie--oh, I <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> all--under my sovereign displeasure. She could not know them, see them, nor hear their names, nor stretch out a finger to save them from the gallows, if Philip chose to ask it.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 Barney {{played for}} the Great Falls Electrics. The September 5, 1913 Salt Lake Tribune reports that Barney [...] "started under a handicap. He was unknown, and {{there were those who}} {{predicted}} his early finish. The things that were said to him would have taken the heart out of any 19 year old lad. But Barney Duffy was different. He <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> {{he was going to go}} in and pitch ball and show <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> he was there. And her certainly has made good. Now there isn't a man in the Union association who doubts for a minute that Duffy will stick with the Pirates." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All I {{remember}} about my mother,' Nibs <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> 'is <b>that</b> she often said to father, [...] "Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own." [...] I don't {{know what a}} cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my mother one.' ...|$|R
