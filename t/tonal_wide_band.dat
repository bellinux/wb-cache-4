40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a method}} of {{handling}} and working with <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> noise is developed. We represent <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> noise as a distributed delay of white noise {{and use it to}} reduce a nonlinear system disturbed by <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> noise to a nonlinear system disturbed by white noise.

50|$|Analysis {{of golden}} tiger family trees shows that golden tigers are genetically normal orange {{coloured}} tigers {{with the addition}} of a recessive modifying gene, probably the <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> gene. This same <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> gene also gives rise to stripeless white tigers. A white tiger that inherits two copies of the recessive <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> gene will be a stripeless white. A normal orange tiger that inherits two copies of the recessive <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> gene will be a golden tabby. The <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> gene is carried independently of the white gene.|$|R

Narrow band model relations for absorptance {{are used to}} develop 'exact' formulations for total absorption by four <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> models. Application of a <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> model to a particular gas largely depends upon the spectroscopic characteristic of the absorbing-emitting molecule. Seven continuous correlations for the absorption of a <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> model are presented and {{each one of these}} is compared with the exact (numerical) solutions of the <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> models. Comparison of these results indicate the validity of a correlation for a particular radiative transfer application.

40|$|The ultra <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> antennas are {{required}} in applications where larger bandwidth for the transmitting signal is needed. They cover wide bandwidth {{in the range}} from 500 MHz to the frequencies above 8000 MHz. In this paper, a review of various techniques to realize ultra <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> microstrip antennas (MSA) is presented. They are realized by using different techniques like basic planar monopole antenna and the variations of the same by using different shapes of radiating monopole antenna, like, bi-conical, Bowtie, etc. They are also realized by using modifying the feeding strip shape or by cutting the slot inside the patch. The ultra <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> (UWB) response has also been realized by using fractal shapes in the radiating monopole antenna. Towards the end of paper, the scope of future work is proposed, wherein the exact formulation of resonant length is needed for planar monopole antenna at its fundamental and higher order modes as well as the explanation for the ultra <b>wide</b> <b>band</b> response in terms of operating modes in slot cut and fractal geometries.
