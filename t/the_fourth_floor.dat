40|$|The {{theme of}} this Bachelor´s thesis is a static {{assessment}} of the existing timber structure and the proposal of a new internal timber structure of the third <b>floors</b> and <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>floors</b> and <b>the</b> proposal of the roof structure. It is a reconstruction of the four-storey building of the former granary which will be reconstruct for the multipurpose building. The plan dimensions of the building are 29, 8 x 30 m. Building height is 12, 54 m. The load bearing structure of the third floors consists of cross beams, longitudinal girders and columns. The load bearing structure of <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>floors</b> and <b>the</b> roof consists of longitudinal girders, columns and purlins. The axial distance of columns is from 2, 55 m to 4, 0 m. The construstion is proposed to ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state. Static analysis has been accomplished by student version of the Scia Engineer 2015 software. For the timber structure is used solid timber of the strength class C 24. The construction is designed in accordance with valid standards for the designing of timber structures...|$|R

5|$|When the Shawnee Purchase Units {{were first}} established, {{temporary}} headquarters {{were set up}} in Room 303, First Trust and Savings Bank Building, Harrisburg, Illinois. This was the only modern office building {{in the town of}} Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor's offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>floor,</b> are leased by the Forest Service. Employees who were here during {{the early days of the}} forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the small space under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, 45% of the {{necessary}} repairs {{had been made to}} Altes Stadthaus by a few simple expedients such as emergency roofing. In the immediate post-war years, neither manpower, supplies, nor financing was available to undertake repairs on a larger scale. The reconstruction took place between 1950 and 1955 in five phases; the first focused on building up the courtyard wing on the Stralauer Straße side while the second phase, completed in early 1952, focused on the Stralauer Straße/Judenstraße wing and included construction of additional offices on <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>floor</b> and a 300-person dining hall with kitchen. However, {{for a number of reasons}} most significant of which was that the building was not the seat of government, the remaining three phases were not carried out. In addition, the reconstruction of Wilhelmine architecture was not a high priority, where as housing was and so funding for the restoration work was not included in the economic plan.|$|E
5|$|Kaja Bordevich Ballo (1988– March 28, 2008) was a {{university}} {{student in the}} French town of Nice; her father was Olav Gunnar Ballo, {{a member of the}} Norwegian Parliament. On March 28, 2008 Kaja Ballo took the personality test run by the Church of Scientology, and committed suicide later the same day. Family and friends stated that Ballo was happy prior to taking the test, and that her mood dramatically shifted after receiving the results. She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>floor</b> of her dorm room. In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology personality test among her belongings. French police investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.|$|E

Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him.

5|$|The {{original}} {{hospital building}} is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,600m2 was new, {{and the second}} provided a further 1,600m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>floor,</b> a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery.
