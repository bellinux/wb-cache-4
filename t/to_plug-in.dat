25|$|A 2016 study {{conducted}} by researchers from the University of California, Davis found that the federal tax credit was the reason behind more than 30% of the plug-in electric sales. The impact of the federal tax incentive is higher among owners of the Nissan Leaf, with up to 49% of sales attributable to the federal incentive. The study, based on a stated preference {{survey of more than}} 2,882 plug-in vehicle owners in 11 states, also found that the federal tax credit shifts buyers from internal combustion engine vehicles <b>to</b> <b>plug-in</b> vehicles and advances the purchase timing of new vehicles by a year or more.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2009, Volvo {{announced}} {{the launching of}} series production diesel-electric plug-in hybrids by 2012. The company plans to sell a series hybrid {{with the goal of}} achieving emissions of less than 50grams of CO2 per kilometer. As part of a joint venture with Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, Volvo converted two Volvo V70 <b>to</b> <b>plug-in</b> hybrid demonstrators that have been in field testing in Göteborg, Sweden since December 2009. Vattenfall offered customers participating in this trial the supply of renewable electricity generated from wind power or hydropower. Among other challenges, this test has allowed to experience the all-electric range at low temperatures, which has been a disadvantage of plug-in vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the launch}} of mass {{production}} plug-in hybrids, conversion kits and services were available in the United States to convert production model hybrid electric vehicles to plug-ins. The regular Toyota Prius has been commercially converted, using these aftermarket kits and tax incentives, to a plug-in hybrid by CalCars {{and a number of}} third-party companies. On a smaller scale, PHEVs have been sold as commercial passenger vans, utility trucks, general and school buses, motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles. Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technologies, Inc converts diesel buses <b>to</b> <b>plug-in</b> hybrids, under contract for the Chicago Transit Authority. Fisher Coachworks is developing a plug-in hybrid, the Fisher GTB-40, which is expected to get about twice the mileage of a regular hybrid electric bus.|$|E

500|$|For {{purposes}} of an accurate estimation of emissions, the analysis {{took into consideration}} the differences in operation between plug-in hybrids. Some, like the Chevrolet Volt, can operate in all-electric mode without using gasoline, and others operate in a blended mode like the Toyota Prius PHV, which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle, but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode. In addition, since the all-electric range of plug-in hybrids depends {{on the size of}} the battery pack, the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection of the share of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver, for both, electric only and blended EV modes. Since all-electric cars do not produce tailpipe emissions, the utility factor applies only <b>to</b> <b>plug-in</b> hybrids. The following table shows the overall fuel economy expressed in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) and the utility factor for the ten MY2014 plug-in hybrids available in the U.S. market, and EPA's best estimate of the [...] tailpipe emissions produced by these PHEVs.|$|E
500|$|One {{criticism}} to the UCS {{study is}} that the analysis was made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation {{at different times of}} the day. The former approach {{does not take into account}} the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day. An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The marginal analysis, applied <b>to</b> <b>plug-in</b> electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.|$|E

2500|$|Government {{incentives}} for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles {{have been established}} by several national and local governments {{around the world as}} a financial incentives <b>to</b> <b>plug-in</b> electric vehicle vehicles to consumers. These mainly include tax exemptions and tax credits, and additional perks that range from access to bus lines to waivers on fees (charging, parking, tolls, etc.). The amount of these incentives usually depend on battery size and the vehicle all-electric range, and some countries extend the benefits to fuel cell vehicles, and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.

An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009, and used the specifications for the Chevrolet Volt (all-electric range of [...] ). The analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the Upper Midwest compared to the Western U.S., and within regions, rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others. Applying the results of the marginal analysis <b>to</b> <b>plug-in</b> electric vehicles, the NBER researchers found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day.

This pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening.|$|E
