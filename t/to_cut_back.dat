5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that they would be able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> on overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms as a pretext to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the Methodist Church {{helped the}} merger of her school with the boys' Cookman Institute, forming the Bethune-Cookman College, a coeducational junior college. Bethune became president. Through the Great Depression, Bethune-Cookman School {{continued}} to operate, and met the educational standards of the State of Florida. From 1936 to 1942, Bethune had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> her time as president because of her duties in Washington, DC. Funding declined {{during this period of}} her absence. But, by 1941 the college had developed a four-year curriculum and achieved full college status. By 1942 Bethune gave up the presidency, as her health was being adversely affected by her many responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|In the 1985 NBA Finals, the Lakers made amends {{for their}} {{previous}} eight losses to the Celtics by defeating them in six games. Even though the Lakers lost {{the first game}} by 34 points in the Memorial Day Massacre, they won 4 of the next 5 games, including Game 6 at the Boston Garden, to finally end the long years of frustration of failing to defeat the Celtics. These finals {{were the first to}} be played in the 2–3–2 format, which was suggested by Boston coach Red Auerbach to NBA commissioner David Stern, as he hoped <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> on the frequent traveling from Boston to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{introduced}} and supported legislation to increase benefits {{and pay for}} federal workers, {{in part due to}} the Federal Government’s large presence within the 8th District – 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds. He introduced a bill signed into law that allows FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service. Moran also authored a law that allows a federal worker’s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity. In the 112th Congress, he also spoke against attempts by Republicans <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> the size of the federal workforce.|$|E
5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> on the gifts {{given to the}} Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of}} the relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E

5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> on its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E
5|$|Sardou's five-act play La Tosca {{contains}} {{a large amount}} of dialogue and exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera's plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed as though they were French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt's personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish the verses, needed not only <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> the play drastically, but to make the characters' motivations and actions suitable for Italian opera. Giacosa and Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that Puccini did not really want to complete the project.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to management on 8 October 2001 with Wrexham on a two-year contract, replacing Brian Flynn who had resigned after 12 years in charge, {{with the club}} 23rd in the Second Division. He was tasked with keeping the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> on the club's youth coaching spending, {{and as a result}} Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E

5|$|Tegetthoff was {{a central}} battery ship {{designed}} by Chief Engineer Josef von Romako. The ship's namesake, Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, victor of the Battle of Lissa, had proposed building four new ironclads. These were {{to be completed by}} 1878, but poor economic conditions in the early 1870s forced the Austro-Hungarian government <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> the naval budget. Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, who succeeded Tegetthoff as the head of naval administration, had attempted to secure funding for two new ships, to be named Tegetthoff and Erzherzog Karl from 1871. Pöck finally succeeded in convincing parliament to allocate funds for the first ship in 1875. He continued to try to convince the parliament to build a sister ship for Tegetthoff until 1880, without success. Austro-Hungarian industry was incapable of supporting the construction of the ship, and significant components had to be ordered from foreign manufacturers, including guns from Germany and armor plating from Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{the firm}} had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> operations, because {{news coverage of the}} Persian Gulf War drew viewers away from infomercials. Ron Perelman of Forbes Holdings Inc. bought a 37.5 percent share of Guthy-Renker in 1993 in exchange for $25 million and priority access to air-time on Perelman's television stations. At the time, Guthy-Renker had grown to $60 million in revenue. In 1996, Perelman's stake in the company was resold to News Corp and Guthy-Renker bought it back. Two years later, Goldman Sachs bought a stake in the company that valued Guthy-Renker at $3 billion, and a Japanese trading company, Nissho Iwai Group, bought a 17 percent portion of Guthy-Renker's Asia subsidiary for $9 million. Guthy-Renker created a television station for infomercials called GRTV in 1996, which was sold to TVN Entertainment Corporation in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. <b>To</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
