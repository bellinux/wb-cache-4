5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren {{and friend of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in {{what came to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> were an English {{punk rock}} band formed in London in 1975. Although they {{initially}} lasted just {{two and a}} half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> they have been called one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, having initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk and alternative rock musicians.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. <b>The</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> were all of these things.|$|E

50|$|In 1976, Steve Dior and Barry Jones {{built the}} basis of The Idols after {{previously}} rehearsing with Chrissie Hynde and Keith Levene and others in a band called The Quickspurts. The Idols evolved into what become The London Cowboys in the early 80s, where Steve was joined together with <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistol</b> Glen Matlock and singer Russell King.|$|R
5|$|In early September, Levene {{was fired}} from the Clash. Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling {{interest}} in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of speed, a charge Levene has denied. Levene and Lydon would form Public Image Ltd. in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as the Clash toured in support of <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> during December's Anarchy Tour.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> {{evolved from}} the Strand, a London band formed in 1972 by working-class {{teenagers}} Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played instruments they had stolen. They would go to concerts, and when these were over they would go up on stage and steal as much musical equipment as they could carry.|$|E
5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E
50|$|S.T.U.N's {{influences}} include <b>The</b> Clash, <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> Pixies, Noam Chomsky, Daniel Quinn, Jane's Addiction, Radiohead, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Super Furry Animals, and David Bowie.|$|R

5|$|Britain's Deviants, in {{the late}} 1960s, played {{in a range of}} {{psychedelic}} styles with a satiric, anarchic edge and a penchant for situationist-style spectacle presaging <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> by almost a decade. In 1970, the act evolved into the Pink Fairies, which carried on in a similar vein. With his Ziggy Stardust persona, David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central—elements, again, that were picked up by <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> and certain other punk acts. The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie's presentation concepts, while moving musically in the direction that would become identified with punk. Bands in London's pub rock scene stripped the music back to its basics, playing hard, R rock 'n' roll. By 1974, the scene's top act, Dr. Feelgood, was paving the way for others such as the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer that would {{play a role in the}} punk explosion. The pub rock scene created small venues where non-mainstream bands could play and they released low-cost recordings on independent record labels. Among the pub rock bands that formed that year was the 101ers, whose lead singer would soon adopt the name Joe Strummer, a performer who has been called the link between pub rock and punk rock. Despite the presence of some shared approaches and values between the two genres, they had an important difference; while pub rock aimed to continue the tradition of earlier rock'n'roll bands, punk rock aimed to break with tradition.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E
5|$|Lynott {{replaced}} Robertson with Gary Moore again, {{and around}} this time the band loosely joined forces with Steve Jones and Paul Cook of <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> and also with Chris Spedding and Jimmy Bain, to form The Greedy Bastards, who played {{a small number of}} gigs playing a varied selection of songs. In this way Lynott was able to align his band with the punk movement and avoid being tagged as a 'dinosaur' as many other 1970s rock bands had been. Other occasional members of The Greedy Bastards included Bob Geldof and Pete Briquette of the Boomtown Rats.|$|E

5|$|The Leicester Square Theatre {{is based}} in nearby Leicester Place. It was {{constructed}} in 1955 as a church, before becoming the Notre Dame Hall, then the Cavern in the Town, a popular live music venue in the 1960s. In the 1970s, it was renamed back to the Notre Dame Hall, where <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> played one of their first gigs at the club on 15 November 1976. It was converted into a theatre in 2002 as The Venue, and refurbished as the Leicester Square Theatre in 2008. In 2014, it began a production of a musical based on Oscar Wilde's De Profundis.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{influences}} include HEM, Beastie Boys, Black Sabbath, Bob Marley, Led Zeppelin, Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg, Cypress Hill, Notorious B.I.G. and Rage Against the Machine. Hed PE's second album, Broke, incorporated classic {{rock and}} world music influences, while Back 2 Base X {{was influenced by}} classic punk bands such as <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> and the Clash, Insomnia was influenced by thrash metal bands such as Slayer, and New World Orphans was influenced by Suicidal Tendencies and Minor Threat. Guitarist Jaxon has been credited for encouraging a heavier, hardcore punk-influenced musical style.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had {{performed}} publicly {{for the first}} time. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale {{was kicked out of}} the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> (or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> 2002 <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> box set {{includes}} another live {{version of}} [...] "Belsen Was a Gas" [...] on disc 3. This version was recorded on January 10, 1978 at the Longhorn Ballroom, Dallas, Texas.|$|R
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of punk rock in late 1976, the artistic focus of the band changed. Artists such as <b>the</b> Adverts, <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> <b>the</b> Buzzcocks and, particularly, the Ramones became major {{influences}} on the Undertones.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2000, {{the release}} of We Are Motörhead and the single from it, a cover of <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistol's</b> [...] "God Save the Queen", coincided with {{the start of the}} band's [...] "We Are Motörhead" [...] tour across South and North America during May and June, with a further nine shows across in Europe in July. Shows in the United States and France were {{followed}} by {{the release of}} a double-disc compilation album, The Best Of, on 26 August.|$|R
5|$|The loud {{volume of}} the band's live show {{influenced}} the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto punk and punk rock bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> the Clash and Green Day cite the Who as an influence. The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly the Jam, which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. The Who influenced hard rock bands such as Guns N' Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who. The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic! at the Disco.|$|E
5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. <b>The</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin release {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, {{a week and a half}} after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, a mockery of the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|E
50|$|During {{his younger}} years Håkansson {{regularly}} {{went through his}} father's record collection along with Andersson, and the two soon became fans of bands such as the mc5, <b>the</b> Ramones, <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> <b>the</b> Damned and the Rolling Stones.|$|R

5000|$|They toured {{extensively}} throughout 1977, first supporting The Stranglers {{and then}} as headliners in their own right. Their third release, the single [...] "Animal Games", was featured on <b>the</b> notorious <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> edition of <b>the</b> British TV rock show So It Goes.|$|R
5|$|London was {{instrumental}} in the development of punk music, with figures such as <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> The Clash, and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city. More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael's Wham!, Kate Bush, Seal, the Pet Shop Boys, Bananarama, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, McFly, The Prodigy, Gorillaz, Bloc Party, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, Ellie Goulding, One Direction and Florence and the Machine. London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of hip hop and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The 100 Club, in the {{basement}} of No.100, has been running as a live music venue since 24 October 1942. It was thought to be safe from bombing threats due to its underground location, and played host to jazz musicians, including Glenn Miller. It was renamed the London Jazz Club in 1948, and subsequently the Humphrey Lyttelton Club after Lyttelton took over the lease in the 1950s. Louis Armstrong played at the venue during this time. It became a key venue for the trad jazz revival, hosting gigs by Chris Barber and Acker Bilk. It was renamed the 100 Club in 1964 after Roger Horton bought a stake in the venue, adding an alcohol licence for the first time. The venue hosted gigs by several British blues bands, including the Who, the Kinks and the Animals. It was an important venue for punk rock in the UK and hosted the first British punk festival on 21 September 1976, featuring <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> the Damned and the Buzzcocks.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by <b>the</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols.</b> In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E
5000|$|One {{illustration}} of French's, entitled 'Longhorns - Dance', achieved worldwide notoriety {{when it was}} appropriated by <b>the</b> late <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> manager and fashion designer Malcolm McLaren in 1975 {{as the basis for}} artwork for a T-shirt sold through <b>Sex,</b> <b>the</b> King's Road boutique McLaren operated with Vivienne Westwood.|$|R
5000|$|Brown's {{interest}} in music {{was inspired by}} the punk movement, specifically <b>the</b> bands <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols,</b> <b>the</b> Clash and Manchester band Slaughter & the Dogs. Brown and original Stone Roses bassist Pete Garner attended the recording of the Clash single [...] "Bankrobber" [...] in Manchester.|$|R
50|$|Alex formed The Nils when he {{was only}} 13. He would listen to punk rock records such as <b>The</b> Clash, <b>Sex</b> <b>Pistols</b> and Stiff Little Fingers. He bought himself an $80 guitar and taught himself three chords. By 1978 The Nils had formed and began playing live.|$|R
