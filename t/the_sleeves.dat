5|$|In this game, the Crimson Tide wore Nike Pro Combat uniforms for {{the first}} time. These uniforms {{featured}} crimson jerseys with grey and white houndstooth numbers, a houndstooth stripe on the helmet, houndstooth gloves and an American flag sewn into one of <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> in honor of Veterans Day. The houndstooth design was chosen {{as a tribute to}} former Alabama coach Bear Bryant who was known for wearing a houndstooth fedora during games. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 73–18–3 (75–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

The home kit comprised red and navy blue halved shirts with red collars, navy blue shorts and navy blue socks with two white strips on the cuffs. The away kit included white shirts with black shoulders, white shorts and white socks with black cuffs. Last season's third kit was retained, which featured light blue shirts with a maroon collar, bar a section under the neck which was light blue, and maroon trims on <b>the</b> <b>sleeves,</b> maroon shorts and light blue socks.

30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{is being}} driven, <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{transfers}} <b>the</b> periodic vibrating load to the soils around <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> (Ekanayake et al. 2013). The strain in the soils around <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> continues to increase, and the cohesion and shear strength gradually decrease. Compared to the infinite soils outside <b>the</b> <b>sleeve,</b> <b>the</b> soil plug inside <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> undergoes stronger cyclic shear force transferred from <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> wall. Therefore, <b>the</b> fluctuation {{of the internal}} shaft resistance is more obvious {{than that of the}} external shaft resistance. As the result, the soil strength and cohesion decrease under cyclic shearing action. Because of the decrease in the soil strength and cohesion, the soil plug becomes partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance of sleeve is much smaller than those by other installation methods.|$|R

During the 2014–15 season, Partick Thistle supported the Breast Cancer Care Charity by {{wearing a black}} and pink away shirt, with the charity ribbon on the shirt. The partnership saw a portion of kit sale revenue being donated to Breast Cancer Care. Partick Thistle's current home kit features a yellow and red shirt, <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> are yellow with a predominanty red foreground. The kit features black shorts, red socks, with a yellow trim. The away kit is white, with a yellow collar and sleeve trim on the jersey. Goalkeepers wear a generic kit design from Joma, and are either pink or grey.|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to <b>the</b> <b>sleeves,</b> allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

5|$|F.C. United's club colours are red, {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red shirt with {{a black and white}} stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a white shirt with a horizontal red and black wave, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a red and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a white shirt with a red trim, black shorts and white socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> of musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed the moat and also started to come inside Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} <b>the</b> proposed grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector with and without steel spiral as transverse reinforcement under incremental tensile load until failure. The connector utilized mild steel pipe as <b>sleeve</b> where <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> consists of external and internal <b>sleeve</b> with <b>the</b> diameter of <b>the</b> external <b>sleeve</b> is larger than internal <b>sleeve.</b> <b>The</b> mild steel pipe and the steel spiral are used to confine and reinforce the grout and the two discontinued bars spliced end-to-end configuration in <b>the</b> <b>sleeve.</b> <b>The</b> test shows that, there are two modes of failure which were bar slipped and bar fractured outside <b>the</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Eleven specimens out of fourteen shows satisfactory results as it failed due to bar fractured outside <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> and achieve satisfactory ultimate tensile capacity. The stiffness and the ductility of the connectors also satisfy. Grouted sleeve connectors with steel spiral perform better compared to connectors without a steel spiral. The test shows that the performance of <b>the</b> grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector with or without steel spiral was governed by grout-bar bond, anchorage length and confinement action provided by <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> and <b>the</b> steel spiral.

30|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} with decreasing the modification factor the axial velocity is decreased, so {{the time to}} pinch is increased. <b>The</b> optimum insulator <b>sleeve</b> length corresponds to the conditions for uniform discharge development and its take off across <b>the</b> insulator <b>sleeve</b> surface. When <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> is too long the increased inductance may cause the current sheath to remain at <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> surface for longer period of time. When <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> is too short, the rapid current sheath development may cause spoke formation. As a result, when <b>the</b> insulating <b>sleeve</b> is not of appropriate length, the current sheath no longer remains uniform, and the so-called filaments or spokes are developed [26].|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{also shows}} the stress arch is most obvious {{within a certain}} range from <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> end. Within <b>the</b> range, the soil plug {{undertakes}} the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance, and the stress value increases with the penetration depth. The simulation results accord with the study of Lobo-Guerrero and Vallejo (2007), the contact stress mainly was concentrated at <b>the</b> bottom of <b>sleeve</b> end, and was delivered to the interior of <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> in a short distance from <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> end. During <b>sleeve</b> jacking, <b>the</b> void ratio is slightly smaller than the void ratio in initial stress state due to the monotonic shear between <b>the</b> soils and <b>sleeve</b> wall. Compared to <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> jacking, <b>the</b> arching effect of vibratory sleeve driving is relatively weaker, since the cyclic shear between <b>the</b> soils and <b>sleeve</b> wall makes void ratio decrease to the minimum value (Henke and Grabe 2008). The soil plug is compacted under vibratory action, which makes the soils at <b>the</b> bottom of <b>sleeve</b> difficult to be squeezed into <b>the</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> arching effect is relatively weaker.|$|R
