5|$|The {{major change}} in {{agriculture}} in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E
5|$|This system {{developed}} as a tropical depression just offshore {{the west coast of}} Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought 1,200deaths and extensive damage, including the destruction of approximately 85%–95% of banana crops, the severe damage dealt to 70%–80% of <b>tree</b> <b>crops,</b> and the roughly 40% of the sugar cane crops ruined. Martinique, Montserrat, and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities, but the impacts at those locations were not nearly as severe as in Guadeloupe.|$|E

40|$|Estimates of {{the area}} of swidden fallow {{secondary}} forest in Indonesia are inaccurate, partly because swidden agricultural practices giving rise to the secondary forest are heterogeneous.

25|$|Some {{argue that}} almost all of the above is based on an unhistorical {{projection}} of present concerns, onto the past. This alternative view argues that there are immense complexities of time, space, climate, geology and topography which, when combined with our extremely fragmentary information, makes generalizations almost impossible. <b>Tree</b> <b>crops,</b> dates, figs, olives, chestnuts etc, played a very important role in Roman agriculture. Grains were often intercultivated with these <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> Almost all species of trees grow again when cut down. Cutting down a wood does not, by itself, destroy woodland. Coppicing is one way in which wood could be harvested on a sustainable basis for example. Hypocausts were pre-adapted to burn poor quality fuels like straw as well as coal. There is good reason to believe that both straw and coal were important fuels in antiquity, especially in Roman Britain where coal was abundant in many areas. A great deal of protection against soil erosion arises from terracing hillsides. We do not know how extensive terraces were in antiquity but {{a good deal of the}} soil erosion, here assumed to be caused by the Romans, may well date to the dark ages when the maintenance of terraces broke down. Changes in tree cover may well arise from differences in climate, which are still not well understood. But there is some evidence that the decline of the Roman West is linked to climate change.|$|E

25|$|Direct reuse projects. According to one estimate, 1,500 ha were {{irrigated}} with reclaimed {{water in}} the vicinity of treatment plants as of 2009 in 15 locations, of which the biggest are near As-Samra (510 ha), Aqaba (208 ha), Ramtha (121 ha) and Wadi Musa (107 ha). Crops irrigated are forage crops and <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> One of the first pilot projects for direct reuse was implemented in Wadi Musa with support from USAID. Water was first used to irrigate a demonstration farm, and then the fields of nearby farmers. Another pilot project was initiated using wastewater from the small Wadi Hassan treatment plant to irrigate green spaces {{on the campus of the}} University of Irbid, and commercial fruit plantations. In most cases of direct reuse, the Water Authority of Jordan, the operator of most municipal wastewater treatment plants in Jordan, has concluded contracts with farmers. The total area irrigated under contracts with WAJ is 760 ha, or about half the total irrigated area. It is thus about 12 times smaller than the area irrigated with indirectly reclaimed water from the As-Samra plant in the Jordan Valley.|$|E

Guadeloupe received a direct hit from the storm, apparently with little warning; the death toll there was 1,200, and damage reports relayed through Paris indicated [...] "great destruction" [...] on the island.

40|$|Swidden {{agriculture}} in tropical Asia is a diverse practice, {{making it difficult}} to draw general conclusions on trends of the development of swidden fallow secondary forests (SFSF). There is, however, sufficient evidence to recognise trends of a gradual intensification often through the incorporation of extensive <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> production in SFSF, or a direct conversion to intensive <b>tree</b> cash <b>cropping.</b> Factors contributing to the changes include emerging markets for cash crops or timber and pulp wood production, government policies and development projects, fire, and population pressures. In Indonesia and mainland Southeast Asia, there is evidence of change towards <b>tree</b> and cash <b>crop</b> based production systems. In northeastern India, there is improved fallow management to sustain or enhance productivity of the shortened swidden agricultural cycle to support a subsistence economy. In Sri Lanka, biophysical factors inhibit the development of intensive agroforestry systems. Although swidden fallow land use has often been stigmatised as leading to forest decline and a related decline in the environmental functions that forests provide, there is sufficient evidence suggesting that conversion of a SFSF dominated landscape to more intensive <b>tree</b> <b>cropping</b> can have a negative environmental impact. Some general options for the evolution of swidden agriculture under different stages of a land use intensification model are considered...|$|R
