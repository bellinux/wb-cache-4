Kurt and his new gay friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) later <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about being gay and closeted, but he denies that the kiss happened and soon resumes his bullying. He even threatens to kill Kurt if he tells anyone else about the kiss. Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) finds out about the threat, but not the kiss, and Karofsky is soon expelled, but is allowed to return by the school board because no physical violence to Kurt had been witnessed; Kurt transfers to Dalton Academy {{to get away from}} him.|$|E

When the bully, Dave Karofsky, throws Kurt against a locker, Kurt confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, Kurt shoves him away. Kurt and Blaine <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Karofsky about being gay and closeted, but he denies the kiss.

2500|$|The {{present perfect}} has an {{iterative}} sense {{unique to the}} Galician-Portuguese language group. It denotes an action or a series of actions {{that began in the}} past and are expected to keep repeating in the future. For instance, the sentence Tenho tentado falar com ela would be translated to [...] "I have been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her", not [...] "I have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her". On the other hand, the correct translation of the question [...] "Have you heard the latest news?" [...] is not *Tem ouvido a última notícia?, but Ouviu a última notícia?, since no repetition is implied.|$|R

On each she cried over her lessons, and was cross at whatever the boys said to her, made a fuss about keeping the ornamental cases of the bon-bons, and went about round-backed, peevish, and discontented, finding everything flat and ugly after her one peep at the luxuries of the Park. Her farthings melted away fast; but she seemed to think this her misfortune, not her fault. She did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Miss Fosbrook, feeling perhaps that she was in a naughty mood, which she would not try to shake off; and she made no attempt to go on with her present for her Mamma, it looked so poor and trumpery after the beautiful things she had seen.|$|E
