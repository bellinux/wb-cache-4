5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to <b>trapped</b> <b>air.</b> It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
25|$|Preload {{pressure}} {{is essential to}} ensure good contact. Insufficient pressure results in areas of non-contact with <b>trapped</b> <b>air,</b> and results in higher-than-expected interface thermal resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} adapter {{problem was}} caused by its honeycomb structure. As the rocket accelerated through the atmosphere, the cells expanded due to <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> and water. This would cause the adapter surface to break free. To stop this occurring again, small holes were drilled in the surface to allow for expansion.|$|E

25|$|An ice core is a {{core sample}} from the {{accumulation}} of snow and ice that has re-crystallized and <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> bubbles over many years. The composition of these ice cores, especially the presence of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, provides {{a picture of the}} climate at the time. Ice cores contain an abundance of climate information.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} glaciers, snow repeatedly freezes and thaws, changing into granular ice called firn. Under {{the pressure}} of the layers of ice and snow above it, this granular ice fuses into denser and denser firn. Over a period of years, layers of firn undergo further compaction and become glacial ice. Glacier ice is slightly less dense than ice formed from frozen water because it contains tiny <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Liquindi {{is water}} drumming, {{typically}} practiced by Pygmy women and girls. The sound {{is produced by}} persons standing in water, and hitting {{the surface of the}} water with their hands, such as to trap air in the hands and produce a percussive effect that arises by sudden change in air pressure of the <b>trapped</b> <b>air.</b> The sound cannot exist entirely in water, since it requires the air-water boundary as a surface to be struck, so the sound is not hydraulophonic.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} gas cell formation in man-made thermal insulation, glass and polymer materials {{can be used}} to <b>trap</b> <b>air</b> in a foam-like structure. This principle is used industrially in building and piping insulation such as (glass wool), cellulose, rock wool, polystyrene foam (styrofoam), urethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, and cork. <b>Trapping</b> <b>air</b> is also the principle in all highly insulating clothing materials such as wool, down feathers and fleece.|$|R

25|$|The {{essential}} components {{include a}} shell of watertight material, sufficiently flexible to allow the wearer to function adequately, seals where {{parts of the body}} pass through the suit while in use, and a method of sealing the access opening while the suit is worn. Insulation may be provided in part by the suit shell, but is usually largely provided by thermal insulation clothing worn under the suit, which relies to a large extent on <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> for its insulating properties. An inflation valve with gas supply and dump valve are generally provided, but were not standard on early models.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 the Spearfisherman Company, {{owned by}} Arthur Brown, of Huntington Beach, California was {{approached}} by the US Navy to produce a rubber suit. These were advertised in {{the first issue of}} the Skin Diver magazine in December 1951, as “seamless, one-piece, pure gum rubber, nude freedom frogman suits”. These were entered by a chute which was folded and clamped to seal, and were available as full length or shortie suits with integral hood. Later versions had a neck level entry chute and a nape valve to purge <b>trapped</b> <b>air.</b> The shortie version was also rebranded as Kellys 7-seas suit.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} used for windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, water skiing and other surface water sports where the user is {{frequently}} immersed in cold water. These suits are often made from very lightweight material for high flexibility. Membrane type suits are commonly used {{in the spring and}} autumn with moderate water temperatures, but Neoprene and hybrid dry suits for surface sports are preferred in cold water. These provide greater thermal protection {{in the event of a}} leak. The ability to swim for self-rescue in these types of suits is important to water sports users that do not use a boat. A neoprene bottom also is less likely to allow <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> to collect in the legs, causing the wearer to tend to float head down in the water.|$|E
5000|$|Fibres may be texturised {{to improve}} the fibre's {{insulation}} properties (as processes like bulking allow it to <b>trap</b> <b>air</b> better), to minimise a shiny, synthetic-looking appearance, to reduce the silky nature of the fibre, or to create special effects (fancy yarns).|$|R
50|$|A {{sea otter}} has {{two types of}} fur, the underfur and the guard hair. The shape of these {{different}} hair fibers connect to <b>trap</b> <b>air</b> between them. This allows them to maintain their body heat without the blubber other sea mammals use.|$|R
50|$|Because run-off {{areas and}} their {{associated}} safety devices (i.e. gravel <b>traps,</b> <b>air</b> fences, tire walls, etc.) are a primary safety feature of tracks, they hold enormous economic sway over the track, a consideration {{that is not}} lost on designers of new tracks and existing tracks' renovation projects.|$|R
25|$|Seismology: To better {{prepare for}} calamities, Zhang Heng invented a {{seismometer}} in 132 CE which provided instant alert to {{authorities in the}} capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific cardinal or ordinal direction. Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400km (248mi) to 500km (310mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern Gansu). Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and {{the movements of the}} Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of <b>trapped</b> <b>air.</b> See Zhang's seismometer for further details.|$|E
25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any <b>trapped</b> <b>air.</b> It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
25|$|The wreck {{is rapidly}} {{disintegrating}} due to natural rusting. The dive boats {{that rely on}} the wreck for their livelihood are also tearing the wreck apart by mooring the boats to weak parts of the wreck, leading to parts of the wreck collapsing. For this reason, in December 2007 the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA) a non-governmental organisation installed 32 permanent mooring buoys and drilled holes in the wreck to allow <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> to escape. During this work, the vessel was closed off to recreational diving. However, as of 2009, none of these moorings remain as the blocks themselves were too light (resulting in ships dragging them), and the lines connecting the moorings to the wreck were too long (meaning with the strong currents in the area, people would find it impossible to transfer from the mooring to the actual wreck). As a result, all boats now moor off directly to the wreck again.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the test performance and longitudinal evolution of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> for diagnosing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over 7 years, 111 combined inspiratory and expiratory computed tomographic examinations were performed in eight healthy control subjects and 38 heart-lung transplant recipients. Functional impairment was assessed with the BOS classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) {{analysis was performed}} to {{determine the}} optimal threshold of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> to distinguish between patients with and those without BOS and to compute sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing BOS. RESULTS: The extent of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> increased with BOS severity (P =. 001). A threshold of 32 % of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> is optimal for distinguishing between patients with and those without BOS and provides a sensitivity of 83 %, a specificity of 89 %, and an accuracy of 88 %. The prevalence of BOS and positive predictive value of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> increased with postoperative time, but the negative predictive value of <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> remained high throughout the study. Patients without BOS who had <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> exceeding 32 % of the parenchyma were at significantly increased risk of developing BOS (P =. 004). CONCLUSION: At the threshold of 32 %, <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> is sensitive, specific, and accurate for diagnosing BOS. Patients with <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> below 32 % are unlikely to have BOS. <b>Air</b> <b>trapping</b> exceeding 32 % may be an early indicator of future BOS.

500|$|In one experiment, Lavoisier {{observed}} {{that there was}} no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container. He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. [...] "lifeless"), which did not support either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the earlier name in French and several other European languages.|$|E

500|$|Diffusion {{within the}} firn layer causes other changes {{that can be}} measured.
