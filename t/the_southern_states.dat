5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>states</b> would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, the Kentucky General Assembly elected Breckinridge to a U.S. Senate {{term that}} would begin in 1861. In the 1860 presidential contest, he {{captured}} the electoral votes {{of most of}} <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>states,</b> but finished a distant second among four candidates. Lincoln's election as President prompted the secession of <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>states</b> to form the Confederate States of America. Though Breckinridge sympathized with the Southern cause, in the Senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully. After the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the Civil War, he opposed allocating resources for Lincoln to fight the Confederacy. Fearing arrest after Kentucky sided with the Union, he fled to the Confederacy, joined the Confederate States Army, and was subsequently expelled from the Senate. He served in the Confederate Army from October 1861 to February 1865, when Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Confederate States Secretary of War. Concluding that the Confederate cause was hopeless, he encouraged Davis to negotiate a national surrender. Davis's capture in April, 1865 ended the war, and Breckinridge fled to Cuba, then Great Britain, and finally Canada, remaining in exile until President Andrew Johnson's offer of amnesty in 1868. Returning to Kentucky, he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875.|$|E

But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.|$|E

5|$|On November 6, 1860, Lincoln {{was elected}} the 16th {{president}} of the United States, beating Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party.
