5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Caprivi began {{ordering}} new protected cruisers, he also authorized the construction of smaller unprotected cruisers for use in Germany's overseas colonies. The first of these, the , were laid down in 1886 and 1887. A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger and faster <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> followed over the next five years. A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented another attempt to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which provided the basis for all future German light cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
50|$|Although the QuietComfort 2 Headphones {{were hit}} with less {{criticism}} <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor,</b> audiophiles and headphone aficionados feel {{that even with}} the improvements, the QC2 {{has not yet been}} brought up to par.|$|R
50|$|On September 9, 2014, Apple {{revealed}} the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus {{at an event}} in Cupertino. Both devices had a larger screen <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor,</b> at 4.7 and 5.5 inches respectively.|$|R
50|$|The T2s {{were more}} durable <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor,</b> the T1, and so also more long-lived. The last T2s were {{superseded}} in the 1980s, although some vehicles remain in museums. Some T1 vehicles were converted into T3 during the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains {{as to whether they}} cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E
5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were designed to accommodate much smaller garrisons <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, {{the implication is that}} the resident units were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fort just one-seventh the size of a typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in a fort only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence must be treated with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in question may be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit in two or three different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b> The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, fossil {{fragments}} {{from three}} additional specimens were discovered by Zhao Xijin, Cheng Zhengwu, Xu Xing, and Peter J. Makovicky. However, these specimens were less complete <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor,</b> {{and so the}} original specimen was made the holotype when describing the taxon.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925 and 1926, {{fourteen}} Class GD Garratts entered branchline service. Marginally {{larger and}} more powerful <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor</b> Class GC and with a higher axle loading, they were built by BP. They were superheated and had plate frames, Belpaire fireboxes and Walschaerts valve gear.|$|R

25|$|The Baron Haussmann's transformations to Paris {{improved}} {{the quality of}} life in the capital. Disease epidemics (save tuberculosis) ceased, traffic circulation improved and new buildings were better-built and more functional <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{generation}} was active mostly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Tom Vague describes them as more vicious <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> {{and says that}} they perhaps didn't have as much cause as the earlier generations to rebel.|$|E
2500|$|Simon Cox, Asia {{economics}} {{editor for}} The Economist, predicted that while China might face future economic challenges, the incoming leaders {{expected to take}} over the top positions in late 2012 ( [...] Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang [...] ) were far less likely <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor</b> to respond with Keynesian policies.|$|R
500|$|New Order's debut single, 1981's [...] "Ceremony", {{was formed}} {{from the last}} two songs written with Curtis.

50|$|The Renown-class ships had {{an overall}} length of 794 ft, {{a beam of}} 90 ft, and a draught of 30 ft at deep load. They {{displaced}} 27320 LT at standard load and 32220 LT at deep load. While 90 ft longer <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor,</b> , they displaced 2780 LT less than the older ship at deep load.|$|R
25|$|Greswell's next {{appearance}} in important cricket was for Ceylon, {{again in a}} one-day match with an England side {{on its way to}} Australia. The 1924–25 team's stopover in Colombo was no more comfortable <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> in 1920 had been: a virtually full Test side was dismissed for a total of 73, and Greswell took eight wickets for 38 runs.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{total of}} {{fourteen}} pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the Fifth Dynasty. The quality of construction of the Abu Sir pyramids is inferior {{to those of the}} Fourth Dynasty – perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> and are built of low-quality local limestone.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} also purchased new DE (Diesel Electric) 30 and DE-DM (Diesel Electric and Dual Mode) 30 {{diesel engines}} {{capable of providing}} push-pull service with the bilevels. In October 2002, a total of 836 Bombardier-built M7 cars began to replace the entire M1 fleet. By the end of 2006, the M7s completely replaced the aging M1 fleet. The M7s were able to deal better with snowstorms <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b>|$|E

50|$|From 1867 a {{total of}} 152 {{examples}} of this engine were built in Bavaria for the Ostbahn. The five series differed in their dimensions from one another. They had larger grate and heating areas <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor</b> engines, the Class C II. In addition the drive was to the middle axle, so that shorter connecting rods could be used. The locomotives had an Allan valve gear and injectors.|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{barriers}} {{that come from}} being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less knowledge of the English language compared to U.S. natives, second-generation immigrants are doing better than U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants doing so well is the drive to succeed and do better <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization.|$|E
25|$|Gradually {{over the}} next 3,500 years, Leto not only survives, but also is {{transformed}} into a hybrid of human and giant sandworm. By the time of God Emperor of Dune, he has exterminated all other sandworms, and his own transformation has modified his component sandtrout. When Leto allows himself to be assassinated, the sandtrout release themselves to begin the sandworm lifecycle anew; subsequent offspring are tougher and more adaptable <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> allowing them to ultimately be more easily settled on other worlds, thus ensuring the survival of the sandworm species. Each one, according to Leto, carries in it a tiny pearl of his consciousness, trapped forever in an unending prescient dream.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{students}} at UC Berkeley are {{generally considered to}} be less politically active <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> and far more liberal than the surrounding city of Berkeley. In a poll conducted in 2005, 51% of Berkeley freshmen considered themselves liberal, 37% considered themselves moderate, and 12% identified as conservative. 43.8% have no religious preference compared to a national average of 17.6%. In 1982, 20.8% identified as conservative, 32.9% identified as liberals, and 46.4% identified as moderate. Although Republicans are in the minority, the Berkeley College Republicans is the largest political organization on campus. Democrats outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of nine to one, leading to some conservative student criticism of the faculty for teaching with a liberal bias.|$|E
50|$|The post-Constitutional Movement era of Persia {{brought about}} a new {{atmosphere}} for the artist. The Constitutionalists were cultured and appreciated art more <b>than</b> did <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> thus respect for Kamal-ol-Molk and his works increased.|$|R

50|$|This {{technology}} {{marks the}} first collaborative product of the ongoing Callaway and Lamborghini alliance to combine research and development efforts towards their mutual goal of power-to-weight ratio and weight reduction. The effect of the improvement is that the Callaway Diablo Octane drivers average about 8 yd greater distance per drive <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessor</b> Diablo Edge drivers and the Sesto Elemento, with its Forged Composite chassis, is one-third lighter than the Lamborghini Superleggera and goes from zero to 60 mph almost a full second faster.|$|R
25|$|After Texas seceded {{from the}} United States in 1861, many county offices, {{including}} that of constable, remained unfilled or were filled by men less competent <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b> During the military occupation of Texas after the Civil War, the election of county officials all but ceased, as the Union military appointed more than 200 individuals to state and county offices. A number of these appointees refused to serve; from 1865 to 1869, over one-third of the county offices in Texas were vacant. Many counties had no appointed or elected constables during this period. Austin, DeWitt, Fayette, McLennan, and Navarro counties had but a single constable each, appointed by Gen. Edward R. S. Canby, head of the Fifth Military District, in 1868-69.|$|E
25|$|Holbein evidently {{retained}} favour {{under the}} new order. The reformist council paid him a retaining fee of 50 florins and commissioned him to resume work on the Council Chamber frescoes. They now chose themes from the Old Testament instead of the previous stories from classical history and allegory. Holbein's frescoes of Rehoboam and of the meeting between Saul and Samuel were more simply designed <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b> Holbein worked for traditional clients at the same time. His old patron Jakob Meyer paid him to add figures and details to the family altarpiece he had painted in 1526. Holbein's last commission in this period was the decoration of two clock faces on the city gate in 1531. The reduced levels of patronage in Basel may have prompted his decision to return to England early in 1532.|$|E
25|$|Minority {{populations have}} {{increased}} exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources, structural and community factors {{as well as}} residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress. The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods. These food deserts affect a family’s ability to {{have easy access to}} nutritious food for their children. This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that have a variety of vending machines and deliver over processed foods. These environmental condition have social ramifications and in the first time in US history is it projected that the current generation will live shorter lives <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> will.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Gravettian people are not clear, they seem to appear {{simultaneously}} all over Europe. To a greater extent <b>than</b> <b>their</b> Aurignacian <b>predecessors,</b> they {{are known for their}} Venus figurines.|$|R
