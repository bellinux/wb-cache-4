30|$|The local-minimum problem {{occurs when}} a {{destination}} node is near <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monitoring area.

5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region.

5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting {{to make peace with}} the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, it is conceivable that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E

40|$|A {{geometric}} automorphism is an automorphism of a geometric graph that preserves crossings and noncrossings of edges.

Second, if <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convex hull contains {{at least four}} vertices, then it is invariant under every geometric automorphism.
