40|$|The blended {{wing-body}} configuration holds a major {{structural design}} challenge at the centre-body where the structure must support both wing bending loads and internal cabin pressure. A membrane approach is proposed which decouples the loads {{to allow their}} resistance by two independent structures: an inner membrane for cabin pressure and an outer structure to resist wing loads. A columned multi-bubble fuselage is proposed for the inner membrane structure, which are multispherical configuration to efficiently withstand the pressure loads. Considering this configuration, the carry-through structure can be designed and optimised. Finite element results show a significant reduction of stress level in this design over that for a conventional multi-bubble fuselage. Up to 30 % weight reduction is achieved for a military cargo application that requires an extensive area with no structural interruption. For the outer carry-through structure, the <b>topology</b> and shape <b>optimisations</b> of finite element models were performed on the given design domain.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} design of multi-hop regular virtual topologies to {{facilitate}} optical packet switching in networks with arbitrary physical topologies. The inputs to the virtual topology design problem are the physical topology, the traffic matrix and the regular topology. In this paper, this problem is tackled directly and also by decomposition into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem, dilation minimisation, uses only the physical topology and the virtual <b>topology</b> as <b>optimisation</b> inputs. The second sub-problem considers the traffic matrix and virtual <b>topology</b> as <b>optimisation</b> inputs. The solutions of these two sub-problems are compared {{with each other and}} against the results obtained when the global problem is optimised (using all three possible input parameters) for a variety of traffic scenarios. This gives insight into the key question of whether the physical topology or the traffic matrix is the more important parameter when designing a regular virtual topology for optical packet switching. Regardless of the approach taken the problem is intractable and hence heuristics must be used to find (near) optimal solutions in reasonable time. Five different optimisation heuristics, using different artificial intelligence techniques, are employed in this paper. The results obtained by the heuristics for the three alternative design approaches are compared under a variety of traffic scenarios. An important conclusion of this paper is that the traffic matrix plays a less significant role than is conventionally assumed, and only a marginal penalty is incurred by disregarding it in several of the traffic cases considered. 1...|$|R

30|$|Distribution network topological {{structure}} plays a {{vital role}} in improving the reliability and efficiency of power system (Narimani et al. 2014). Distribution feeders are connected in a radial structure that is maintained by appropriately altering the status of the switches installed on the distribution networks. There are two types of switches, that is, sectionalizing switches and tie switches. The sectionalizing switches are normally closed switches on connecting the line sections and the tie switches are normally open switches on the tie-lines connecting either two primary feeders. By changing the status of some switches, loads can be transferred from one feeder to an adjacent one to generate a reconfigured network topology. Thus, the switching combinations determine the reconfigured network structures in a distribution system. There are many possible candidate topologies in a distribution network because of the large number of candidate switching combinations. It is a complicated combinatorial optimisation problem to obtain an optimal topology from these candidate <b>topologies.</b> This <b>optimisation</b> aims at finding a radial structure that satisfies operating constraints. The artificial intelligence algorithms have widely used to address the optimisation problem recently (Tang et al. 2014; Rao et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2014; Tolabi et al. 2011; Gupta et al. 2014; Alonso et al. 2015; Golshannavaz et al. 2014). An encoding scheme, as the base of the intelligence optimisation approaches, is to represent the candidate configurations by a series of decimal codes.|$|R

The paper discusses potentials solutions which will help to improve efficiency of electrostatic precipitation of sub-micron particles as these particles attracted attention due to environmental and health risks which they pose.

Richardson, ???Control Methodologies for Relative Motion Reproduction in a Robotic Hybrid Test Simulation of Aerial Refuelling???, paper {{presented}} at the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) Conference, Hyatt Regency, Minneapolis, USA, 13 - 16 August, 2012. In many applications it is advantageous to simulate the relative motion of two bodies in a laboratory environment. This permits the testing of sensors and systems critical to the safety of equipment and personnel with reduced risk, and facilitates stage-gate management of large projects to mitigate financial risks. The University of Bristol is collaborating with Cobham Mission Equipment to develop a large-scale facility for relative motion simulation, primarily for the purpose of testing automated air-to-air refuelling systems. The facility incorporates two 6 DOF articulated robotic arms whose motion is dictated by real-time numerical simulations of the physical environment. Sensors on the robot-mounted equipment feed back into the numerical simulation to perform closed loop simulations with real hardware. This paper discusses the development of the facility and the different approaches considered for achieving real-time control of the robotic hardware. It then goes on to focus on aspects of the control <b>topologies</b> and motion <b>optimisation</b> which are used to maximise the performance of the facility.

40|$|Topological {{analysis}} of the Internet is needed for developments on network planning, optimal routing algorithms, failure detection measures, and understanding business models. Accurate measurement, inference and modelling techniques are fundamental to Internet topology research. A requirement towards achieving such goals is the measurements of network topologies {{at different levels of}} granularity. In this work, I start by studying techniques for inferring, modelling, and generating Internet topologies at both the router and administrative levels. I also compare the mathematical models that are used to characterise various topologies and the generation tools based on them. Many topological models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous System(AS) topologies. I use an extensive set of measures and innovative methodologies to compare AS topology generation models with several observed AS topologies. This analysis shows that the existing AS topology generation models fail to capture important characteristics, such as the complexity of the local interconnection structure between ASes. Furthermore, I use routing data from multiple vantage points to show that using additional measurement points significantly affect our observations about local structural properties, such as clustering and node centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably affected by additional measurements locations. The shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an underestimation of the complexity of the connectivity in the Internet and biases of measurement techniques. An increasing number of synthetic topology generators are available, each claiming to produce representative Internet topologies. Every generator has its own parameters, allowing the user to generate topologies with different characteristics. However, there exist no clear guidelines on tuning the value of these parameters in order to obtain a topology with specific characteristics. I propose a method which allows optimal parameters of a model to be estimated for a given target <b>topology.</b> The <b>optimisation</b> is performed using the weighted spectral distribution metric, which simultaneously takes into account many the properties of a graph. In order to understand the dynamics of the Internet, I study the evolution of the AS topology over a period of seven years. To understand the structural changes in the topology, I use the weighted spectral distribution as this metric reveals differences in the hierarchical structure of two graphs. The results indicate that the Internet is changing from a strongly customer-provider oriented, disassortative network, to a soft-hierarchical, peering-oriented, assortative network. This change is indicative of evolving business relationships amongst organisations. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Direct drive Permanent Magnet Linear Generators (PMLGs) {{are used}} in energy {{converters}} for energy harvesting from marine waves. Greater reliability and simplicity can be achieved for Wave Energy Converters (WECs), by using direct drive machines linked to the power take-off device, in comparison with WECs using rotational generators combined with hydraulic or mechanical interfaces to convert linear to rotational torque. However, owing to the relatively low velocities of marine waves {{and the desire for}} significant energy harvesting by each individual unit, direct drive PMLGs share large permanent magnet volumes and hence, high magnetic forces. Such forces can generate vibrations and reduce the lifetime of the bearings significantly, which is leading to an increase in maintenance costs of WECs. Additionally, a power electronics converter is required to integrate the generator‘s electrical output to meet the requirements for connection to the national grid. This thesis is concerned mainly with the fundamental investigation into the use PMLGs for direct drive WECs. Attention is focused on developing several new designs based on tubular long stator windings <b>topologies</b> and <b>optimisation</b> for flat PMLGs. The designs are simulated as air- and iron-cored machines by means of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Furthermore, a new power electronics control system is proposed to convert the electrical output of the long stator generators. Various wave energy-harvesting technologies have been reviewed and it has been found that permanent magnet linear machines demonstrate great potential for integration in WECs. The main reason is the strong exaltation flux provided by the high number of permanent magnets. Such flux, combined with design simplicity, can deliver high induced voltage as well as structural integrity. In the thesis, a flat single and double structured iron-cored PMLG is studied and optimised. Several magnetic force mitigation techniques are investigated and an optimisation is conducted. The optimisation is concerned mainly with increasing electrical output power and reducing the magnetic forces in the generators. As a result, an optimal design introducing the idea of separated magnetic cores has been proposed. The FEA simulations reveal that magnetic separation in the yoke can increase significantly the energy-harvesting capability of PMLGs. Furthermore, the concept of the design of long stator windings for tubular PMLGs is studied. Two long stator generators having different magnetisation topologies and similar sizes to existing machine are modelled and compared to the existing machine. The similar-sized existing and proposed PMLGs are simulated by FEA. In this way, settings such as different boundary conditions, symmetry boundaries and material properties are used to gain confidence in the simulated results of the proposed machines. Moreover, the simulated results for the existing PMLG are verified against previously performed numerical simulations and practical tests delivered and published as part of other research. The outcome for the proposed PMLGs reveals several advantages for the long stator design, such as lower cogging forces and higher energy harvesting and a lower price of the raw structural materials. Additionally, the thesis proposes and simulates a new design for an air-cored PMLG. To boost the output power, the proposed design is based on a long stator topology adopting two sets of permanent magnet rings sandwiching copper windings in a tubular structure. The design is compared with a current machine in FEA and the results show significant reduction in radial forces and an increase in energy harvesting. Finally, a novel power electronics control system, bypassing inactive coils is suggested and simulated as part of the grid integration system for the long stator PMLGs. The new system achieves a reduction in the thermal losses in the power electronics switches in comparison with existing systems. The power electronics system and the generator have been simulated in Matlab coupled externally with FEA (JMAG Designer). PRIMaRE/University of Exete...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue to {{the strict}} discussions {{regarding}} energy saving {{and the goal}} to reduce CO 2 emissions to 95 g CO 2 /km, specified for the year 2020 (BUMD, 2009), {{there is a strong}} demand for lighter and lightweight design automotive structures to support the energy saving targets. In view of a holistic approach, and to prospectively meet the requirements of the automotive sector, economic and production-orientated aspects, as well as joining technologies within the scope of multi-material design must also be considered to achieve a great leap towards medium to large-scale production. To accomplish these goals, a comprehensive method for urban vehicle concepts with electric powertrain and their necessary vehicle structures is presented. The dimensions and packaging of the presented vehicle are based on demands of a future urban vehicle with a four-passenger capacity that includes baggage, steerable front system wheels and a rear axle with an electric powertrain. At the beginning of the method, the relevant user requirements, e. g. space for occupants and baggage and range for the urban vehicle, are defined. In addition, input variables are discharged through state-of-the-art electric vehicles. In this step, {{it is important to consider}} additional requirements, such as crash requirements or requirements for electrical components in the vehicle design. With the defined requirements, the package of the urban car has to be defined. Two paths are determined to a geometrically and a simulative way. The simulative consideration is limited to the vehicle longitudinal dynamics; thus, a rough dimensioning of the drive components is derived. The outputs of the simulation are the performance measures, which are converted into components for the overall model to dimension, for example, the electric motor or battery. The geometric design phase begins with the positioning of the occupants in the passenger compartment and the ergonomic layout. Based on this conception of the complete vehicle, various FEM <b>optimisations</b> (<b>topology,</b> topography, size) are carried out for the body in white, in order to construct structures for individual (functional) components/modules. This top-down approach gives the opportunity to obtain constructive innovations, which must be integrated within this early concept phase, also to reduce costs when aiming to develop a series product. With this holistic approach, a load-specific optimised structural design is generated virtually and evaluated, and an outlook on dynamic loads (crash behaviour) is also given. The focus here is on the potential for innovations by the definition of novel package alignments in combination with the useful application of multi-material-design methods, resulting in a light modular vehicle structure...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop and evaluate an automated design description and optimisation framework based on the Shape Grammar (SG) syntax. In particular, an algorithmic methodology to automate the SG syntax using evolutionary intelligence is proposed. The proposed automation of SG is achieved by mapping the genetic information provided by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to context-free grammar rules by a means of Backus-Naur Form (BNF) syntax known as Grammatical Evolution (GE). GE is an efficient optimisation tool, which {{can be used in a}} variety of optimisation problems. First, its use in single and multi-objective optimisation of mathematical functions is demonstrated. Several techniques for synthesis of variables using specific BNF syntaxes are proposed. The results obtained from numerical experiments are compared with those obtained using a standard GA. Interestingly, the results show a notable improvement in the convergence speed over the standard GA for the functions tested. This observation surpassed expectations, since the GE is based on the GA. The use of GE is then extended to automate the SG syntax by deriving a grammar based design shape description and optimisation framework. To evaluate its efficacy and to demonstrate the concept, this framework is applied to two distinctive classes of problems frequently encountered in engineering practice. The first class of problems is related to shape descriptions and optimisation aspects of structural design. A specific BNF syntax is developed for planar shapes which makes use of four SG rules with arc primitives of variable size given by a radius and an angle of rotation. These SG rules are then used in the synthesis of piecewise parametric curves for the shape description and optimisation of a planar crane hook. The experimental results show superiority in convergence speed when compared to shape optimisation of the same problem based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) combined with a GA search strategy. The second class of problems considered here relates to the <b>topology</b> description and <b>optimisation</b> of planar trusses. Several BNF syntaxes are developed to achieve simultaneous topology, size and configuration optimisation. The experimental results thus obtained show good agreement with the results reported in the literature using an alternative truss optimisation method based on GA. Furthermore, by using the proposed truss description and optimisation method the computational expense is significantly reduced. The proposed design description and optimisation framework based on the SG syntax is a fast and efficient design exploration tool. The successful application of this proposed framework combining SG with design exploration in a range of structural problems validates the proposed idea...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{and timely}} {{performance}} data are of vital importance for network administration. However, modern networks are {{so large and}} transmit such enormous quantities of data that collecting the complete measurements can be wildly impractical. Network tomography uses the measurements {{that are available to}} infer underlying performance statistics. In this thesis we consider estimating average packet loss rates on links from more easily collected path measurements. Most such work has concentrated on tree-networks, but here we consider the problem on a general network where the problem is typically underconstrained. In that context we need some criteria to select a solution from the infinite set of possibilities. Here we exploit the compressive sensing assumption of sparsity. However, although the assumption of sparsity makes a great deal of sense in this context, the standard conditions required for results in compressive sensing theorems do not hold for realistic routing matrices. We show that despite this, the underlying techniques can still provide useful answers. What's more, we show that the apparently inconvenient structure of routing matrices can actually help in solving the problem efficiently. We provide CTD, a new algorithm for finding sparsest solutions that is orders of magnitude faster than one of the standard compressive sensing algorithms, and which provides more certainty. We also provide a version of CTD for working with a limited number of measurements, CTDn. The success of a tomography algorithm often depends upon the underlying network topology. To test CTD we use two sources of topologies: the Internet Topology Zoo and synthetically generated topologies. We propose a new method for <b>topology</b> synthesis, Combined <b>Optimisation</b> and Layered Design (COLD), that mirrors the real-life design process of a data network. Since real data networks are designed, they are in some sense optimized to fulfil a function. However, strict mathematical optimisation is rarely performed at the router lever; rather the PoP-level is typically the one being optimized, because it is both more stable and less intricate. Once the PoP-level network is determined, the router-level network can be created using a templated design process, increasing regularity and aiding management and debugging. COLD mirrors this process by having two layers: PoP-level optimisation of realistic economic constraints subject to demand; and then router level synthesis with a templated design process using graph products. We show COLD produces sensible, varied yet controllable output with a clear relationship to the relatively few input parameters. We test CTD and CTDn with both Topology Zoo topologies and COLD-generated topologies. Because the COLD process can be controlled to generate a wide variety of topologies this allowed us to test the sensitivity of CTD and CTDn to the form of the underlying topology. We show that CTD and CTDn perform well across a wide variety of topological structures and forms of measurement, while relying on less detailed information than previous approaches. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the aerodynamic design of airfoils for a Multi-Mission Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MM-UAV). Novel shape design processes using evolutionary algorithms (EA) and a surrogate-based management system are developed to address the identified issues and challenges of solution feasibility and computational efficiency associated with present methods. Feasibility refers to the optimality of the converged solution {{as a function of}} the defined objectives and constraints. Computational efficiency is a measure of the number of design iterations needed to achieve convergence to the theoretical optimum. Airfoil design problems are characterised by a multi-modal solution <b>topology.</b> Present gradient-based <b>optimisation</b> methods do not converge to an optimal profile, hence solution feasibility is compromised. Population-based optimisation methods including the Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been used in the literature to address this issue. The GA can achieve solution feasibility, yet it is computationally time-intensive, hence efficiency is compromised. Novel EAs are developed to address the identified shortcomings of present methods. A variant to the original Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm (PSO) is presented. Novel mutation operators are implemented which facilitate the transition of the search particles toward a global solution. The methodology addresses the limited search performance of the original PSO algorithm for multi-modal problems, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency for aerodynamic design applications. Demonstration of the developed principles confirmed the merits of the proposed design approach. Airfoil optimisation for a low-speed flight profile achieved drag performance improvement that is lower than a off-the-shelf shape designed for the intent role. Acceptable computational efficiency is achieved by restricting the optimisation phase to promising solution regions through the development of a novel, design variable search space mapping structure. The merit of the optimisation framework is further confirmed by transonic airfoil design for high-speed missions. The wave drag of the established optima is lower than the identified, off-the-shelf benchmark. Concurrently significant computational time-savings are achieved relative to the design methodologies present in the literature. A novel surrogate-assisted optimisation framework by the definition of an Artificial Neural Network with a pattern recognition model is developed to further improve the computational efficiency. This has the potential of enhancing the aerodynamic shape design process. The measure of computational efficiency is critical in the development of an optimisation algorithm. Airfoil design simulations presented required 80 % fewer design iterations to achieve convergence than the GA. Computational time-savings spanning days was achieved by the innovative algorithms developed relative to the GA. Hence, computational efficiency of the developed processes is confirmed. Aircraft shape design simulations involve three-dimensional configurations which require excessive computational effort due to the use of high-fidelity solvers for flow analysis in the optimisation process. It is anticipated that the confirmed computational efficiency performance of the design structure presented on two-dimensional cases will be transferable to three-dimensional shape design problems. It is further expected that the novel principles will be applicable for analysis within a multidisciplinary design structure for the development of a MM-UAV...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} the density-based <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> approach for the design of heat sinks and micropumps based on natural convection effects. The problems are modelled under the assumptions of steady-state laminar flow using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled to the convection-diffusion equation through the Boussinesq approximation. In order to facilitate <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation,</b> the Brinkman approach is taken to penalise velocities inside the solid domain and the effective thermal conductivity is interpolated in order to accommodate differences in thermal conductivity of the solid and fluid phases. The governing equations are discretised using stabilised finite elements and <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> is performed for two different problems using discrete adjoint sensitivity analysis. The study shows that <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> is a viable approach for designing heat sink geometries cooled by natural convection and micropumps powered by natural convection.

40|$|The present paper {{introduces}} {{a new technique}} for simultaneously optimising the topology and continuous material distribution of a structure. <b>Topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> offers great potential for novel, improved structural designs and is an ideal design tool for additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. Level set based <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> produces solutions with clear, smooth boundaries that can be directly fabricated using AM. Further benefits of AM may be realised by also optimising the material distribution within the structure. The sequential linear programming level set method is used to include material distribution design variables in the <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> problem. This allows the topology and continuous material distribution to be optimised simultaneously. Several compliance minimisation problems are used to demonstrate the proposed approach...|$|E
30|$|Geometric {{optimisation}} of ducted {{flows in}} cars, like airducts for cabin climatisation, engine air intakes or exhaust systems, are commonly subject to severe packaging constraints. This {{gave rise to}} the development and adoption of <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> methods for automotive applications. After a concise retrospective of these development efforts, it will be shown that especially for ducted flows, <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> is a perfect complement to the classical shape optimisation.|$|E
40|$|Two {{strategies}} are presented that generate an optimised structural design by <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation,</b> which is {{applied in the}} first strategy to specific areas in a given spatial design {{and in the second}} strategy to the complete spatial design. Two other strategies apply evolutionary principles to generate optimised sets of one spatial design and one accompanying structural design via either a co-evolutionary method or a genetic algorithm. All four {{strategies are}} compared using academic spatial designs, and the co-evolutionary strategy is compared with a case study as well. The efficacy of <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> depends on the load type; <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation</b> generates complete 3 D building structural designs; and modifying the spatial design may be as effective as <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation.</b> Compared to the co-evolutionary method, the genetic algorithm finds more design alternatives, but converges slowly, however outcomes of both methods are similar. The case study shows that the co-evolutionary strategy provides useful design alternatives, yet is not capable of addressing the level of detail found in practice. Guidelines for the practical and academic applications of the strategies are given...|$|E

40|$|To find {{structure}} concepts {{for building}} spatial designs, structural elements {{can be added}} to a spatial design, preferably at the boundaries of the explicitly defined spaces, and these elements can subsequently be optimised via <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation,</b> which is here defined as strategy I. Another strategy (II) is to interpret the total volume of the spatial design as structural mass -so without defined spaces-, and to optimise the distribution of this mass via 3 D <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation,</b> most often naturally yielding (open) spaces as well. In this paper, strategy II is extended by including a movable void explicitly. The final aim is to compare strategies I and II, however, some issues exist with movable voids within gradient-based <b>topology</b> <b>optimisation,</b> and future research needs to explore non-gradient based methods first...|$|E
