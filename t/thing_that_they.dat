5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics, {{according}} to Brown are about relationships, {{and to be}} there for each other. That it does not matter to say merely that you love them, the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> care is that their lover give his promise that he will be there for them whenever they need him. In [...] "Say You'll Be There", the group exuded a brash confidence that was attractive to their teenage and young adult fans. The Spice Girls decide to be friends, not lovers, the clear message is that the relationship can be channelled and controlled by the girl, with an emphasis on stating where they come from and what they stand for.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} Gather Together is {{inspired}} by Matthew 18:19-20: [...] "Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I {{in the midst of}} them" [...] (King James version). While Angelou acknowledged the title's biblical origin, she also stated that the title counteracted the tendency of many adults to lie to their children about their pasts. Scholar Sondra O'Neale states that the title is [...] "a New Testament injunction for the traveling soul to pray and commune while waiting patiently for deliverance".|$|E

500|$|Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, {{producers}} at Universal Pictures, independently {{heard about}} Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. Brown came across {{it in the}} literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave {{a detailed description of}} the plot, concluding with the comment [...] "might make a good movie". The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was [...] "the most exciting <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had ever read" [...] and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.|$|E
500|$|At the 1956 Winter Olympics, Hickey, a [...] "rink rat" [...] who was {{overlooked}} for {{ice hockey}} {{when he was}} young because of his small frame, came seventh in the 500 and 1000metres speed skating at his second Olympics. He later won a bronze medal at the world championships. Australia's nine other competitors were less successful; two male figure skaters—Allan Ganter and Charles Keeble—placed in the top 15 but in the bottom 25% in the individual event, while the pairs combination of Mervyn Bower and Jacqueline Mason failed to take to the ice after Bower was injured. The five downhill skiers were Australia's least successful entrants; the highest finish was 33rd and the median was 60th, and all were near the bottom of their events. Australia sent its first coach and female staffer for the 1956 campaign; C. Mason oversaw the skaters and Lillian Chisholm acted as the chaperone. The ice hockey team offered to pay their own way to compete; the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed from the AOF was formal permission. However, the AOF never responded to their request; they were unable to attend, and criticised the AOF for their disinterest. One of the affected athletes was Geoff Henke, later credited for ending the neglect of winter sports when he became an administrator.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of several items, including a soft-drink glass, {{a bottle of}} milk, marshmallows, and pages from a briefcase, falling onto the ground. A QR code, which was said to produce the word [...] "LOVE" [...] when scanned, can be seen printed on the glass and bottle, {{and on the ground}} during the scene of the marshmallows falling. In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the falling objects convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general idea here is that something exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the exciting <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up from the inside of a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible {{standing in the middle of}} a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E

2500|$|Caro {{continues}} {{in his analysis}} that Robert Kennedy tried to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate; he met with staffers such as Larry O'Brien, his national campaign manager, to say that Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought [...] "it was a stroke of genius". When John and Robert Kennedy next saw their father Joe Kennedy, {{he told them that}} signing Johnson as running mate was the smartest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had ever done.|$|E
2500|$|A {{symbolic}} language {{and way of}} communicating emerges, in which inanimate [...] "things" [...] are personified. A market (or a price, or a stock, or a state etc.) gains an independent power to act. Marx calls this commodity fetishism (or more generally, [...] "fetishism"), and he regards it as a necessary reification of the symbolizations required to traverse life's situations in bourgeois society, because the relationships between people are constantly being mediated by the relationships between things. It means that people are eventually unable to take their mask off, because the masks are controlled by the business relationships between things being traded, and by broader legal, class, or political interests. If they are actually unable to take the mask off, they have effectively submitted fully {{to the power of}} abstract, impersonal market forces and legal rules. As many philosophical texts suggest, by being habituated to a role, the role is internalized by individuals, and becomes part of their personality: they become the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> acted out.|$|E

2500|$|The Guggenheim Helsinki Design Competition in 2014–2015 was the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation's first open, {{international}} architectural competition. It received 1,715 submissions from 77 countries, {{a record}} for a museum design competition. The design chosen for a proposed €130 million Guggenheim museum in Helsinki, Finland, envisions [...] "an indistinct jumble of pavilions faced in charred wood" [...] and glass. The winning design is by Paris-based Moreau Kusunoki Architectes. Critics objected to the dark color of the design's exterior, which contrasts with the surrounding architecture, {{as well as the}} shape of the building. Osku Pajamaki, vice chairman of the city’s executive board, said: [...] "The symbol of the lighthouse is arrogant {{in the middle of the}} historical center ... a Guggenheim museum next to Notre Dame in Paris. People are approaching from the sea, and the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will see is that the citizens of Helsinki bought their identity from the Guggenheim." [...] The proposed museum was rejected by the Helsinki city council in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interview}} that Wilbur Chamberlin of the New York Sun conducted with Ament elevated the indulgences issue into a cause célèbre. Chamberlin had first met Ament in Beijing on 14 October 1900. In {{a letter to}} his wife, Chamberlin indicated: The Rev. A. is a missionary, and he appears {{to be a very good}} sort of a fellow, but I cannot for the life of me approve of his methods....You see, when the soldiers came to Peking and these missionaries were safe, some of them began at once to clamor for damages that they said they had sustained. The first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did was to get for living places the palaces of the rich Chinese Princes, and when they had them they started in clearing them out. They took everything of value and sold it for a song. Then they let their native Christians go out hunting and stealing more loot, and then they sold that. They said it was no sin and eased their consciences by saying they had the right to reimburse themselves for the losses they sustained. It was just as if a man had stolen something from me, and, to get square, I went and stole something from him. In other words, two wrongs make a right. That may be all right, but I don't think so. At A.'s home, which was the palace of Prince Pei, a Manchu, before the trouble, I met a lot more missionaries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Maus' {{first two}} {{official}} albums Songs (2006) and Love Is Real (2007) generally drew negative reviews upon release, a cult following gradually formed. In the late 2000s, {{he was awarded}} a scholarship to study political philosophy at the University of Hawaii, where he had a day job as a professor. In the evenings, he continued working on music from his office. By 2009, Maus relocated from Hawaii to a secluded cabin in Minnesota, where he struggled to write material for a third album. He said that he eventually gave up, and instead began [...] "doing lots of chemistry projects and chromatography experiments. I set myself on fire a few times heating inflammable solvents." [...] Meanwhile, he continued his studies at the European Graduate School in Saas Fee, Switzerland and earned his master's degree. He did not live in Switzerland, [...] "but would go {{out there in the}} summers. It's like that Black Mountain <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did over here years ago, where they bring out all of the heavy hitters and you can study with them yourself." [...] One of his professors was the French philosopher Alain Badiou, who would originate the title of his third album We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves (2011). After the positive response to Pitiless Censors, Maus grew more widely accepted as an outsider artist, and there was a critical reevaluation of his earlier work. In 2012, the album was followed with the compilation A Collection of Rarities and Previously Unreleased Material. Spanning recordings from 1999 to 2010, the collection selects outtakes from his previous three albums in addition to tracks which had appeared on other compilations. [...] He envisioned that after he completed his PhD dissertation, he would return to teaching, stating in 2011 that he could not foresee a career in music.|$|E

30|$|Two constructs, teacher immediacy {{and student}} {{learning}} perceptions, must be defined and contextualized within {{teaching and learning}} experiences {{in order to understand}} the context of computer-mediated learning. The construct of immediacy was first introduced by Mehrabian (1966, 1971) in interpersonal communication studies. Immediacy behaviors are those that improve psychological and physical closeness with others. A key underlying premise is that people tend to gravitate towards other individuals or <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> prefer or find desirable.
