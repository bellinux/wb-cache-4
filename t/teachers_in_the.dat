5|$|The {{strategies}} of gay activists {{were once again}} split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy {{and the rights of}} <b>teachers.</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Advocate, Goodstein urged gays not to live up to stereotypes and let the professionals try to win. However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective.

However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cincinnati Public Schools, {{founded the}} Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, {{where they were}} struck by how the {{discipline}} they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's {{school system}} was {{expanding}} rapidly, creating {{a shortage of}} qualified <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported teacher education program at Transylvania University. The state's superintendent, John D. Matthews, lobbied for the bill, claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children's minds. The bill passed in 1856, and Transylvania University made {{the transition from a}} private institution to a state-supported university. Money raised through school taxes, previously regarded as revenue by the legislature, was diverted to support of Transylvania. Although the teacher education program enrolled seventy-five students, opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage. Many citizens felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.|$|E
