40|$|The “Shoe Box” Approach Efficient wing {{structures}} {{are essential to}} ensures competitiveness of future aircraft concepts and composite materials provide {{a wide range of}} technological options that can be utilized to optimise the wing for its application scenario. The developed “Shoe Box” upper wing cover structure is fully integrated and based on toughened prepreg for the skin and the backing structure. In case of the skin laminate a robot based multi head ATL (Automatic Tape Laying) concept has been chosen because it allows to increase the lay-up rate without exceeding a critical lay-up speed and limits the investment costs because flexible standard robots and rail systems can be used. To realize the stringer/rib cap backing structure box like <b>tooling</b> <b>modules</b> are wrapped with prepreg fabric and combined in a way that stringers and rib caps are formed. To provide the required consolidation pressure for the prepreg a material mix of aluminum and Invar is used where the thermal expansion of the aluminum compresses the prepreg stack. To provide maximum geometrical precision each <b>tooling</b> <b>module</b> is mechanically linked to an Invar base plate. Since it is a known problem that heating and cooling of massive tooling constructions is critical for the cycle time hollow <b>tooling</b> <b>modules</b> where applied. To further increase heat-up and cool down rates the air flow of the autoclave was lead through the <b>tooling</b> <b>modules.</b> Finally Skin lay-up and backing structure lay-up together with their dedicated tools are combined. The resulting tooling set-up is an partly elastic closed autoclave mould without vacuum bags. High precision GOM ATOS measuring equipment has been used to prove the excellent geometrical accuracy. ...|$|R

Findings: The results of the experimental investigations of technological capabilities of four types of Levitation <b>Tool</b> <b>Modules</b> (LTM) have been presented. The optimal design and technological parameters of the modules have been established to control {{the characteristics of the}} surface layer quality. We have developed and experimentally investigated LTM for high-speed wire-brushing of materials. The possibility of ensuring the part surface quality by transportation of various lubricating and cooling technological means in the treatment zone was examined.

The {{cross section of the}} spent fuel assemblies range from a 4. 575 -in. hexagonal shrouded to a 8. 75 -in. square grid-unshrouded. A number of interrelated initial design problems had to be solved: a hydraulic force system arrangement with minimum spacing between cylinders; readily removable couplings between the force system and associated tooling submodule; couplings with maximum stiffness and minimum geometry; a roller bearing system for each tool submodule and hydraulic stem assembly; and long life tool operation under high loads, wear, high temperaure, and corrosive conditions. It was established that the cylinder arrangement should consist of three 200 -ton, 10 -in. dia tandem cylinders, and one 100 -ton, 10 -in. dia standard cylinder at 3000 psi operating pressure. The shear would be operated by two - 200 ton tandem cylinders in a vertical straddle mode about the horizontal center line of the tooling arrangement.

40|$|Abstract: A Tooling and Production Strategy for a Fully Integral, High Production Rate NLF Upper Wing Skin. Producing large {{integral}} composite components {{at a high}} {{production rate}} is a major challenge because the required level of process maturity is extremely high. Further more only a highly streamlined and optimised production approach can provide the required competitiveness. For a typical single aisle aircraft wing skin a length of up to 20 m and typical laminate thicknesses of up to 25 mm can be expected. In addition only secondary bonding or fully integral design approaches can provide the surface smoothness required for Natural Laminar Flow capabilities. In {{the framework of the}} LUFOIV Project LaWiPro it was decided to go for a fully integral design approach with integrated stringers and integrated rib caps following the tradition of the first Airbus CFRP VTP. In order to optimise the production sequence priority was given to minimised set-up and processing times. The so called “Shoe Box” solution that is currently investigated is based on a manufacturing optimised wing skin design without undercuts and interleaved Stringer, Rib Cap and Wing Skin plies. The production sequence starts with the wrapping of Hollow <b>Tooling</b> <b>Modules</b> that are afterwards combined to a row. Several rows of wrapped <b>Tooling</b> <b>Modules</b> are than placed on the referencing tooling base plate and covered with additional wing skin plies. After the set-up phase the tool is closed and placed in an autoclave or convection oven. To reduce the cycle time the Hollow <b>Tooling</b> <b>Modules</b> are connected to the process environment and there is a controlled airflow through the <b>Tooling</b> <b>Modules.</b> In the end the geometrical precision of the aerodynamic surfaces and also the joining areas is investigated with a contact-free high precision GOM-ATOS measuring equipment. Even though the first trials are based on prepreg it is an option to combine the prepreg wing skin laminate (e. g. ATL, AFP) with infused stringers and rib caps (Combined Prepreg Infusion (CPI)) or to chose a complete Infusion based approach. To evaluate the competitiveness of the “Shoe Box” solution all activities are accompanied by a related cost assessment that indicates areas that need to be improved from a maturity point of view or where automation concepts could be successfully applied to further reduce production costs. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an e-Design framework for knowledge management through its application in an engineering design case study. The e-Design framework enables {{the implementation of}} integrated design information throughout the entire design process. It facilitates the ease of sharing real time information across multiple individual designers, departments, or organizations as would be required in large scale design efforts. Similarly, it allows for the ease of use of technical tools integral to the design process that small design departments depend upon. Thus, regardless of the scale, the efficiency of engineering design can be improved {{with the use of}} the e-Design framework. The many features of the e-Design framework are exemplified through its application in a practical industry design problem. The case study in this paper addresses the utility and ease of use of this framework and provides one potential implementation method. This study involves a representative application of an innovative new mast design to elevate a surveillance camera on a military vehicle. The design process utilizes the NIST functional basis [3] to improve effectiveness and efficiency during conceptual design.

Additional benefits include storing of the information generated at the early stages for sharing and reuse throughout the entire design process. Most of all, improved transparent communication throughout the design process will reduce duplication of efforts and trial and error occurrences...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{prototype}} automated disassembly system {{was developed for}} the disposal of end-of-life electronics. The system was designed to handle a family of electronic devices whose plastic, cantilever snap-fit covers house AA or AAA batteries. Examples of these devices {{included in the study}} were a TV remote control and a TI- 84 scientific calculator. The main focus of the prototype system was the design of an automated disassembly tool with the ability to remove the snap-fit cover and the batteries contained within. The design concept conceived to release the snap-fit and the batteries was a force sensing tool tip utilizing force sensing resistors (FSRs). The sensor feedback from the FSRs was used to control the movement of the tool during disassembly operations. A pneumatically actuated vacuum gripper and electromagnet system was developed for recovering the snap-fit cover and batteries once they were released by the disassembly tool. The disassembly module was mounted on the tool head of a three-axis translational motion robot. A Visual Basic GUI was developed to interface and control the robot with a Galil digital motion controller. The Visual Basic application was used to program an automated disassembly routine for the removal of the snap-fit cover and batteries. A model-based computer vision application was also developed in Visual C++ using a Kinect sensor and the OpenCV library to identify and localize the electronic device placed on the disassembly robot. The information gathered by the model-based computer vision application was used by the robot to load the necessary device parameters and compute the snap-fit and battery coordinates.
