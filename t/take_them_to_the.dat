5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists at the {{monument}} find, describe the location of, and collect fossil-bearing rocks {{from more than}} 700 sites. They <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> paleontology laboratory at the visitor center, where the fossils are stabilized, separated from their rock matrix, and cleaned. The fossil specimens are then catalogued, indexed, stored in climate-controlled cabinets, and made available for research. In addition to preparing fossils, the paleontologists coordinate {{the monument}}'s basic research in paleobotany and other scientific areas and manage the fossil museum in the visitor center.|$|E

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, {{in return for a}} flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to round up people from Portland saloons, and then <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, the island's {{location}} made it {{an ideal}} base for smuggling. It has been alleged that an old mine shaft {{on the north side}} of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels, and a concealed exit to the sea. Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband, mainly tea and brandy.|$|E

Both Eberstein and Schack marched towards Odense, meeting up on November 12. So far, the invasion of Funen was going smoothly for the combined Danish and allied forces.|$|E

5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, Misch {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E

25|$|Brazil's {{win over}} the hosts helped <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final against Italy. While Brazil's path was {{relatively}} smooth as they defeated the Netherlands in the quarterfinals and Sweden in the semis, the Italians had made hard work of reaching the final. During the group stage Italy struggled and narrowly advanced to the next round, despite losing 1–0 to the Republic of Ireland. Italian playmaker Roberto Baggio, who {{was expected to be}} one of the stars of the tournament, had not yet scored a goal. During the Round of 16 game against Nigeria, Italy was trailing 1–0 in the dying minutes when Baggio scored the tying goal, forcing the game into extra time. He scored again with a penalty kick to send Italy through. Baggio carried the Italians from there, scoring the game-winning goal in the quarterfinal against Spain, and both goals in Italy's semifinal victory over Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|The City {{station was}} not {{originally}} called Bank. The Central London Railway (CLR, {{which became the}} central section {{of what is now}} the Central line) obtained an Act of Parliament in 1891 varying their previously-intended route, to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area of the present-day Bank station. The act required them to construct a central station and booking office and public subways connecting the surrounding streets. The subways were to be regarded as public, although maintained by the CLR. Any other railway intending to have a station nearby was entitled to connect to the CLR station by subways. This obviously referred to the Waterloo & City line, and was designed to create a single station frontage in the congested street area. The CLR completed its construction after the W but was obliged to finish the facilities necessary for the earlier opening of the W The City and South London Railway (CSLR) also operated from the station.|$|E
