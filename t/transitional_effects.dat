Some geometrical parameters can be controlled in order to optimize the coupling condition for SPP propagation.

The primary objective {{of this study was}} to measure the aerodynamic properties of three commercially available sport fabrics using a standard cylinder methodology over a range of Reynolds numbers and stretch conditions alone with microscopic analysis.

In this model barriers affect both the beginning date and the pace of the modern economic growth. A fundamental property of the model is that cross country income differences matches the inverted U-shape pattern over time as observed in the data, hence implies a substantial fraction of existing income differences is really a transitional phenomenon. Relative to papers that model this as steady state phenomenon, my model requires a smaller size of barriers to account for current disparities. Another important finding is that this <b>transitional</b> <b>effect</b> increases significantly when I include the fact that today's low-income countries have had higher population growth rates during their early development stage than did the currently rich countries. In a quantitative exercise I find that given the beginning dates of modern growth, the model accounts for a significant portion of current income differences.

40|$|Australia’s {{household}} sector appears {{to hold a}} greater proportion of its wealth in dwellings than do households in other countries. Average dwelling prices in Australia also appear to be high relative to household income, but dwellings in Australia are not noticeably higher in quality than those in comparable countries. This concentration of wealth in housing also does not seem attributable to government policies that encourage dwelling investment in Australia {{to a greater extent than}} is true overseas. A possible reconciliation of this pattern may be the unusual concentration of Australia’s population in two large cities. Average housing prices tend to be higher in larger cities than smaller ones. Therefore, the expensive cities in Australia drag up the average level of dwelling prices more than in other countries, resulting in a higher share of wealth concentrated in housing. The increasing importance of dwelling wealth in Australia over recent years largely reflects the consequences of disinflation and financial deregulation.

40|$|The {{demographic}} transition {{a change from}} high to low rates of mortality and fertility has been more dramatic in East Asia during this century {{than in any other}} region or historical period. By introducing demographic variables into an empirical model of economic growth, this essay shows that this transition has contributed substantially to East Asia's so-called economic miracle. The 'miracle' occurred in part because East Asia's {{demographic transition}} resulted in its working-age population growing at a much faster pace than its dependent population during the period 1965 - 1990, thereby expanding the per capita productive capacity of East Asian economies. This effect was not inevitable; rather, it occured because East Asian countries had social, economic, and political institutions and policies that allowed them to realize the growth potential created by the transition. The empirical analyses indicate that population growth has a purely <b>transitional</b> <b>effect</b> on economic growth; this effect operates only when the dependent and working-age populations are growing at different rates. An important implication of these results is that future demographic change will tend to depress growth rates in East Asia, while it will promote more rapid economic growth in Southeast and South Asia. ...|$|R

40|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of methylmercury (MeHg) in freshwater ecosystems are of major environmental concern in {{large parts of}} the northern hemisphere. Beaver ponds have been identified as a potentially important source of MeHg. The role of beavers might be especially pronounced in large parts of Europe, where beaver populations have expanded rapidly following near-extirpation. This study evaluates the role of the age and colonization history (encompassing patterns of use and reuse) of ponds constructed by the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber in regulating MeHg concentrations in Swedish streams. In 12 beaver systems located in three regions, we quantified MeHg concentrations together with other relevant parameters on five occasions per year in 2012 - 2013. Five were pioneer systems, inundated {{for the first time since}} beaver extirpation, and seven were recolonized, with dams reconstructed by newly recolonizing beavers. MeHg concentrations in pioneer but not in recolonized beaver systems were up to 3. 5 fold higher downstream than upstream of the ponds, and varied between seasons and years. Our results show that pioneer inundation by beavers can increase MeHg concentrations in streams, but that this effect is negligible when dams are reconstructed on previously used ponds. We therefore expect that the recovery and expansion of beavers in the boreal system will only have a <b>transitional</b> <b>effect</b> on MeHg in the environment...|$|R

Design The study is {{based on data from}} three Swiss Food Panel survey periods. A cross-sectional comparison between household types was conducted by using a one-way independent ANOVA. Repeated measures were analysed with a mixed ANCOVA to examine changes in dietary behaviour following a life event. Setting Participants in the survey filled in a questionnaire in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. Subjects The final sample consisted of 3559 persons {{with a mean age of}} 56 years (range 22 - 94 years; 46 % men). Seventy-two people moved in with their partner and sixty-five people reported the birth of their first child. Results Cross-sectional evidence confirmed that women living in households with a partner reported higher consumption frequencies for meat and processed meats compared with those living alone. Men living in cohabitation had a higher vegetable intake. The <b>transitional</b> <b>effect</b> of moving in with a partner, however, resulted in a higher intake of processed meats for both genders and a higher intake of pork and savoury items for men. Transition to motherhood was linked to an increase in vegetable consumption, while the transition to fatherhood did not change consumption patterns significantly.
