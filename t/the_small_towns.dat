25|$|Traditional Faroese food {{is mainly}} based on meat, seafood and {{potatoes}} and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the Faroe sheep {{is the basis}} of many meals, {{and one of the most}} popular treats is skerpikjøt, well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a hjallur, is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> and villages. Other traditional foods are ræst kjøt (semi-dried mutton) and ræstur fiskur, matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is tvøst og spik, pilot whale meat and blubber. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with offal is garnatálg.) Meat and blubber from a pilot whale means food for a long time. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do seabirds, such as Faroese puffins, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.|$|E
25|$|Before 1888, <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> {{and rural}} areas in Devon were governed by magistrates through the Devon Court of Quarter Sessions. The magistrates were based at Rougemont Castle, Exeter, and were not elected by the people. In 1888, the Local Government Act 1888 was passed, which {{paved the way for}} {{democracy}} at the county level throughout England and Wales. On 16 January 1889, the first County Council elections were held, and the council began life with a budget of £50,000. In 1907, women became eligible for election and the first female councillor was elected in 1931. From the beginning in 1889, the county boroughs of Exeter, Devonport and Plymouth were outside the jurisdiction of the county council. Devonport was afterwards absorbed by the City of Plymouth. Torbay received county borough status and left the area of Devon County Council in 1968.|$|E
