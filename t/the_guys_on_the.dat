500|$|Woolfolk {{was named}} the Most Valuable Player in both of Michigan's two bowl game {{appearances}} in 1981. [...] During the January 1981 Rose Bowl, he gained 182 yards against Washington, and during the December 1981 Bluebonnet Bowl, in which he gained 186 yards against UCLA. The hotel where the Wolverines team was staying was evacuated {{the night before the}} 1981 Rose Bowl game when a fire alarm was triggered at 2:30a.m., and Woolfolk only had three hours of sleep that night. [...] He won the MVP award despite the lack of sleep, and after the game Woolfolk called the game his [...] "greatest thrill in football." [...] Commenting on the MVP trophy, Woolfolk said: [...] "If I could, I'd break this trophy into 95 pieces and hand it out to all <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> squad." [...] After winning his second MVP trophy in 1981's Bluebonnet Bowl, Woolfolk said: [...] "I might look back in later years and notice that, but right now all I can think about is that I've worn a Michigan uniform for the last time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bostic's {{physical}} {{style of play}} was respected by his peers: Lester Hayes said Raider tight end Todd Christensen is the best receiving tight end and that [...] "The only guy I've ever seen cover Todd is my son, Keith Bostic...Bostic's the only guy I've ever seen pulverize him. I mean he really pulverized him. I call Bostic and Frank Minnifield (Cleveland cornerback) my sons, my sons of dirt." [...] Hayes meant that Bostic and Minnifield played a {{physical style}}, just like Hayes. [...] Bostic {{is known as a}} big hitter blessed with athletic ability. [...] He combined strength and speed to play his physical style according to Ozzie Newsome: [...] "He's as strong as any linebacker and can run like any of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner." [...] Bostic earned the nickname [...] "Batman" [...] for his style of play. [...] Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to [...] "...pick the three toughest guys. If somebody throws a grenade into a room, they're the ones who'll jump on it." [...] Bostic was the player chosen from the Oilers' defense. [...] Although much is made of his strength and toughness, it should also be mentioned that he once collared Tony Dorsett from behind in a footrace. [...] At one point in Bostic's career, while Glanville was still defensive coordinator, the Oilers considered moving him to cornerback because of his speed.|$|E

Clint (Bowyer) and Brian (Vickers) were up front all day long. This just {{says a lot about}} everything that everybody at MWR has done over the off season – working hard, giving us good race cars. We got off in the mid-part of the race, but had the race strategy at the end and a fast enough car to stay up there.” Earnhardt regretted colliding with team-mate Jeff Gordon, “I’m mad because I screwed myself on pit road speeding. I’m pretty upset about that. Otherwise, I feel bad about running into Jeff’s car. I had a good day other than that. I had a good time. … I feel bad about what happened with Jeff, but damn, we were just racing." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 6:28a.m., {{two minutes}} {{ahead of the}} time set as H-Hour, Schroeder's unit {{was in the first}} wave of 20LCVPs to {{disembark}} on Utah Beach. Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach. [...] "They were dropping all those bombs on the place where we were going in" [...] and his company had to disembark [...] "without getting bombed by our own guys". [...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if {{he knew that he was}} the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was actually going to be the first ashore. [...] Besides, I was too scared to think about it". Afterwards, he was hailed in a Pentagon press release as [...] "the first GI to invade Europe". The Baltimore Sun said of Schroeder afterwards, [...] "when his boot touched French soil, it was a great moment in history". He earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during World War II, in addition to numerous other decorations.|$|E
