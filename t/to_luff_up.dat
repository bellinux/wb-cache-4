"No, sir, so I thought, myself; and I only {{tried to}} look as melancholy as a young gentleman who is sent below to report a topgallant-mast over the side, or a studding-sail-boom gone in the iron. D'ye {{remember}} the time, Admiral Blue, when you thought <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> on the old Planter's weather-quarter, and get {{between her and the}} French ninety on three decks, and how your stu'n-sails went, one a'ter another, just like so many musherrooms breaking in peeling?" ...|$|E
60|$|The man at {{the wheel}} knew very well what was wanted, {{and he put his}} helm up, instead of putting it down, as he might have done without this injunction. As this change brought the brig before the wind, and Spike was in no hurry <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> on the other tack, the Swash soon ran over a mile of the {{distance}} she had already made, putting her back that much {{on her way to the}} Neck. It is out of our power to say what the people of the different craft in sight thought of all this, but an opportunity soon offered of putting them on a wrong scent. A large coasting schooner, carrying everything that would draw on a wind, came sweeping under the stern of the Swash, and hailed.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} before the Druid was within a hundred fathoms of the flag-ship, on her weather-quarter, shoving the brine before her in a way to denote a fearful momentum. It was evidently the {{intention}} of Captain Blewet to cross the Plantagenet's stern, and <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> under her lee quarter; the safest point at which he could approach, in so heavy a swell, provided it were done with discretion. Captain Blewet had a reputation for handling his frigate like a boat, and the occasion was one which would be likely to awaken all his desire to sustain the character he had already earned. Still no one could imagine how he was to come near enough to make a communication of any length. The stentorian lungs of the second lieutenant, however, might effect it; and, as the news of the expected hail passed through the ship, many who had remained below, in apathy, while the enemy was close under their lee, came on deck, curious to witness what was about to pass.|$|E
50|$|The {{hull and}} large sail-plan give the Medina speed {{comparable}} to many 25-footers. However, when overpressed {{with too much}} sail, the boat will have a tendency <b>to</b> gripe (<b>luff</b> <b>up</b> without tiller input) or even broach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, and a most partic'lar fine officer he is, {{as every}} body says. Well, sir, he's with the ladies; while his namesake {{has gone back}} to the table, and has put <b>luff</b> upon <b>luff,</b> <b>to</b> fetch <b>up</b> leeway." ...|$|R
60|$|After a time {{he heard}} a whistle, and the light ahead stopped; {{then there was a}} roar of running chain, and as he <b>luffed</b> <b>up</b> a shout reached him.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} of the basins named, the {{schooner}} wore short round on her heel, her foresail being set to help her. A breathless moment passed as she ran down towards the narrow strait. It was quickly reached, and that none too soon; the opening now not exceeding sixty feet. The yards of the vessel almost brushed the rocks in passing; but she went clear. As soon as in the lower basin, as one might call it, the jib and foresail were taken in, {{and the head of the}} mainsail was got on the craft. This helped her <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> towards the slip, which she reached under sufficient head-way fairly to enter it. Lines were thrown to the people on the ice, who soon hauled the schooner up to the head of her frozen dock. Three cheers broke spontaneously out of the throats of the men, as they thus achieved the step which assured them of the safety of the vessel, so far as the ice was concerned! In this way do we estimate our advantages and disadvantages, by comparison. In the abstract, the situation of the sealers was still sufficiently painful; though compared with what it would have been with the other schooner wrecked, it was security itself.|$|E
60|$|The little {{conflict}} between the English ships {{and the head of}} the French line, the evolutions that had grown out of it, the crippling of le Foudroyant, and the continuance of the gale, contributed to produce material changes in the relative positions of the two fleets. All the English vessels kept their stations with beautiful accuracy, still running to the southward in a close line ahead, having the wind a trifle abaft the beam, with their yards braced in. Under the circumstances, it needed but some seven or eight minutes for these ships to glide a mile through the troubled ocean, and this was about the period the most exposed of them all had been under the random and slow fire that the state of the weather permitted. The trifling damages sustained were already repaired, or in a way soon to be so. On the other hand, considerable disorder prevailed among the French. Their line had never been perfect, extending quite a league; a few of the leading vessels, or those near the commander-in-chief, sustaining each other as well as could be desired, while long intervals existed between the ships astern. Among the latter, too, as has been stated, some were much farther to windward than the others; an irregularity that proceeded from a desire of the Comte <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> as near as possible to the enemy--a desire, which, practised on, necessarily threw the least weatherly vessels to leeward. Thus the two ships in the extreme rear, as has been hinted at already, being jammed up unusually hard upon the wind, had weathered materially on their consorts, while their way through the water had been proportionably less. It was these combined circumstances which brought them so far astern and to windward.|$|E
6000|$|... “We’d {{have about}} two feet under her at the bend, and if she didn’t <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> handy she’d sure go ashore,” he said. “Seems to me the chances are too blamed steep.” ...|$|R
6000|$|But not in art. Afterwards {{the master}} {{said to me}} in a shy mumble, [...] "She wouldn't <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> in time, somehow. What's the matter with her?" [...] And I made no answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boat!" [...] {{interrupted}} Marble. [...] "What {{more have}} we {{to do with}} the boat? No--no--Miles; let this Mr. Sennit go to England where he belongs. Now, see how I'll manage Diggens," [...] he added; [...] "I want <b>to</b> get a <b>luff</b> purchase <b>up</b> out of the forecastle;--will you just order two or three of your fellows forward, to go down and pass it up for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wind is south-south-west, and we {{can have}} her up four points closer to the wind, and still be six points off the wind. As she <b>luffs</b> <b>up</b> we shall man the fore and main sheets, slack on the weather, and haul on the lee braces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, Luka, and I {{will stand}} up and have a look. Yes, it is {{as much as they}} will do to cut us off. They did not {{calculate}} on our coming along so fast. I will <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> a little more, and we shall pass ahead of them however hard they paddle." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1912, Stothert & Pitt's design team, led by Claude Topliss, {{developed}} an improved design of level luffing gear, which greatly improved {{the speed and}} efficiency of cargo handling cranes fitted with it[...] This used an arrangement of compensating hoist cables to automatically keep the hook, and load, level as the jib was <b>luffed</b> <b>up</b> and down.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely was {{the order}} obeyed when the brig, {{which was now}} on the port quarter, <b>luffed</b> <b>up</b> a little into the wind, and fired a {{broadside}} of eight guns. There was a crashing of wood. The Madras was hulled in three places; two more holes appeared in her sails; while the other shot passed harmlessly just astern of her.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not a}} mere boat, not a mere canoe, but a sailing machine. And the man in it sailed it by {{his weight}} and his nerve--principally by the latter. I watched the canoe beat up from leeward and run in toward the village, its sole {{occupant}} far out on the outrigger and <b>luffing</b> <b>up</b> and spilling {{the wind in the}} puffs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what it is, shippies!" [...] cried the old captain of gun No. 1 on the forecastle, [...] "if that 'ere President of ourn don't <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> into the wind, by the Battle of the Nile! he'll be getting us into a grand fleet {{engagement}} afore the Yankee nation has rammed home her cartridges--let alone blowing the match!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a collier," [...] Griffith said, [...] "who has hauled {{from the}} land in the late gale, and who is <b>luffing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his course again. If the wind holds here in the south, {{and he does not}} get into that fog-bank, we can stand off for him and get a supply of fuel before eight bells are struck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a good}} boat, and a fast boat too," [...] {{observed}} Jack Tier, {{after he}} had <b>luffed</b> <b>up</b> several minutes, {{in order to make}} sure of his proximity to the reef; [...] "and it might carry us all safe enough to Key West, or certainly back to the Dry Tortugas, was we inclined to try our hands at either." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'd {{have kept}} to weather of the bark, where we'd have had room <b>to</b> <b>luff,</b> if I'd {{expected}} that burst of wind," [...] he explained. [...] "Did you hurt yourself against the coaming, Mrs. Nairn?" ...|$|R
25|$|Niagara {{broke through}} the British line ahead of Detroit and Queen Charlotte and <b>luffed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fire raking broadsides from ahead of them, while Caledonia and the American gunboats fired from astern. Although the crews of Detroit and Queen Charlotte managed to untangle the two ships {{they could no longer}} offer any {{effective}} resistance. Both ships surrendered at about 3:00pm. The smaller British vessels tried to flee but were overtaken and also surrendered.|$|R
50|$|Bermuda mainsails {{may have}} slides {{attached}} <b>to</b> the <b>luff</b> that match tracks on the mast and boom. These may be attached <b>to</b> the <b>luff</b> through grommets with webbing or a nylon shackle or with webbing sewn {{directly on the}} sail.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the gentlemen}} waved {{their hands in}} adieu as usual, and la Victoire, clipped as she was of her wings, drew slowly past. The Druid succeeded, and Sir Gervaise simply gave Blewet his orders to see the prize into port, and to look after his own foremast. This ended the field day; the frigate <b>luffing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{windward}} of the line again, leaving the Plantagenet in its rear. A few minutes later, the latter ship filled and stood after her consorts.|$|R
60|$|That craft had indeed, at first, <b>luffed</b> <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> {{come to the}} {{assistance}} of her consort; but on seeing {{the fall of the}} latter's mast, and that she was incapable of rendering any assistance, had again altered her course, feeling her incapacity to engage so redoubtable an opponent, single handed. Three hearty cheers broke from all on board the Madras as, after pouring in a broadside at a distance of fifty yards, she left the brig behind her, and proceeded on her way.|$|R
50|$|Ljungström also {{developed}} a solution to easily adjust the mast tilt (forward / backward) through a roll in the mast foot (April 1921). In this way, the mast relatively easily tilted fore and aft to adjust the boat's ltendency <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> depending on wind strength.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir; we are {{friendly}} enough at odd times, though a breeze often springs up between us. Guinea has a d--d awkward fashion of <b>luffing</b> <b>up</b> in his talk; and your Honour knows it isn't always comfortable {{to a white}} man to be driven to leeward by a black. I tell him it is inconvenient. He is a good enough fellow in the main, howsomever, sir; and, as he is just an African bred and born, I hope you'll {{be good enough to}} overlook his little failings." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{unrelated}} explanation {{states that}} sailors {{going up the}} Chester River had <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> their sails as they rounded Love Point due to a strong northwesterly wind.

50|$|In 1999 he {{developed}} the first bridleless arch style ram air kite, primarily for kitesurfing. Arc style kites are generally more efficient (better upwind performance) and are more resistant <b>to</b> <b>luffing</b> (more stable and reliable in gusty conditions) relative to leading edge inflatable (LEI) sled kites but have slightly lower lift coefficient (less power from the same size kite).|$|R
60|$|The {{next step}} was to find the {{southern}} end of the outer ledge that formed the succeeding passage. This was not done until the ship was close aboard of it. A change had come over the spot within the last few hours, in consequence of the increase of wind, the water breaking all along the ledge, instead of on its end only; but Mark cared not for this, once certain he had found that end. He was now half-way between his former anchorage and the crater, and he could distinguish the latter quite plainly. But sail was necessary to carry the ship safely through the channel ahead, and Mark called to Bob to lash the helm a-midships after <b>luffing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his course, and to spring to the main-topmast staysail halliards, and help him hoist the sail. This was soon done, and the new sail was got up, and the sheet hauled aft. Next followed the mizen staysail, which was spread in the same manner. Bob then flew to the wheel, and Mark to his knight-heads again. Contrary to Mark's apprehensions, he saw that the ship was <b>luffing</b> <b>up</b> close <b>to</b> the weather ledge, leaving little danger of her going on to it. As soon as met by the helm, however, she fell off, and Mark no longer had any doubt of weathering the northern end of the inner ledge of this passage. The wind coming in fresher puffs, this was soon done, when the ship was kept dead away for the crater. There was the northern end of the reef, which formed the inner basin of all, to double, when that which remained to do was merely to range far enough within the reef to get a cover, and to drop the anchor. In order to do this with success, Mark now commenced hauling down the jib. By the time he had that sail well in, the ship was off the end of the sunken reef, when Bob put his helm a-starboard and rounded it. Down came the main-topmast staysail, and Mark jumped on the forecastle, while he called out to Bob to lash the helm a-lee. In an instant Bob was at the young man's side, and both waited for the ship <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> into the wind, and to forge as near as possible to the reef. This was successfully done also, and Mark let go the stopper within twenty feet of the wall of the sunken reef, just as the ship began to drive astern. The canvas was rolled up and secured, the cable payed out, until the ship lay just mid-channel between the island and the sea-wall without, and the whole secured. Then Bob took off his tarpaulin and gave three cheers, while Mark walked aft, silently returning thanks to God for the complete success of this important movement.|$|R
60|$|I {{stared at}} Captain Colenso. Could he mean to {{surrender}} without one blow? He had exchanged his glass for a speaking trumpet, and waited, fumbling with it, his face twitching painfully. A cold, dishonouring suspicion gripped me. The man {{was here to}} betray his flag. I glanced aloft: the British ensign flew at the peak. And as I turned my head, I felt rather than saw the flash, heard the shattering din as the puzzled American <b>luffed</b> <b>up</b> and let fly across our bows with a raking broadside. Doubtless she, too, took note of our defiant ensign, and leaped at the nearest guess that we meant to run her aboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{call that}} Wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise {{it has a}} foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman--the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He <b>luffs</b> <b>up</b> before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round {{on the other side}} of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he's back again; what does that mean?

60|$|The wind freshened a bit, and the Reindeer {{went over}} farther than ever. For the moment I {{thought she was}} gone, and I knew that another puff like that and she surely would go. While I pressed her under and debated whether I should give up or not, the Chinese cried for mercy. I {{think it was the}} sweetest sound I have ever heard. And then, and not until then, did I <b>luff</b> <b>up</b> and ease out the main-sheet. The Reindeer righted very slowly, and when she was on an even keel was so much awash that I doubted if she could be saved.|$|R
