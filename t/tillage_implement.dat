40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{ability of}} <b>tillage</b> <b>implements</b> to {{maintain}} surface residue coverage is largely {{dependent on the}} implement’s main active component. Two categories of <b>tillage</b> <b>implements</b> were compared to determine their ability to maintain grain sorghum (non–fragile) surface residue coverage when operating at two different tillage depths for fall and spring <b>tillage.</b> Chisel–type <b>implements</b> were found to bury substantially less crop residue than disk–type implements. Disk–type implements were found to bury increased amounts of crop residue when operating at deeper tillage depths. Fall and spring tillage were also found to leave equivalent amounts of percent residue cover and total mass of crop residue remaining on the soil surface. A more thorough understanding of the ability of <b>tillage</b> <b>implements</b> to maintain adequate amounts of surface residue coverage should enable producers to select appropriate implements to maximize production while minimizing erosion...|$|R

5000|$|The {{land that}} Charles Noble farmed in {{southern}} Alberta sits {{in what is}} known as the dry-belt. During the period of drought known as the dirty thirties, farmland within the dry-belt, cultivated with mold-board plow and/or double disc and summer fallowed every other year, was subject to massive soil erosion. In 1935, while on a visit to California, Noble observed a sugar beet farmer using a straight blade tool to cut into the subsoil beneath the beets to loosen them for harvesting. He noticed that the blade was disturbing and killing weeds without burying them. Noble realized if he could apply a similar implement to the dry land back in Alberta thus leaving the crop stubble as [...] "trash" [...] on top to hold the soil and protect it from blowing the problem of soil erosion may be solved. He immediately fabricated a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> patterned after the sugar beet harvesting tool. He called his invention the Noble blade. The next year he carried out all his summer fallow work using his invention. The results were so successful by 1937 he had fabricated 50 of the implements which he sold to friends and neighbors. By 1941 a factory was built within the village of Nobleford. Sales of the Noble blade occurred throughout the dry land farming areas of the world. The Noble blade is touted as one of the most important agricultural inventions of the 20th century. In 1982 the company that Noble had founded was sold to Versatile Manufacturing Ltd. Today, variations of the Noble blade, produced by all the major farm equipment manufacturers, have supplanted the mold board plow as the main <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> in use.|$|E
50|$|Porosity {{of surface}} soil {{typically}} decreases as particle size increases. This {{is due to}} soil aggregate formation in finer textured surface soils when subject to soil biological processes. Aggregation involves particulate adhesion and higher resistance to compaction. Typical bulk density of sandy soil is between 1.5 and 1.7 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.43 and 0.36. Typical bulk density of clay soil is between 1.1 and 1.3 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.58 and 0.51. This seems counterintuitive because clay soils are termed heavy, implying lower porosity. Heavy apparently refers to a gravitational moisture content effect in combination with terminology that harkens back to the relative force required to pull a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> through the clayey soil at field moisture content as compared to sand.|$|E

5000|$|To {{the extent}} that {{cultivating}} is done commercially today (such as in truck farming), it is usually powered by tractors, especially row-crop tractors. Industrial cultivators can vary greatly in size and shape, from 10 ft to 80 ft wide. Many are equipped with hydraulic wings that fold up to make road travel easier and safer. Different types are used for preparation of fields before planting, and for the control of weeds between row crops. The cultivator may be an implement trailed after the tractor via a drawbar; mounted on the three-point hitch; or mounted on a frame beneath the tractor. Active cultivator implements are driven by a power take-off shaft. While most cultivator are considered a secondary <b>tillage</b> <b>implement,</b> active cultivators are commonly used for primary tillage in lighter soils instead of plowing. The largest versions available are about 6 m wide, and require a tractor with an excess of [...] (PTO) to drive them.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{state of the}} seedbed is of importance to the plant environment as it influences some important processes in the soil such as seedling emergence, water and solute transport, and ease of root penetration. This is affected {{to a large extent}} by tillage process, the <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> type and the geometry of the implement used. A field experiment was carried out on a clay soil to determine the effect of the geometry of bladed tillage implements on some soil physical properties after tillage. The soil properties evaluated were bulk density, mean clod size distribution and total pore space after tillage and the extent of loosening achieved. Implement parameters considered were blade width, rake angle and depth of operation of the implement. Two blade widths of 75 and 150 mm were evaluated in combination with three rake angles of 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Each <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> was drawn through the soil at four operating depths of 100, 150, 200 and 250 mm. Larger rake angles were observed to result in larger mean aggregate sizes and greater bulk density reductions when compared to smaller rake angles. Greater reduction in bulk density was observed with the wider of the two blade widths evaluated. Mean clod size after tillage was also observed to be large for the wider of the two widths evaluated. Irrespective of width and rake angle, greater operating depths resulted in larger mean clod sizes and greater reductions in bulk density as compared to shallower operating depths. Fractal analysis showed the extent of fragmentation to be greater at shallower operating depths, hence the small mean clod sizes obtained...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} influence of cover crop biomass incorporated into the soil at different times and using different treatments on carrot emergence and growth. 7 species of cover crops were included in the study: Secale cereale, Avena sativa, Vicia sativa, Sinapis alba, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Fagopyrum esculentum, and Helianthus annuus.   			 			Number of emerged carrot plants significantly depended on the cover crop used and on the method of pre-winter and spring pre-sowing tillage. Carrot emerged best after a rye or oats cover crop. Regardless of the cover crop species used, the largest number of carrots emerged in cultivation on ridges. In other variants of no-plow tillage, number of seedlings was significantly lower and did not differ from that under traditional plow tillage. The highest leaf rosettes were formed by carrot growing after a rye or oats cover crop. The highest rosettes were produced by carrots in the treatments where tillage was limited to the use of a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> in spring and the lowest ones after pre-winter plowing. The effect of tillage on the emergence and height of carrot leaves largely depended on weather conditions in the successive years of the study. The largest number of leaves was found in carrots grown after a buckwheat cover crop and in cultivation without cover crop, while the smallest one after phacelia and white mustard. Carrots produced the largest number of leaves after a sunflower cover crop and the use of a <b>tillage</b> <b>implement</b> in spring, while the number of leaves was lowest when the mustard biomass was incorporated into the soil in spring. The use of cover crops significantly increased the mass of leaves produced by carrot as compared to the cultivation without cover crop.
