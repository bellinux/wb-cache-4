40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show what {{relation}} is between the distance and the <b>transport</b> <b>price</b> and which factors can contribute to the expected irregularity. Based on the real freight transport prices the paper is looking for and finding significant differences in the relative transport prices between chosen regions. It seems that the quality of the <b>transport</b> <b>price</b> is influenced by factors like the location of the target region within Europe and towards Czechia, within transportation routes and networks, its economic power and structure and possibly also by the mutual relations that the source and target regions have within the global supply chains. The quality of the transport connection between the regions is further compared with the connection that these regions have within the global city network. As was found out, these two kinds of connection do not have to necessarily be the same. A short questionnaire was taken among chosen transport experts to get the basis for a better interpretation of the paper's conclusions and also to get their opinion on the sense of the geographical research in the field of international transport and logistics.

40|$|According to {{economic}} theory, imbalances in trade flows affect <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> because (some) carriers {{have to return}} without cargo from the low demand region to the high demand region. Therefore, <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> in the high demand direction have to exceed those in the low demand direction. This implies that transport costs, and therefore trade costs, are fundamentally endogenous with respect to trade imbalances. We study this effect using <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> for the inland waterway transport market in north-west Europe. We find that imbalances in trade flows have substantial effects on <b>transport</b> <b>prices.</b> We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the trade imbalance from region A to region B decreases <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> from A to B by about 8 percent.

40|$|This paper {{claims that}} {{distance}} alone {{is a poor}} proxy for international transport costs in gravity equations. We develop a theoretical framework with a manufacturing and a transport sector, where the level of manufacturing exports determines the demand for transport. Above a certain threshold, transport service suppliers find it profit-maximizing to invest into advanced transport technology, which lowers their marginal costs and as a consequence, <b>transport</b> <b>prices.</b> <b>Transport</b> costs therefore vary with {{the distance between the}} two locations, and with the endogenous decision to invest in a more efficient technology. We tackle the biases in traditional gravity estimates by using newly collected data on <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> from UPS and by applying instrument variable estimation techniques. Our results reveal that distance affects trade beyond the transport cost channel. <b>Transport</b> <b>prices,</b> in turn, are influenced by the distance and by the exports between two countries.

40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>pricing</b> {{policies}} are often {{assumed to be}} effective strategies to affect people’s car use, but, {{due to a lack}} of public support, these {{policies are}} often not implemented. Therefore, we examined which factors influence the acceptability of these pricing policies. First, the acceptability of <b>transport</b> <b>pricing</b> policies was shown to be strongly related to the revenue allocation: acceptability increased when revenues were allocated to car users. Second, the acceptability was also shown to increase when people expected car-related problems, such as congestion, pollution and parking problems, to reduce. Reductions in car-related problems will benefit society as a whole, but also individual car users, for example when their travel times decrease or local air quality improves. The acceptability of <b>transport</b> <b>pricing</b> policies increased particularly when people actually experience that car-related problems were solved or decreased. Third, acceptability of <b>transport</b> <b>pricing</b> policies was shown to be strongly related to the extent to which people consider the costs and benefits of these policies to be fairly distributed. We found that <b>transport</b> <b>pricing</b> policies were particularly perceived to be fair and acceptable when the distribution of costs and benefits would benefit nature, the environment and future generations and when everybody would be equally affected. This study has important practical implications: the acceptability of <b>transport</b> <b>pricing</b> policies can be enhanced when it is clearly communicated that pricing policies will result in a reduction of car-related problems. In addition, the acceptability is also likely to increase when people experience the positive effects of policies, for example via trials. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{gap between}} present <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> and {{efficient}} <b>transport</b> <b>prices.</b> Efficient <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> are those prices that maximise economic welfare, including external costs (congestion, air pollution, accidents). The methodology is applied to six urban and interregional case studies using one common optimal pricing model. The case studies cover passenger as well as freight transport and cover all modes. We find that prices need to be raised most for peak urban passenger car transport {{and to a lesser}} extent for interregional road <b>transport.</b> Optimal <b>pricing</b> results for public transport are more mixed. We show that current external costs on congested roads are a bad guide for optimal taxes and tolls: the optimal toll that takes into account the reaction of demand is often less than one third of the present marginal external cost. ...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{numerical}} {{model of the}} urban transportation sector, calibrated to data for Brussels and for London, we calculate the optimal <b>transport</b> <b>price</b> structure {{and its effect on}} the transport equilibrium and on welfare. Removing existing subsidies to public transport and to car parking, internalising transport externalities (mainly congestion) and optimizing the frequency of public transport service increases welfare by approximately 2 % of total income in both cities. Optimal prices are higher than current prices in most transport markets, so that optimal transport demand is below current demand. There is a strong shift to public transport in the peak period. Finally, calculations for Brussels of optimal public transport prices for unchanged reference car taxes indicate that only limited welfare gains can be obtained by charging near-zero fares in peak hours. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of economies of density {{on the characteristics of}} an urban transport system under optimal pricing conditions. Optimal pricing rules are derived for a transport system where bus and car modes are available for peak and offpeak trips. Both modes contribute to congestion. Each demand level for bus trips requires a minimal supply of bus-kilometres. Optimal bus supply exceeds this minimum only when waiting time reductions due to increased service frequency, outweigh congestion costs and bus supply costs (measured at the marginal cost of public funds). An empirical analysis for Brussels and London shows that taking account of economies of density modestly increases the welfare gain from optimising <b>transport</b> <b>prices.</b> Optimal public <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> are lower when economies of density are taken into account, while optimal car prices are not strongly affected. In case car prices are fixed at the reference level, very low or zero public <b>transport</b> <b>prices</b> produce small welfare gains in some cases. transport; congestion; public transport...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the criteria}} {{used in this}} analysis are based on the ones proposed by Bottani and Rizzi [16]. They use the parameters of transport distance, post-haul transport time and the characteristics of the products that are transported to/from these locations to give an estimation of the competiveness of intermodal rail transport compared to road-only transport, as they assume that intermodal transport is only profitable over longer distances, while short post-haul transport times decrease the total logistics cost. Instead of transport distances, in this analysis <b>transport</b> <b>price</b> ratios are compared to provide insight into the price competitiveness of intermodal barge transport in different locations. Values for each of these three parameters are calculated for each geographic entity in the studied region. To combine this information with the volume scores derived in the previous step, the same geographic level of detail is required.|$|E
40|$|According to {{economic}} theory, imbalances in trade flows affect transport prices, because (some) carriers {{have to return}} without cargo from the low-demand region to the high-demand region. Therefore, transport prices in the high-demand direction have to exceed those in the low-demand direction. This implies that transport costs, and therefore trade costs, are fundamentally endogenous with respect to trade imbalances. We study the effect of an imbalance in trade flows on transport prices using micro-data on trips made by carriers in the inland waterway network in North West Europe. We find that imbalances in trade flows have substantial effects on transport prices. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the region's trade imbalance (the ratio of export and import cargo flows) increases the <b>transport</b> <b>price</b> per tonne of trips departing from this region by about 7 %. © The Author (2010).

Key benefits of such hedging strategies would include greater financial predictability, the potential for improved delivery times, and increased local and regional trade that could build on the WFP’s Purchase for Progress initiative.
