If we didn't want to work fast at that time, they wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>us</b> in the brig, and when the exec came down on the docks, they wanted us to slow up." [...] This was the first that the newspaper reporters had heard of speed and tonnage competition between divisions at Port Chicago, and each reporter filed a story featuring this revelation to be published the next day. Naval authorities quickly issued a statement denying Green's allegation.|$|E

The garrison at the Tower took {{matters into their own}} hands after waiting all day for requested help from James's official firemen who were busy in the west. They created firebreaks by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity, halting the advance of the fire. In a letter to William Coventry, Pepys wrote that he [...] "saw how horribly the sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was [...] enough <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>us</b> out of our wits; and, indeed, it was extremely dreadful, for it looks just as if it was at us, and the whole heaven on fire." ...|$|E

During an Inside Soap feature on the Moon {{brothers}} vs the Mitchell brothers, Kate Woodward said [...] "Two sexy brothers to shake up Albert Square? That sounds familiar! But are Anthony and Tyler really the new Grant and Phil Mitchell?" [...] Lapinskas commented on this, saying [...] "It's {{a lot of pressure}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>us</b> both under, but what a duo to be compared to!... Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's nice to have a bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal". Cecile Metcalf of the Daily Mail branded Anthony [...] "the loveable rogue of the square, with a cheeky answer for everything".|$|E

500|$|Besides word {{of mouth}} and {{opinions}} in letters, {{there were only a}} few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described [...] "Strange fits" [...] and [...] "She dwelt" [...] as [...] "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about [...] "I travell'd": [...] "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" [...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>us</b> out of pain as to what it is about." ...|$|E

The Nazis themselves, in their SS, made use of the symbol too. In the same article, Hitchens noted that [...] "The prejudice against bank-monopoly goblins is modeled more or less on anti-Semitism and the foul treatment of elves is meant <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>us</b> in mind of slavery".|$|E

Most of us use the plain 'Winfield' address, simply {{because it is the}} quickest to write. People still say, 'Where's that?' However, after thirty-five years of the same question, we are {{accustomed}} to the remark. [...] Sometimes the remarks, that are given to our town, when a person knows where Winfield is, are far harder to swallow than when he is ignorant of its location. [...] Some of the milder titles are, 'barracks', or 'oh, those places.' We are so tiny, that even state and county cartographers sometimes forget <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>us</b> on their maps.
