5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for {{a new type of}} submarine to replace the Oberon class of diesel-electric submarines began in July 1978, when the RAN director of submarine policy prepared a paper detailing the need to start considering a replacement for the ageing Oberons. The paper also raised the suggestion {{that the majority of the}} submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six Oberons. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting an impossible task because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be done came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the Oberon-class replacement, and led to the view that it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.|$|E

25|$|On 17 June 2010, a Scilly shrew made {{headlines}} on BBC Cornwall when it stowed {{away from the}} Isles of Scilly on Scillonian III. The small 2 in (5 cm) mammal was discovered {{in a corner of}} the Upper Deck as the ferry was about to arrive in Penzance and staff were clearing the area near the gangway. Paul Semmens, the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust's onboard marine guide, identified the animal as a shrew about two months old and looked after it for the night. The next day, the shrew was flown back from Penzance to Scilly on a Skybus plane and released back into its natural environment. Managers at the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company said they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been the smallest passenger ever to travel on Scillonian III and the Skybus.|$|E
25|$|Sin and Punishment was co-developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 and Treasure. Development began around 1997 when Treasure {{wrote the}} {{original}} proposal and submitted it to Nintendo. The original inspiration {{to develop the}} game was {{the design of the}} Nintendo 64 controller. In {{the early days of the}} system's lifespan, Nintendo had suggested two ways of holding the controller, a left and right position. Due to the success of Super Mario 64 which released alongside the console in 1996, many games followed in its trails and featured the same right positioning it used. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, began discussing with his team how the left positioning was underutilized and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> make for an interesting game, and so started developing a new game to use this position. Nintendo warned Treasure that the left positioning would feel unnatural to players at first, however Treasure was already expecting this. Nintendo was also planning a controller accessory at the time with a movement sensor. The team considered adapting the sensor for the game, but ultimately decided against it as it would have lengthened an already dragging development process. The sensor technology was not finalized by Nintendo until the release of the Wii in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, {{there was}} a major debate in the SPD about the tactics it would choose after the lifting of the Anti-Socialist Laws. A radical oppositional wing known as Die Jungen (The Young Ones) developed. While the party leaders viewed the {{parliament}} as a means of social change, Die Jungen <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> at best be used to spread the socialist message. They were unwilling to wait for the collapse of capitalist society, as predicted by Marxism, rather they wanted to start a revolution as soon as possible. Although this wing was strongest in Berlin, Magdeburg, and Dresden, it also had a few adherents in Mainz, among them Rudolf Rocker. In May 1890, he started a reading circle, named Freiheit (Freedom), to study theoretical topics more intensively. After Rocker criticized Jöst and refused to retract his statements, he was expelled from the party. The same would happen to the rest of Die Jungen in October 1891. Nonetheless, he remained active and even gained influence in the socialist labor movement in Mainz. Although he had already encountered anarchist ideas {{as a result of his}} contacts to Die Jungen in Berlin, his conversion to anarchism did not take place until the International Socialist Congress in Brussels in August 1891. He was heavily disappointed by the discussions at the congress, as it, especially the German delegates, refused to explicitly denounce militarism. He was rather impressed by the Dutch socialist and later anarchist Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, who attacked Liebknecht for his lack of militancy. Rocker got to know Karl Höfer, a German active in smuggling anarchist literature from Belgium to Germany. Höfer gave him Bakunin's God and the State and Kropotkin's Anarchist Morality, two of the most influential anarchist works, as well as the newspaper Autonomie.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Upper Avon Navigation between Stratford and Evesham {{was owned}} by {{relatives}} of Lord Windsor, {{who had died in}} 1758, and its condition gradually deteriorated. Because of the sinuous course of the upper river, it was never really considered as a through navigation, except for a brief period when William James <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> become a through route. He bought all of the shares in the Upper Avon company in 1813, and persuaded the Stratford Canal shareholders {{that there should be a}} junction between their canal and the river at Stratford, which was opened on 24 June 1816. In 1822, he spent £6,000 repairing the locks on the upper river, and became bankrupt. The navigation was taken over by seven men, all connected with the Stratford Canal, who turned Lucy's lock at Stratford into a two-rise staircase lock, constructed three new locks, and improved the river by dredging. Most of the subsequent traffic was local, competing with the Lower Avon for the delivery of coal to Evesham. The Upper Avon was leased to the Stratford Canal from 1842, but there was little traffic, and the lease was not renewed in 1847. The arrival of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway at Stratford sealed its fate, and when the company failed to sell the navigation to local landowners for £150, they effectively abandoned it in 1857. John Broughton, who was the railway manager at Stratford, was persuaded to buy the navigation for £300 by local traders, but the venture was short-lived. Broughton was succeeded, and the railway, now called the West Midland Railway, became part of the Great Western Railway. In 1875, the GWR decided it would no longer maintain the river, and an appeal to the Railway Commissioners in 1877 ruled that they were not obliged to do so.|$|E
500|$|Director Leonard Boyarsky {{considered}} the animation system {{important in the}} team's choice of the Source engine. The integrated [...] "faceposer" [...] tool allowed Troika to customize facial animations, expressions, gestures and lip-synching, eliminating the need to explain what a character was doing. Every non-player character required a voiceover, which helped Troika define its characters more quickly. The engine had a physics system permitting new features, such as monsters hurling corpses at the player or dying characters realistically crumbling into pieces, instead of requiring pre-built animations. Although Troika had ignored first-person engines due to technical limitations, such as a low polygon count and limited texture memory, as the technology improved, it <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> create a real-time action game without sacrificing the immersion and story of a role-playing game.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Video Games Around the World, author Mark J.P. Wolf called the game an [...] "impressive achievement" [...] {{considering}} the developers' young age.

Kristiansson called the decision to create an adventure game in Swedish commendable, and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> help counteract the IBM PC's stigma as not being a computer for average people in Sweden. Sigrid Nurbo at Jönköpings-Posten noted the game's absence from the 2013 video game exhibit at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology as odd considering its popularity and cult status. An eight-week-long video game development camp, named [...] "Stugan" [...] after The Cottages Swedish title, has been held annually in Sweden since 2015.|$|E

Bilheimer said in 2013 that Not My Life [...] "is not a perfect film by any means, but it is having an impact."

500|$|As a {{means of}} augmenting the meagre {{allowance}} provided by her father, Mitford began writing, encouraged by Waugh. Her first efforts, anonymous contributions to gossip columns in society magazines, led to occasional signed articles, and in 1930 The Lady engaged her to write a regular column. That winter, she embarked on a full-length novel, Highland Fling, in which various characters—mostly identifiable among her friends, acquaintances and family—attend a Scottish house-party which develops chaotically. The book made little impact when {{it was published in}} March 1931, and she immediately began work on another, Christmas Pudding. Like the earlier novel, the plot centres on a clash between the [...] "Bright Young People" [...] and the older generation. Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of [...] "Bobby Bobbin", and John Betjeman is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby's tutor. The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale, who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not possibly be published under Mitford's own name.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] {{originated}} {{from a personal}} episode of Al Jean's life; when Jean was in third grade, he received a valentine from a girl that read [...] "I Choo-Choo-Choose You". Years later, Jean wondered if the girl had really liked him. He told writing partner Mike Reiss about it and they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be an idea for an episode where Lisa could give such a valentine to Ralph Wiggum, who would then take it too far. At that time, Ralph and Chief Wiggum were not established as being related. Jean {{thought it would be}} funny if Ralph was Wiggum's son, considering both characters are [...] "fat and dumb". A technique the staff used to come up with stories and ideas was to think [...] "what holiday haven't we done on The Simpsons, or done lately?". As they had done several Halloween and Christmas episodes before, the staff liked the idea of doing a Valentine's Day episode.|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} of superheated steam temperature models of a {{thermal power plant}} under different loads can be approximated to “multimodel” linear uncertain systems. After transformation, the tracking system was obtained from “multimodel” linear uncertain systems.

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the consultation between Kerr, Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and the British Parliament were not part of the discussion. Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen in 1975, Sir William Heseltine, who along with Charteris informed her of the dismissal, has maintained that it came as a surprise to all three of them; that he considered Kerr's actions imprudent; and that he believed that this opinion was shared by Charteris. A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion, and that disillusionment with Kerr's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation. The Queen's opinion is unknown, but Heseltine has stated: [...] "I think she is an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine what she felt, I think she felt the same ... I’m reasonably confident myself that she <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been handled better.” ...|$|E
500|$|Uzumaki was {{influenced}} by the positive representation of spirals in media, which inspired Ito to subvert them to create horror, stating: [...] "Usually spiral patterns mark character's cheeks in Japanese comedy cartoons, representing an effect of warmth. However, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be used in horror if I drew it a different way." [...] The story in which Kirie's hair is cursed by the spiral reflects a recurring theme in Ito's work in which a heroine's hair has a life of its own. Ito uses this imagery because it lends itself well to horror due to its association with the Japanese feminine ideal (Yamato nadeshiko), as well as the unnerving flowing motions of long hair, which he describes as snakelike. Ito also noted that horror writer H. P. Lovecraft was one of his inspirations when creating Uzumaki, stating that the gradual development of the spiral curse was patterned on Lovecraft's storytelling and that [...] " [...] expressionism with regard to atmosphere greatly inspires my creative impulse." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry Goldblatt, {{writing for}} Entertainment Weekly, gave the episode a grade B. He accused {{the show of}} abandoning the [...] "racial {{diversity}} and the gritty poverty" [...] of the film, but still allowed that Peter Berg had [...] "kept the thrust". The Matt Saracen character was singled out as particularly promising. While positively contrasting the show with other teen-age dramas like One Tree Hill, Goldblatt also had doubts about its staying power. Varietys Brian Lowry called the show [...] "Earnest, beautifully shot and perhaps more organically religious {{than anything else in}} primetime". Still, he felt the show was [...] "like one of those family programs middle America and conservatives pine for that too few of them actually bother to watch". He pointed out that the show had to compete with both House and Dancing With the Stars, among women as well as men, in order to survive. The Washington Post critic Tom Shales called the show [...] "Extraordinary in just about every conceivable way," [...] particularly emphasising the quality of the cast. Shales did have issues with the documentary style of show's camera movements, but still <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be the [...] "best new drama series of the season".|$|E

In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because I think it might make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Angels Cry" [...] {{is about}} {{maintaining}} {{hope that a}} fading relationship can be salvaged because true love only happens once. Carey sings [...] "I’m willing to live and die for our love/Baby {{we can get back}} that shine."

He continued, [...] "I love how the guest judge segments of these contest episodes are beginning to become mini-series unto themselves. I hope that tradition continues." [...] James Poniewozik had mixed feelings regarding Griffin's performance. He went on to write, [...] "Glee can be sharp and topical enough that I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> actually do something clever with the much-publicized cameo. Instead, the performance hinged on expected gags [...] and Griffin delivered it all with a stiffness that felt more like a recitation than a performance." [...] Todd VanDerWerff reacted negatively to both performances. In his review of the episode, he opined, [...] "That judges’ scene [...] was a pale retread of the original, only this time, it had Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine, as well as a bunch of tired Tea Party gags that were tired when this episode was written." ...|$|E
