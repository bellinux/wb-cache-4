5|$|A {{signature}} {{feature of}} Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side. Use {{of the barrel}} vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15m (50ft).|$|E

5|$|Although {{he signed}} a new {{contract}} with Southport, Brodie signed for their National League rivals Aldershot Town on 14 August 2015 on a one-year contract. He debuted the following day as a 58th-minute substitute in a 3–0 away defeat to Wrexham, but started the following match, a 1–1 home draw with Dover Athletic, in which he scored Aldershot's equalising goal on 36 minutes from a Jim Stevenson pass. Having scored five goals from 26 appearances, Brodie left Aldershot by mutual consent on 29 January 2016, so he could move closer to home for family reasons. A day later, he joined National League North club Stockport County and played for <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> part-time basis. Brodie scored on his debut with a close-range header in Stockport's 2–1 away defeat to Harrogate Town on 2 February 2016. He scored four goals from 13 appearances as Stockport ranked ninth in the National League North. He was released by the club in May 2016.|$|E

5|$|During a 1910s {{excavation}} for a sewer pipe, {{stones were}} unearthed that were suspected {{to be from}} the old van der Donck estate. During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> busy day. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's {{work has}} {{influenced}} several popular musicians: references to his fiction {{appear in the}} music of Stuart Hamm, Billy Idol, Warren Zevon, Deltron 3030, Straylight Run (whose name is derived from a sequence in Neuromancer) and Sonic Youth. U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced by Neuromancer, and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of Neuromancer above <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No Maps for These Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson.
