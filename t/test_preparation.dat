The next match was against a South African XI, and was {{effectively}} a dress rehearsal for the Tests.

5|$|The tour {{started with}} a match against Worcestershire, with Woodfull scoring a century and Don Bradman making 236* in 275 minutes. Woodfull's first game in command ended with a resounding innings victory. He added 54 in a win over Essex and scored 121 a drawn match against Yorkshire, the {{dominant}} county of the era with many leading Test players. Woodfull then added consecutive fifties in draws against the MCC and Surrey. After consecutive innings wins of Oxford University and Hampshire, Woodfull completed his <b>Test</b> <b>preparation</b> by striking 216 in an innings win over Cambridge University. Heading into the Tests, Woodfull had amassed 662 runs at 66.20. However, concerns over the Australian bowling attack prompted Woodfull and the senior players to ask the board to send another spinner. This was refused.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match against Nottinghamshire, the hosts batted first and made 179. Bradman joined Brown at 1/32 {{and they took}} the score to 197 when Bradman fell for 86. The tourists reached 400 and the hosts ended at 8/299 in the second innings to hang on for a draw. Bradman rested himself for the next fixture against Hampshire, and Australia were dismissed for 117 on a drying pitch in reply to the home side's 195, {{the first time they}} had conceded a first innings lead in the tour. Australia would have been in deeper trouble but for a flurry of sixes by Miller. Hampshire were then bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182, and this time the tourists batted with much more authority to seal an eight-wicket win. The tourists had survived another tight battle under the leadership of Hassett. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Australia skittled the hosts for 86 before Morris and Brown put on an opening stand of 153. Bradman then joined Morris, and gave two early chances. He was dropped on two and escaped a stumping on 25. He and Morris put on 189 before the latter fell for 184. Bradman then ended his <b>Test</b> <b>preparation</b> by reaching 109, in 124 minutes with 12 fours, and declaring at 5/549, before completing another innings victory.|$|E

40|$|Background: p-tert-Butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBP-FR) is {{a common}} {{component}} of glues used in the manufacturing of many plastic, electronic, rubber, wood, and leather products. Two main allergens of PTBP-FR have been described. Objectives: The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the concentrations of the two main allergens of PTBP-FR in diagnostic patch <b>testing</b> <b>preparations</b> and PTBP-FR available to glue and adhesive manufacturers. Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) was used to confirm identity and determine the purity of reference materials. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyse patch <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> and commercially-available PTBP-FR. Results: In the PTBP-FR in analysed patch <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> the highest concentration of the allergenic dimer 4 -tert-butyl- 2 -(5 -tert-butyl- 2 -hydroxy- 3 -hydroxymethyl-benzyloxymethyl) - 6 -hydroxymethylphenol found was 1. 79 % and the lowest 0. 21 %. The highest concentration of the allergenic dimer 4 -tert-butyl- 2 -(5 -tert-butyl- 2 -hydroxy-benzyloxymethyl) - 6 -hydroxymethylphenol found in PTBP-FR of analysed patch <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> was 0. 50 % and the lowest concentration found was 0. 04 %. In commercially-available PTBP-FR the highest concentration of -tert-butyl- 2 -(5 -tert-butyl- 2 -hydroxy- 3 -hydroxymethyl-benzyloxymethyl) - 6 -hydroxymethylphenol found was 3. 7 % and the highest concentration of 4 -tert-butyl- 2 -(5 -tert-butyl- 2 -hydroxy-benzyloxymethyl) - 6 -hydroxymethylphenol found was 1. 1 %. In three PTBP-FR samples neither allergen could be detected. Conclusions: Our data suggests that reporting resin concentration in petrolatum is not predictive of a consistent concentration of the two main allergens of PTBP-FR. The ten-fold difference in allergen concentration between different patch <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> has significant ramifications for maintaining consistent dose of delivered allergen. The results of this study reinforce the need for patch test product standardization in the Contact Dermatitis community...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In an {{outpatient}} population, a high frequency of positive {{skin prick test}} responses to dog dander {{was found in the}} absence of detectable IgE to dog dander in the RAST. The majority of these patients were sensitized to house dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) and had no obvious dog-related allergic symptoms. These findings prompted us to investigate whether dog dander skin <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> are contaminated with house dust mite allergens in amounts sufficient to cause false-positive skin prick test responses in patients sensitized to house dust mites. METHODS: Antigen detection assays with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used to determine concentrations of the major allergen Can f 1 from dog dander and the major allergens Der p 1 and Der p 2 from house dust mites in five commercially available dog dander skin prick <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> (A to E). RESULTS: Can f 1 concentrations varied for the different extracts (A: 170 micrograms/ml, B: 11. 1 micrograms/ml, C: 13. 3 micrograms/ml, D: 3. 8 micrograms/ml, and E: 59. 4 micrograms/ml). Der p 1 was detectable in all extracts (A: 33. 4 ng/ml, B: 5. 1 ng/ml, C: 29. 6 ng/ml, D: 0. 4 ng/ml, and E: 1. 9 ng/ml), and Der p 2 was detectable in some of the commercially available dog dander skin prick <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> <b>tested</b> (A: 31. 3 ng/ml, B: 3. 0 ng/ml, and C: 7. 5 ng/ml). The median house dust mite threshold in the skin prick test was found to be 5. 8 ng/ml, of Der p 1 (range, 3. 5 to 20. 8 ng/ml) in nine patients tested. CONCLUSION: Contamination of commercially available dog dander skin prick <b>test</b> <b>preparations</b> with the major allergens (Der p 1 and Der p 2) of the house dust mite (D. pteronyssinus) was demonstrated. These contaminations cause false-positive responses to skin prick tests with dog dander in patients sensitized to house dust mit...|$|R
