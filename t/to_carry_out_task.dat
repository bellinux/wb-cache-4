The study explores the main components that should comprise an integrated human resource management system, highlighting their relationships, the decision tools that can be put into practice and the levels of analysis that must be conducted. This paper presents an innovative multi-agent architecture of decision support system. The multi-agent system {{is divided into three}} layers: the strategic management layer, the tactical management and the operational management layer. The multi-agent layer has its own knowledge base that comprises all the data and know-how <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>task</b> and to handle interaction with the other agents and its environment. Lastly, the theory of typical system management, the method of information collecting and knowledge discovery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As for {{the problem}} of how <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>task</b> {{scheduling}} and data replication effectively in the grid and to reduce task’s execution time, this thesis proposes the task scheduling algorithm and the optimum dynamic data replication algorithm and builds a scheme to effectively combine these two algorithms. First of all, the scheme adopts the ISS algorithm considering the number of tasks waiting queue, the location of task demand data and calculation capacity of site by adopting the method of network structure’s hierarchical scheduling to calculate the cost of comprehensive task with the proper weight efficiency and search out the best compute node area. And then the algorithm of ODHRA is adopted to analyze the data transmission time, memory access latency, waiting copy requests in the queue and the distance between nodes, choose out the best replications location in many copies combined with copy placement and copy management to reduce the file access time. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme compared with other algorithm has better performance in terms of average task execution time...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} realisation that edge devices, which {{are closer to}} a user, {{can play an important}} part in supporting latency and privacy sensitive applications. Such devices have also continued to increase in capability over recent years, ranging in complexity from embedded resources (e. g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino boards) placed alongside data capture devices to more complex “micro data centres”. Using such resources, a user is able <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>task</b> execution and data storage in proximity to their location, often making use of computing resources that can have varying ownership and access rights. Increasing performance requirements for stream processing applications (for instance), which incur delays between the client and the cloud have led to newer models of computation, which requires an application workflow to be split across data centre and edge resource capabilities. With recent emergence of edge/fog computing it has become possible to migrate services to micro-data centres and to address the performance limitations of traditional (centralised data centre) cloud based applications. Such migration can be represented as a cost function that involves incentives for micro-data centres to host services with associated quality of services and experience. Business models need to be developed for creating an open edge cloud environment where micro-data centres have the right incentives to support service hosting, and for large scale data centre operators to outsource service execution to such micro data centres. We describe potential revenue models for micro-data centers to support service migration and serve incoming requests for edge based applications. We present several cost models which involve combined use of edge devices and centralised data centres...|$|E

In contrast, time-based prospective memory occurs when you remember <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> a <b>task</b> at a specific time. [...] An example of this is remembering to phone your sister on her birthday.
