5|$|In 1754, {{a stretch}} of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed {{passengers}} for <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. <b>The</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of market gardening, and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, {{the first step in}} the development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.|$|E

40|$|Previous reports using various {{protein kinase}} inhibitors have {{suggested}} that protein kinase activity is necessary for both <b>the</b> induction and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular phenomenon likely to contribute to mammalian memory formation.

As the effect cannot {{be accounted for by}} either of two well-known mechanisms for persistent PKC activation, membrane insertion, or proteolysis, the persistent activation <b>of</b> PKC in <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> phase <b>of</b> LTP appears to occur via another mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>maintenance</b> phase <b>of</b> LTP is associated with decreased immunoreactivity of PKC, an effect that can be reversed with phosphatase treatment.
