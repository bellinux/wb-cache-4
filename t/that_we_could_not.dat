25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in it <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> infer from Tibullus himself and from what Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. It is another moot question of some importance whether our poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia. Porphyrio's view was examined by Postgate (Selections from Tibullus, appendix A).|$|E

If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it."

2500|$|In December 1989, the Bible Broadcasting Network {{terminated}} MacArthur's Grace to You program. In {{explaining that}} step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings {{on the blood}} of Christ, and [...] "Lordship Salvation."

[...] In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a, [...] "....drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> adhere to," [...] and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election [...] "....convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism...." [...] MacArthur preaches [...] "Salvation" [...] by election of God's sovereignty. However, the term [...] "Hyper-Calvinism" [...] is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical [...] "Hyper-Calvinism" [...] position that only the [...] "Elect" [...] may be offered the Gospel (compare with the historical teaching of all Protestant denominations, including MacArthur, of the free offer of the gospel). This position {{does not seem to}} accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of the Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement {{that it is not the}} literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on The Cross, a view that he espoused in an article titled, [...] "Not His Bleeding, but His Dying," [...] published in the May 1976 issue of the Grace to You family paper that is distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.|$|E

[...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west.

2500|$|In later years, Lake became {{increasingly}} involved in archeological expeditions. [...] He had remarkable abilities as an organizer and an uncanny skill {{in finding the}} necessary money to fund his various undertakings. [...] In the spring of 1927, with Robert P.

Gardiner who suggested that on their return they might stop by Serabit el-Khadim, {{which was in the}} neighborhood of the monastery, and attempt to locate a number of previously noticed inscriptions in a Proto-Sinaitic script. [...] As Lake remarked in his account of the adventure: [...] "It should be noted that 'in the neighborhood' is a relative matter, for, stated in terms of time instead of space, the monastery was about as far from Serabit as New York is from San Francisco." [...] After a week's journey on camels they were able to locate the site and the inscriptions, as well as identify two additional inscriptions not previously known. [...] "It is a pity <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> identify the fragments more accurately," [...] Lake noted, [...] "but the temperature in the shade was over 115° Fahr., and the fragments were in the sun and almost too hot to touch" [...] (HTR 21 : 3-4, 5). [...] Lake would return to further investigate the site, as well as the adjacent temple of Hathor in 1930 on an expedition led by him and Blake, this time accompanied by Silva (his future second wife), at the time a Guggenheim fellow, who would handle the photography. [...] In the results of the expedition that were published in 1932, Lake described the camp: [...] "It was not exactly luxurious, and on two days when in rained it was extremely uncomfortable, as we had to spend the whole time in the cave, in which it was impossible to stand upright except in a few spots. [...] The cooking was shared by Professor Blake and Mrs. [...] New, and consisted chiefly of rice, with canned meat dissolved in tomato-sauce and curry-powder" [...] (HTR 25 : 98-99). [...] A final trip was made in 1935; unfortunately, this time Lake was injured during the trip. [...] He received internal injuries when bumped by a camel, but continued the journey, and was carried by litter {{to the top of the}} mountain. [...] After supervising the start of the excavation, his condition worsened and he was rushed to Jerusalem with his wife to receive medical attention. [...] In 1929, Lake approached John Winter Crowfoot of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ) about a joint excavation with some other institutions of Samaria, to complete the earlier work of Harvard's George A. Reisner. [...] The new dig began in 1931 and Lake was there for four seasons (1931–34), accompanied again by Silva and Blake. [...] The joint team also included Eleazar Sukenik from Hebrew University and Kathleen Kenyon from the BSAJ. [...] The excavation would yield many important results. [...] As for accommodations in the camp, Kenyon reports that [...] "although they had a hotel-trained Egyptian cook and Palestinian servants to do the washing, the expedition staff lived in tents, sleeping on camp beds" [...] and [...] "the social life of the dig consisted of having cocktails at the end of the day, playing bridge after dinner, and in 1933, listening to jazz records." [...] In 1938–39, Lake along with Silva and Robert P. Casey from Brown University were allowed to conduct a small excavation of Van Fortress in Turkish Armenia. [...] For 15 years he had been seeking permission from the Turkish government to make the expedition. [...] He told the press that until 1937, [...] "the savage tribes of Turkish Armenia, the Kurds, have not been sufficiently pacified for the government to recommend the trip."
