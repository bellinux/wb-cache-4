5000|$|This type of {{surveying}} {{method is}} called a towboard survey, towed-diver survey, and the manta tow technique, the latter named after the Manta Board, an oval towboard marketed for recreational use. A variant is the SAM or [...] "Single-armed Manta-board". This consists of a small board with a strap to secure and tow the diver by the forearm. This frees the other arm, allowing the diver to take notes on a pad held by the <b>towing</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
40|$|Different {{manufacturing}} methods of cellular metals {{will be presented}} {{and some of them}} will be amplified. Furthermore material properties and different applications will be illustrated. As a result of the properties metal foam is useful for the construction of front opening hoods of commuter trains and high speed trains. The results of a large research project with a real demonstrator will be shown. A 5 m long front cab made from aluminium foam sandwiches will shown and the way to design and build this railway application Another field of application is the mining. In a research projects are developed Hybrid-towing arm from in conveyor technology for coil mining. The <b>towing</b> <b>arm</b> was 27 % lighter than the original one. The largest problem was to test the towning arms under real conditions. The test was now done and is passed succesfull. It was shown that such aluminium foams, especially as a sandwich, fulfil all technical requests in many branches. It is also described how metal foams are being used in serial application in the mechanical engineering...|$|E
5000|$|The free {{floating}} screed has become standard {{because of the}} smoothing or averaging effect it can have on the existing base course. Since the only connection between the asphalt paver and the screed is the <b>tow</b> <b>arm,</b> the screed can [...] "float" [...] vertically relative to the paver. This allows the paver to traverse uneven ground while the screed floats over the material {{placed in front of}} it.|$|R

2500|$|The {{system is}} known to have four {{standard}} A variants, the M28/A1-A3. However, the actual specifics between variants is vague. From the available information suggests that specific variants were mated to specific iterations of the AH-1 helicopter. The initial XM28/M28 were fitted to the AH-1G, as were the M28E1/M28A1. The M28A1E1/M28A2 was fitted to the AH-1Q, while the M28A3 (no developmental variation known) was fitted to the AH-1P/S helicopter. [...] There is the possibility that the M28A2 could have been the first unit designed to work with the XM128/M128 Helmet Sight System (HSS) developed primarily for use with <b>TOW</b> <b>armed</b> AH-1s.|$|R

5000|$|Sop's Arm is a {{settlement}} in Newfoundland and Labrador. The community was formed in the 1930s and 1940s by families moving from surrounding communities, including Jackson's Arm. In the 1950s and 1960s families from nearby Sop's Island moved to Sop's <b>Arm,</b> <b>towing</b> their houses across the channel of water.|$|R
50|$|Santa Gertrudis a frigate of 40-guns, {{was armed}} only with fourteen, and was sailing from Peru and Mexico to Coruna when Polyphemus {{captured}} her. Polyphemus and Santa Gertrudis separated in a gale that damaged the Spanish ship, which nonetheless reached Plymouth on 10 January 1805, in <b>tow</b> by the <b>armed</b> defence ship Harriet, which had encountered Santa Gertrudis some {{days after the}} gale.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 November, INS Tabar was on patrol 285 nmi km {{southwest}} of Salalah, Oman (near [...] ), when it spotted the hijacked trawler. The vessel was identified by the frigate as a pirate mother ship, as it had two speed boats in <b>tow</b> and men <b>armed</b> with rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) and assault rifles on its deck. The frigate ordered the trawler to be boarded for inspection. Upon being refused and threatened by the pirates, the frigate continued to follow the trawler.|$|R
50|$|By {{leaning back}} {{and keeping the}} legs {{slightly}} bent, the skis will eventually plane out and the skier will start to glide over the water. The skier turns by shifting weight left or right. The skier's body weight should be balanced between the balls of the feet and the heels. While being <b>towed,</b> the skier's <b>arms</b> should be relaxed but still fully extended so as to reduce stress on the arms. The handle can be held vertically or horizontally, depending on whichever position is more comfortable for the skier.|$|R
50|$|Nelson was {{appointed}} to the command of the inner squadron blockading Cadiz. An order from Sir John Jervis directed the launches and barges of two divisions of the fleet to assemble on board , between 9 and 10 o'clock every night, armed with carronades, spikes, cutlasses, broad axes, and chopping knives, a lamp in each boat with spikes, a sledge-hammer, and a coil of small rope, to <b>tow</b> off any <b>armed</b> brig, mortar or gun-boat, that should be carrier, and to follow the directions of Nelson for the night.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{days later}} Polyphemus and [...] {{captured}} the Spanish frigate Santa Gertruyda off Cape St Mary. A frigate of 40-guns, she was armed only with 14, and was sailing from Peru and Mexico to Coruna when Polyphemus captured her. Polyphemus and Santa Gertruyda separated in a gale that damaged the Spanish ship, which nonetheless reached Plymouth on 10 January 1805, in <b>tow</b> by the <b>armed</b> defence ship Harriet, which had encountered Santa Gertruyda some {{days after the}} gale. Santa Gertruyda was carrying $1,215,000, and merchandize. Once she arrived in Plymouth, the Royal Navy took her into service as , but did not commission the 40-year-old ship. Instead she served as a receiving ship.|$|R
25|$|Desmoulea {{remained}} at Suda Bay for several weeks, {{down on the}} sandy bottom by the stern, with its after well deck awash; the cargo {{was transferred to the}} tanker Eocene. Along with the torpedo attack on the cargo ship Clan Cumming by the Italian submarine Neghelli on 19 January, this was the only Italian success against British convoys in the Aegean Sea. After the action, Allied shipping made passage into the Aegean through the Antikithera Strait. Desmoulea was finally taken in <b>tow</b> by the <b>armed</b> boarding vessel HMS Chakla and escorted to Port Said by the anti-submarine trawlers HMS Lydiard and HMS Amber. The ship arrived on 6 May and moored off the western beacon of Suez, for use as a temporary storage vessel. It was torpedoed again on 3 August 1941, while awaiting repairs, by German bombers. Desmoulea was towed to Bombay, India and ran aground twice during the passage. Desmoulea was converted into a store ship, named Empire Thane and remained in port at Cochin until 1947, from where it was towed back to the United Kingdom. It was rebuilt under its original name in 1949, before being laid up in 1955 and scrapped in 1961.|$|R
