40|$|ABSTRACT: In some years, {{large numbers}} of Caligus chiastos have been {{observed}} on the external surfaces of southern bluefin tuna, particularly {{on the head and}} eyes, in some sea cages in Spencer Gulf, Australia. As no epidemiological data were available, we monitored sea lice on <b>tuna</b> (<b>N</b> = 130) in 4 research cages sampled at 6 wk intervals during the 2005 farming season. No lice were observed on a sample of 10 wild-caught tuna when the cohort was transferred to cages in early April. By late May more than half the sampled tuna (22 of 40) were infected, with up to 42 parasites; we also recorded one unidentified Caligus sp. at this time. In early July the number of tuna infected with lice declined to 10...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{dynamics}} of tuna {{have been investigated}} by recording blood pressures and flows in the central circulation of both anaesthetised and swimming individuals. In anaesthetised fish (N= 5), heart rate averaged 112 ± 21 b e a t sm i n 21 (mean ± S. E.) and stroke volume was 0. 67 ± 0. 24 m lk g 21 when normoxic water flowed over the gills. Ventricular diastolic pressure was zero until atrial contraction filled the ventricle. Ventral aortic pressures were high (mean 12. 08 ± 1. 15 kPa), and blood flow was continuous in the ventral aorta throughout diastole. Dorsal aortic pressure (mean 6. 3 ± 1. 28 kPa; N= 4) and flow were both pulsatile. Pressure pulsatility (pulse pressure {{as a proportion of}} mean pressure) was about one-quarter of flow pulsatility, indicating considerable compliance in the dorsal aortic circulation. Total peripheral resistance averaged 0. 17 ± 0. 4 k P am l 21 k g 21 m i n 21 o f which gill resistance averaged 48 ± 15 % (N= 4). For the ventral aorta, impedance modulus fell markedly from the mean value and then declined more gradually towards zero with increasing harmonic frequencies. Impedance phase was negative (20. 8 to 21. 1 r a d) meaning that flow leads pressure at all harmonics.

40|$|December 13 - 14, 2006 Siam City Hotel, Bangkok, ThailandWe {{conducted}} shallow-set {{longline fishing}} operations on a research vessel {{in the western}} North Pacific, May-July, 2002 - 2004. We investigated sea turtle interaction with a pelagic longline fishery and preliminarily examined the potential gear modifications (bait and hook types) for reducing sea turtle bycatch or mortality. A total of 54 loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta were caught in 76 operations (about 74, 000 hooks), which were all alive. The mean straight carapace length was 67 cm (range: 52 - 82 cm); this suggested most of loggerhead sea turtles caught in this area were sub-adult. Loggerhead sea turtle catches ranged from 19. 1 to 24. 5 °C in sea surface temperature, which were concentrated in warm water masses in the Kuroshio extension. The Loggerhead sea turtle catch was more frequently observed on hooks hauled after sunrise. For bait type, the catches by mackerel bait were fewer than those by squid bait. In the circle hook trial in 2003, the deep-hooking rates (proportion of deep-hooking (at esophagus or pharynx) to total in numbers) on squid bait were 0. 41 and 0. 23 in 3. 8 sun conventional <b>tuna</b> hook (<b>n</b> = 22) and 3. 8 sun Tankichi type circle hook (which had similar size to 3. 8 sun conventional <b>tuna</b> hook) (<b>n</b> = 13), respectively, but {{the difference was not}} significant (P > 0. 05, extended Fisher’s exact test). In 2004 the large 18 / 0 circle hooks (which had a larger size, compared to 3. 8 sun tuna hook) were tested, but its effect was not clarified due to very small catch numbers. Following these researches, we have been conducting sea turtle mitigation studies, with evaluation of their impacts on target and other non-target species catches...|$|R

40|$|We {{combined}} longitudinal {{analyses of}} otolith microstructure and trace elemental composition in ~ age 1 - 2 Pacific bluefin <b>tuna</b> (PBT, <b>n</b> = 24) for inferring {{the arrival of}} individuals in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME). Element:Ca ratios in transverse otolith sections (9 - 12 rows, triplicate ablations from coreprimordium to edge, ø 50 µm) were quantified for eight elements: Li, Mg, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, and Ba, which was followed by microstructure analysis to provide age estimates corresponding to each ablation spot. Age estimates from otoliths ranged from 328 to 498 days post hatch. The combined elemental signatures of four elements (Ba, Mg, Co, Cu) showed a significant increase at the otolith edge in {{approximately half of the}} individuals (30 - 60 days prior to catch). Given the different oceanographic properties of oligotrophic open Pacific vs. high nutrient, upwelling CCLME waters, this signal is consistent with the entry of the fish into the CCLME, which was estimated to occur primarily in July after a transoceanic migration of ~ 1. 5 - 2. 0 months...|$|R

40|$|Temperature-depth {{recorders}} (TDRs) {{were attached}} to pelagic longline gear in the Hawaii-based commercial fishery to obtain actual fishing depths and to test the accuracy of catenary algorithms for predicting fishing depths. Swordfish gear was set shallow by typically deploying four hooks between successive floats. The observed depth of the settled deepest hook had a median value of 60 m for 333 swordfish sets. Tuna longline gear deployed more hooks between floats (mean = 26. 8), and the observed median depth of the deepest hook was 248 m (n = 266 sets). Maximum gear depth was predicted from estimates of the longline sag ratio and catenary algorithms; however, depth was not predicted for all TDR-monitored sets because estimating sag ratios proved problematic. Swordfish sets had less slack in the main line and correspondingly smaller catenary angles (median = 54. 2 ◦) than tuna sets (median = 63. 7 ◦). Median values of the predicted catenary depth were 123 m for swordfish sets (n = 203) and 307 m for <b>tuna</b> sets (<b>n</b> = 198). Shallow swordfish sets reached only ∼ 50 % of their predicted depth, while deeper tuna sets reached about 70 %. These values indicated that capture depths using traditional catenary equations may be biased {{without the benefit of}} TDRs affixed to longlines. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed to explain the percentage of longline shoaling as a function of predicted catenary depth and environmental effects of wind stress, surface current velocity, and current shear. The GAM explained 67. 2 % of the deviance in shoaling for tuna sets and 41. 3 % for swordfish sets. Predicted catenary depth was always the initial variable included in the stepwise process, and the inclusion of environmental information in the GAM approac...|$|R

There is growing concern over the effects of tuna sea-cages on the local sediment chemistry and benthic communities. Eighteen stations were sampled with a Van Veen grab (0. 1 m 2) from the oceanographic vessel Francisco de Ulloa in March 2003 and October 2004. Redox potential in 2003 ranged between- 113 and- 200 mV, while in 2004 it ranged between- 110 and- 302 mV. Organic carbon concentrations varied between 0. 20 % and 2. 53 %, lowest values were located {{in the southern part}} of the bay; highest concentrations were found at stations 18 – 22 situated in the northern section, west of the <b>tuna</b> pens. Organic <b>N</b> varied between 0. 02 % and 0. 12 %, highest concentrations (0. 07 – 0. 12 %) were located at stations 16 – 21 in the northern section of the bay; stations situated at the south and near the coast presented the lowest N concentrations (0. 02 – 0. 04 %). A total of 9, 291 organisms belonging to seven phyla were collected: Polychaeta, Mollusca, Crustacea, Echinodermata, Cnidaria, Sipuncula, and Bryozoa. Polychaetes accounted for 62 % of all invertebrate macrofauna, with 5, 765 specimens representing 34 families and 146 species. The best represented families in 2003 and 2004 were Paraonidae, Cirratulidae, Spionidae, Capitellidae, Syllidae, Nephtyidae, Lumbrineridae, and Glyceridae. Polychaetes were dominant at almost all sampling stations. Families with the highest species richness wer...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change has}} been {{predicted}} to have large and rapid impacts on the Mediterranean Sea. Impacts of increasing mean annual sea temperatures, more extreme climatic events and changes in oceanographic parameters will a ffect the distribution, productivity and resilience of commercially targeted stocks. This study uses data on the Maltese fi shing industry, collected through the EU fi sheries data collection system by the Government of Malta, to develop {{our understanding of how}} climate change may impact the Maltese fi sheries sector. The most important fleet segment contributing to the overall productivity of the Maltese fishing industry, both in terms of total biomass landed and total generated income, was comprised of vessels using hooks in 2009 - 2011. These vessels mainly used drifting surface longlines to target large pelagic species. In 2011, this fleet segment accounted for the largest number of full time employment positions, and was the most important fleet segment in terms of total investment. Available information on species targeted by this fleet segment suggests that the impact of climate change may in fact be positive. However, limited information is available on stock status {{as well as on the}} potential impacts of climate change on several important target species such as sword sh, dolphin sh and blue <b>n</b> <b>tuna.</b> In order to ensure the continued competitiveness of the Maltese fishing fleet in light of this uncertain situation, it is suggested that an emphasis is placed on ensuring that the industry is flexible and able to eff ectively market and promote new products as and when they emerge. This could be achieved by developing fi shers' skills accordingly, and placing an emphasis on diversifying activities. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comIntroduction: Dietary fish oil is thought to reduce sudden cardiac death by suppressing ventricular arrhythmias but {{little is known about}} its impact on atrial arrhythmias. We examined the effect of dietary fish oil on the rabbit model of stretch-induced vulnerability to atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods and Results: Six-week-old rabbits were fed standard rabbit pellets supplemented with 5 % <b>tuna</b> fish oil (<b>n</b> = 6) or supplemented with 5 % sunflower oil (n = 6) for 12 weeks. Six rabbits raised on the standard diet were used as controls. In Langendorff-perfused hearts intraatrial pressures were increased in a stepwise manner and rapid burst pacing applied to induce AF at increasing intraatrial pressures until AF was sustained (> 1 minute). Atrial refractory periods were recorded at each pressure. Increased atrial pressure resulted in a reduction in atrial refractory period and a propensity for induction of sustained AF. Higher pressures were needed to induce and sustain AF in the fish oil group compared with the sunflower oil and control groups. The stretch-induced drop in refractory period was also less marked in the fish oil group. Red blood cell, atrial, and ventricular omega- 3 fatty acid levels were significantly higher in the fish oil group. The ratio of atrial n- 6 /n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was 13 ± 0. 9 with sunflower oil and 1. 5 ± 0. 01 with fish oil (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Incorporation of dietary omega- 3 fatty acids into atrial tissue reduces stretch-induced susceptibility to AF. Daniel M. Ninio, Karen J. Murphy, Peter R. Howe, and David A. Sain...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this note, {{we present}} an {{approach}} {{which has been}} recently used to execute online the set of codes used for eastern blue <b>n</b> <b>tuna</b> (BFT-E) stock assessment at ICCAT. We aim at discussing the possible interest of the approach to the IOTC Community for focusing on Indian ocean tuna and tuna-like stocks and running other assesment models such as Stock Synthesis 3 (SS 3). In 2014, ICCAT BFT-E working group {{has been able to}} execute thousands of model runs by using parallelization of R and Fortran codes on a supercomputer. This approach has a lot of scienti c bene ts, in particular for better including the multiple sources of uncer- tainty in assessment results and associated scienti c advice. However, very few participants would be able to reproduce it without speci c technical skills. Since November 2015, a WebSite or VRE for Virtual Research En- vironment has been set up within the H 2020 BlueBridge project to enable users to easily parametrize and execute various steps of the BFT-E stock assessment work ow. By repackaging codes provided by ICCAT BFT-E working group, the same codes are now executable online. They can be parametrized, executed and edited by anybody from a simple web page and data outputs are delivered in standard data format. At this stage, this VRE comes with various collaborative Web Services: (i) a workspace to share documents or data, (ii) Web pages or RStudio server to process data online, and (iii) an automated report service to dynamically generate documents packaging these results. Such a collaborative environment enables to store and access the whole set of data and source codes to replicate past results or to try new parametrizations of the model with usual tools or simple web forms. Such an approach might bring more transparency and collaboration within working groups...|$|R
