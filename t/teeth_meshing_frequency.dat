40|$|In wind {{turbines}} the drive train, especially the gear box, {{is a significant}} source of noise. One reason is the <b>tooth</b> <b>mesh</b> of the gear wheels. The structure born noise generated by the <b>tooth</b> <b>mesh</b> propagates through the roller bearings to the gearbox and through the impact noise insulation to the nacelle bedplate and finally to the tower. The large surface area of the tower radiates the noise to the environment. The impact noise insulation is often insufficient. Single tones in the noise are especially problematic, since pure tone penalty to the maximum emission values is required by law if single tone components are in the noise spectrum. Most gearboxes consist of a planetary and a one or two-stage spur gear stage. Typical <b>tooth</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>frequencies</b> are 100 Hz and 600 Hz (tones in the noise). The Active Vibration Absorber (AVA) introduced in this paper based on Piezo Stack Actuators and allows active compensation of tonal components induced by the gear. It works with two commercial Piezo Stack Actuators in-phase opposition. They provide also the stiffness of the vibration absorber. Since {{wind turbines}} work with variable speed, adaptation in frequency is necessary. Depending on the special case different control laws could be chosen. If frequency is adapted by a variable position feedback of the actuator stroke the control law changes the effective stiffness of the system. The result is a tunable vibration absorber. Additionally, damping or increasing of the effective mass can be realized by the controller. Inferentially, the absorber works as an active system. Introduction Single tone components in noise Wind turbines have a rising share in energy supply and contribute to climate protection and saving of resources. With an ever increasing number of wind turbines also in densely populated areas the sound emissions are not be disregarded. There are two main sound sources: the rotor blades and the drive train. Over the past years the aerodynamic noise induced by the rotor blades could successfully be reduced. Now, the focus lies on the sound generated by the drive train, especially by the gear box inside. A significant sound source is the <b>tooth</b> <b>mesh</b> of the gear wheels [1]. Most gearboxes consist of a planetary and a one or two-stage spur gear stage [1]. Typical <b>tooth</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>frequencies</b> are in the range of 100 Hz to 600 Hz (tones in the noise).

In the present work it is shown that the vibration signal analysis can be effectively used for diagnosing the lubrication condition of gears. The spectral and statistical analysis of the gear vibration acceleration are investigated. Spectral analysis indicates that the deterioration in lubrication condition causes for overall increase in the amplitude of acceleration, but the relative increase in the amplitudes of higher harmonics of <b>tooth</b> <b>meshing</b> <b>frequencies</b> indicate the condition of lubrication. Difficulties in spectral analysis are also mentioned. In statistical analysis the probability density functions of the recorded time histories, along with their normal approximations are used.

40|$|Abstract. Modern high {{performance}} transmissions in fabrication and energy industries {{more and more}} have to satisfy high requirements concerning their nominal load, running properties and operational stability. Helical gears with small modules are usually used to meet these demands. To assure an undisturbed operation, to avoid unplanned downtimes and consequential damages of {{high performance}} transmissions a condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is useful. The running properties, rate of wear {{and the development of}} damages of precision forged and conventional helical gear wheels are analyzed at the IW in a special transmission test bench. The condition monitoring of the test bench is done by vibration and acoustic emission measurements which allow the actual description of the running properties and the development of damages. For the early detection of damages like pitting or cracks at the tooth root, analysis techniques in time and frequency domain and the wavelet analysis have been adapted. Because of the higher resolution in the time domain the wavelet analysis is more suitable for the analysis of frequency components caused by very short excitations, like the beginning of pitting and the propagation of cracks, than the Fast Fourier Transformation. Characteristic values in time and frequency domain (statistical time values, <b>teeth</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>frequencies,</b> cepstral values) are used {{for the development of a}} vector analysis to classify different faults. These characteristic values build up a multidimensional vector of the actual running condition which is compared to the vector of the reference condition. This analysis method allows a very early fault diagnosis and an estimation of the operational time remaining. The detection of cracks in the teeth of gear wheels by vibration analysis is possible with a quite small forecast lead time only. Therefore an eddy current probe has been developed which is located directly at the gear wheel. It can detect volumetric faults like the beginning of pitting or crack initiations in a very early stage during operation...|$|R
40|$|Vibration signals {{measured}} from a gearbox are complex multicomponent signals, generated by <b>tooth</b> <b>meshing,</b> gear shaft rotation, gearbox resonance vibration signatures, and {{a substantial amount}} of noise. This paper presents a novel scheme for extracting gearbox fault features using adaptive filtering techniques for enhancing condition features, <b>meshing</b> <b>frequency</b> sidebands. A modified least mean square (LMS) algorithm is examined and validated using only one accelerometer, instead of using two accelerometers in traditional arrangement, as the main signal and a desired signal is artificially generated from the measured shaft speed and gear <b>meshing</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The proposed scheme is applied to a signal simulated from gearbox frequencies with a numerous values of step size. Findings confirm that 10 âˆ’ 5 step size invariably produces more accurate results {{and there has been a}} substantial improvement in signal clarity (better signal-to-noise ratio), which makes <b>meshing</b> <b>frequency</b> sidebands more discernible. The developed scheme is validated via a number of experiments carried out using two-stage helical gearbox for a healthy pair of gears and a pair suffering from a tooth breakage with severity fault 1 (25 % tooth removal) and fault 2 (50 % tooth removal) under loads (0 %, and 80 % of the total load).

An 8 -DOF (degree-of-freedom) model is developed to include the effect of not only gear dynamics but also supporting bearings, a driving motor and a loading system.

The latter causes additional vibration responses {{in the direction of the}} off-line-of-action (OLOA). To show the quantitative effect of the friction, vibration responses are simulated under different friction coefficients. It shows that an increase in friction coefficient value causes a nearly linear increase in the vibration features. However, features from torsional responses and the principal responses in the line-of-action (LOA) show less changes in the vibration level, whereas the most significant increasing is in the OLOA direction. In addition, the second and third harmonics of the <b>meshing</b> <b>frequency</b> are more influenced than the first harmonic component for all motions.

For the simulation of changes of velocities disk of various diameters with controlled tangential velocities are applied, and this enables a broad range of combinations of sliding velocity and rolling velocity. High and variable values of contact pressures that appear in real gear pairs are realized by the combination of variable values of normal load and dimensions (diameter and width) of the disks. Friction coefficient is used as the indicator of friction magnitude.

It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of internal gear pairs with precise tooth profile, then determines the number of multi-tooth <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the number of <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs. In the range of tooth number of internal gear equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth number difference equal to 1 the number of effective <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth number difference equal to 5 the number of effective <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the number of <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs are tooth number and tooth number difference. The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth number difference is, the fewer the number of <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth number difference is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease {{of the number of}} <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs. Within the normal value scope of modification coefficient difference of involute internal gear pairs with small tooth number difference, the influence of modification coefficient difference and modification coefficient is very small. When the torque increases, the number of effective contacting teech pairs will keep unchanged.

The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline.

Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|R

Among the many applications where plastic gears are used, one is where any form of lubrication must be avoided, such as in ofÂ®ce printing and food-processing equipment, but dry running can lead to high friction and associated high temperatures. As more is understood about plastic gears, the trend is towards high-power applications where inefÂ®ciencies become even more important. As high temperatures must be avoided with plastics, knowledge of efÂ®ciencies and friction is essential in the rating of plastic gears. This paper looks at the efÂ®ciencies of plastic spur gears made from a range of polymers and polymer composites used in plastic gear manufacture.
