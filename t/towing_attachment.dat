By the time his son, Geoff, took over the business, there were five vehicles; a Chevrolet, two Fords and two SB Bedfords {{ranging in age from}} seven to eleven years. In the 1970s the fleet primarily consisted of Denning bodied Mercedes-Benz O302s and later Denning Denairs. In 1978, Ansair bodied Mercedes-Benz O303 42 seaters were purchased; fully equipped with air conditioning, hydraulic tilt seats, a chemical toilet and trailer <b>towing</b> <b>attachment.</b> The livery was originally white with red stripes being modified in the mid-1990s with dark blue and orange added.

40|$|Dakota K. J. 874 was {{delivered}} {{as a standard}} R. A. F Mark IV paratrooping aircraft. The undermentioned modifications were called for in order, to convert it to an aircraft suitable for the carrying out of flight tests & development on the Type "D" Auto Pilot", bearing in mind the lessons learned from previous operations of a Valetta on similar work. The requirement that the aircraft {{be placed in a}} civil category for maintenance entailed the conversion being carried out by a Firm approved by the Air Registration Board for overhaul and maintenance, including Radio, also approved for Design. After discussion, the contract was placed with the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, whose maintenance and design organization is fully A. R. B. approved, the aircraft being delivered during February, 1953. The first requirement was the removal of all surplus equipment from the airframe. This included all the paratrooping gear, the seating, which was unsuitable since it ran the full length of the fuselage facing towards the centre gangway, the glider <b>towing</b> <b>attachment</b> in the tail cone, the Behdix W. T. radio gear and the A. 3 Auto Pilot. The Bendix Radio was not wanted because it was too bulky and would not be used in connection with Type "D" trials, and it was also intended to operate the Dakota without a wireless operator.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} of bolted 6061-T6 aluminium, {{with the two}} seats mounted on a fuselage boom tube that runs from the front rudder pedals to the tail. The landing gear consists of two main wheels on chrome molybdenum steel gear legs and axles, and a tail wheel configuration. The flexible steel axles work as shock absorbers during taxiing and landing. The tail wheel is steerable {{by means of the}} rudder pedals. The standard Rotax 582 engine is mounted in pusher configuration behind the wing's trailing edge. The engine's liquid-cooling allows fast descents while towing, without subjecting the engine cylinders to shock-cooling. The wing is supported by a V-strut and jury struts. The wing and tail surfaces are covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. A unique feature is the extended rudder post, which is supported by steel cables from the wings and used as a <b>tow</b> <b>attachment</b> point. The aircraft is equipped with dual controls for pilot training and the rear seat is removable when not needed. The aircraft takes about 200 hours to assemble from the kit.|$|R
2500|$|The {{battalion}} Medical Officer and the ambulances {{had been}} left behind at the start line on 26 October, since when they had been unable to move forward in daylight and the loss of the FOO during the night, made it impossible to direct plunging fire on the Axis artillery and tanks hidden in dips around the post. Much of the British artillery-fire fell around the outpost instead, until the 2nd Rifle Brigade managed to stop the guns at [...] The outpost was also running short of ammunition so three carriers were loaded with the most badly wounded men, dashed for the ridge to the east and reached safety. The battalion ambulances and supply lorries were behind the ridge ready to move, along with a replacement FOO but nothing could make the return journey through the Axis artillery and machine-gun fire, which began as soon a vehicle appeared above the crest. Around [...] Italian infantry were seen assembling opposite the western face of the outpost and carriers from a scout platoon sallied from the post to disperse them, inflicting many casualties and destroying two vehicles towing captured 6-pounders. Two anti-tank guns were moved to the south-west perimeter from the north, despite the Bren Gun Carriers not having <b>towing</b> <b>attachments</b> and dust thrown up by the move was shelled by Axis artillery, which killed four men.|$|R
40|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} (Caretta caretta) are {{globally}} endangered cold blooded reptiles which {{return to the}} same beach to nest, making each distinct beach and population important for species survival. Time spent between nesting attempts {{is referred to as}} the inter-nesting period and is a short but vital part of a turtle 2 Ì† 7 s life. Determining where turtles spend the vulnerable inter-nesting period is of great importance for the conservation of individual rookeries. The second most important loggerhead rookery in the Mediterranean Sea is found at Kyparissia Bay, Greece, with increasing nest numbers and no national park protection. Kyparissia Bay is unique in its geography and bathymetry, as it is near the northern extreme of nesting beaches, is very deep, and is open to the Ionian Sea. These conditions result in homogenous water that is colder water than many comparable nesting beaches, but warms up as the season progresses. This study, in conjunction with ARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece, investigated the inter-nesting habitat of female loggerhead turtles nesting along Kyparissia Bay through the use of temperature-depth data loggers, radio transmitters, and satellite transmitters. Data loggers were deployed directly on the rear marginal scutes of the carapace, and transmitters were secured using a <b>towed</b> <b>attachment</b> method from the same area. Turtles remained at or near the surface for the entire inter-nesting period (95. 1 percent of time was spent shallower than two meters). Inter-nesting turtles behaved differently from the beginning to the end of the season, in response to increased temperatures later in the year. Later season, warmer individuals were able to dive deeper, travel farther, and had shorter duration inter-nesting periods than earlier turtles in cooler conditions. Two post nesting migrations were also documented; one from Kyparissia Bay to the Aegean Sea and one to the center of the western Mediterranean Sea, north of Algeria. ...|$|R
50|$|The Hawk had {{not been}} {{designed}} for carrier operations, so numerous modifications were required to make it suitable for use on carriers. These included improvements to the low-speed handling characteristics {{and a reduction in}} the approach speed. The aircraft was found to be apt to stall at the low approach speed required. Modifications were designed by BAe in England; most notably a simple slat system was devised, operated by an actuator and linkage mechanism to fit into the small space available. Strakes were also added on the fuselage to improve airflow. Other changes included a strengthened airframe, more robust and wider landing gear with catapult <b>tow</b> bar <b>attachment</b> and an arresting hook, a two-wheel nose landing gear, wing-tips squared off, 6-inch (0.152 m) extension to the tail fin, an increased span tailplane (also with squared-off tips fitted) and a single ventral fin in front of the arrestor hook.|$|R
5000|$|Ludington and Griswold {{had formed}} Ludington-Griswold, Inc. in Saybrook, Connecticut, where a new {{building}} was erected for their research. They had left employment from the Gould Aeronautical Division after the Navy picked up the contract for the LNE-1 glider and production begun. Pratt-Read had won a contract from Materiel Division, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, to manufacture the Army Air Forces Waco CG-4A combat glider. The Ludington-Griswold company shifted their development work to improvements to the CG-4A. Roger Griswold developed a more aerodynamic nose section to replace the boxy and poorly protected cockpit section of the CG-4A with his own design known as the [...] "Griswold Nose." [...] This was fitted to a Pratt-Read glider and flown to Wright Field for evaluation and testing. The nose section {{was found to be}} more aerodynamic, used a <b>tow</b> rope <b>attachment</b> centered {{at the front of the}} nose (unlike the top of the nose attachment found on the CG-4A), and incorporate better protection for the pilots. Wright Field felt that adding the Griswold Nose to the present CG-4A glider would slow down production at a time when glider production was a priority. However, Materiel Division asked Ludington-Griswold to produce a simplified version of the pilot protection assembly and produce it as a bolt on kit to the front of the CG-4A nose section. This led to the development, testing, and production of the [...] "Ludington-Griswold Crash Protection Device" [...] which was manufactured in time to be installed on a number of the CG-4A gliders used in the Normandy D-Day invasion. Subsequent overseas gliders were also fitted with the device which many glider pilots credited in saving injuries and lives.|$|R
40|$|Resisted sprint {{training}} is {{performed in a}} horizontal direction, and involves similar muscles, velocities and ranges of motion (ROM) to those of normal sprinting. Generally, sleds {{are attached to the}} athletes via a lead (3 m) and harness; the most common attachment points are the shoulder or waist. At present, it is not known how the different harness point's impact on the kinematics and kinetics associated with sled towing (ST). The aim of the current investigation was to examine the kinetics and kinematics of shoulder and waist harness attachment points in relation to the acceleration phase of ST. Fourteen trained males completed normal and ST trials, loaded at 10 % reduction of sprint velocity. Sagittal plane kinematics from the trunk, hip, knee and ankle were measured, together with stance phase kinetics (third foot-strike). Kinetic and kinematic parameters were compared between harness attachments using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. The results indicated that various kinetic differences were present between the normal and ST conditions. Significantly greater net horizontal mean force, net horizontal impulses, propulsive mean force and propulsive impulses were measured (p> 0. 05). Interestingly, the waist harness also led to greater net horizontal impulse when compared to the shoulder attachment (p = 0. 000). In kinematic terms, ST conditions significantly increased peak flexion in hip, knee and ankle joints compared to the normal trials (p< 0. 05). Results highlighted that the shoulder harness had a greater impact on trunk and knee joint kinematics when compared to the waist harness (p< 0. 05). In summary, waist harnesses appear to be the most suitable attachment point for the acceleration phase of sprinting. Sled <b>towing</b> with these <b>attachments</b> resulted in fewer kinematic alterations and greater net horizontal impulse when compared to the shoulder harness. Future research is necessary, in order to explore the long-term adaptations of these acute changes...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There are many factors that can influence the effectiveness of any risk management strategy, {{in the case of}} whole-body vibration exposure many problems are faced with the quantification of risk, measurement of risk and subsequent risk reduction. The quantification of vibration effects is equally as complex as the quantification of vibration itself. Exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) causes a distribution of motions and forces within the human body and to complicate matters the transmission of vibration to the body is also dependent on body posture. To-date there has been little attempt to accurately reflect many of the typical postures and vibration environments experienced by operators of earth moving machines in a laboratory setting. The overall aim of the thesis was to determine the variability between humans, machines and task environments in order to provide knowledge to inform improvements in methods of risk management for whole-body vibration exposure. The field measurement phase of the research focused on characterising features of whole-body vibration exposure among operators of earthmoving machines throughout a range of industry sectors. Some of the biggest industries; coal mining, quarries, and construction were targeted to obtain data on the types of machines for which very little was previously available. Research was carried out under real operating conditions to investigate the nature of occupational exposure to whole-body vibration and to determine the causes of variability between measurements. The laboratory phase of the research simulated the conditions of the 'real working environment' observed in the field study in order to examine how twisted non-neutral postures could influence the biomechanical, performance and workload responses of humans. The machines with the greatest vibration emission were generally those that spent most of their time tracking. The worst machine for vibration exposure was a challenger 85 D tracked tractor <b>towing</b> a 'hex' <b>attachment.</b> Operators of this machine would exceed the EU Physical Agents Exposure Limit Value in about 2. 5 hours.

The influence of variability between work cycles was found to be a particular problem for the bulldozer and excavator machines, variation between work cycles exceeded the 25 % variance limit criteria. If these machines were targeted for a WBV health risk assessment then the measurement durations will need to take account of this variation in the extrapolation to an 8 -hour exposure. The operators of these tracked machines were also found to adopt non-neutral twisted postures during reversing manoeuvres. The twisted posture adopted by the bulldozer and tracked loader operators was recreated in the laboratory. Findings demonstrated that operators are likely to be putting their necks in a vulnerable position in the twisted posture due to the large increase in rotational movement at the head during exposure to vibration. Decrements in reaction time performance and increases in workload were also found while individuals were sat in a twisted posture and exposed to vibration.
