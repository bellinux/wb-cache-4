5|$|A. Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva was {{the only}} 2006 Winter Olympics {{medalist}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of their medal. She won a silver medal in the 15km race, but tested positive for carphedon and was thus stripped of her medal. Germany's Martina Glagow was given the silver medal and fellow Russian Albina Akhatova won the bronze.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Betances, who had {{collected}} {{more money in}} France for the Party than the plan's potential cost, grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause. By then, some of the Party's followers stationed in France wanted Betances <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his posts and assignments. At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E

5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> {{every two to}} four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; {{he was unable to}} repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|Internally, Salvin knocked through {{existing}} {{rooms to}} create the Outer Hall, a new gallery on the first floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room. Much of the wooden 17th-century panelling in the parlour and the hall had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> out {{as part of the}} renovations. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the building, an advanced use of that technology for the time. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.|$|E

5|$|The US women's 4 x 400 metres {{relay team}} was {{recommended}} by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of their gold medal, after the suspension of Crystal Cox for doping. The gold medal should theoretically go to Russia, silver to Jamaica and bronze to Great Britain. However, up to today, no further action has been taken by IOC. Hence, the US relay team is still listed as the winner for this event.|$|E
5|$|After {{a return}} to the United States in mid-1970, Yancey entered {{inactive}} status at Norfolk on 1 October of that year. The ship was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 January 1971, and entered the James River berthing area of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Yancey was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977. The vessel remained in the James River fleet until 16 August 1984 when she was withdrawn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of useful equipment by the U.S. Navy. She re-entered the fleet one year later, on 28 August 1985, but was withdrawn for the final time on 15 December 1989 to be prepared for sinking as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Mugabe {{received}} an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from {{him at the}} advice of the UK government in 2008. Mugabe holds several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded to him in the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984. On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986; {{this is the first time}} one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.|$|E
5000|$|The {{search engine}} first filters search terms in several ways. An M {{followed}} by a space or hyphen has the space or hyphen removed, so that searching for Messier catalogue objects is simplified and a user input of M45, M 45 or M-45 all result in the same query being executed; similarly, NGC designations and common search terms such as Shoemaker Levy and T Tauri <b>are</b> <b>stripped</b> of spaces. Unimportant words such as AT, OR and <b>TO</b> <b>are</b> <b>stripped</b> out, although in some cases case sensitivity is maintained, so that while and is ignored, And <b>is</b> converted <b>to</b> [...] "Andromedae", and Her <b>is</b> converted <b>to</b> [...] "Herculis", but her is ignored.|$|R

5|$|The IOC has retested nearly 500 doping {{samples that}} were {{collected}} at the 2006 Turin Games. In 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that a retested sample from cross-country skier Kristina Šmigun had tested positive. On 24 October 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency Athletes' Commission stated that Šmigun, who won two gold medals at the Turin Games, faces a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing {{before the end of}} October. If Šmigun were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of her gold medals, Kateřina Neumannová of Czech Republic could be elevated to gold in the 7.5 + 7.5 km double pursuit event. Marit Bjørgen of Norway could acquire a seventh gold medal in the 10 km classical event.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} sailed in {{the spring}} of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
