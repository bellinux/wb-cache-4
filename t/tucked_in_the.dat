5|$|There are {{references}} to bikinis in ancient literature as well. Ovid, the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace {{as one of}} the three canonical poets of Latin literature, suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and <b>tucked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ends, {{is a good place to}} hide love-letters. Martial, a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism. In an epigram on Chione, Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed. Reportedly Theodora, the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I.|$|E

[...] Among these students was the future author John Irving, who included a quotation from Buechner in the preface of his book A Prayer for Owen Meany. One of Buechner's biographers, Marjorie Casebier McCoy, describes the effect of his time at Exeter as follows: [...] "Buechner in his sermons had been attempting to reach out to the [...] "cultured despisers of religion." [...] The students and faculty at Phillips Exeter had been, for the most part, just that when he had arrived at the school, and it had been they who compelled him to hone his preaching and literary skills to their utmost in order to get a hearing for Christian faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|The current working {{uniform of}} the Coast Guard is the Operational Dress Uniform (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round {{primarily}} as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU {{is similar to the}} Battle Dress Uniform of other armed services, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn <b>tucked</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> second generation ODU is worn untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the left shirt pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with [...] "U.S. Coast Guard." [...] Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the U.S. Public Health Service and the NOAA Corps to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular Navy Working Uniform Type I.|$|E
