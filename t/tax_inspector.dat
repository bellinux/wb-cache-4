5|$|Throughout Western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used {{violence}} and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance {{came to a}} climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of <b>tax</b> <b>inspector</b> General John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania {{to negotiate with the}} rebels, {{while at the same time}} calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax—in the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law. Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.|$|E

40|$|In {{an economy}} where {{corruption}} is pervasive, how should <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors</b> be compensated? The optimal compensation scheme {{must take into}} account the strategic interaction between taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Pure “tax farming” (paying <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors</b> a share of their tax collections) is optimal only when all <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors</b> are corruptible. When there are both honest and corruptible inspectors, the optimal compensation scheme lies-between pure tax farming and a pure wage scheme. Paradoxically, when inspectors are hired beforehand, it may be optimal to offer contracts that attract corruptible inspectors but not the honest ones...|$|R
40|$|Reduction {{of fiscal}} evasion may be pursued by {{introducing}} incentive schemes for <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors.</b> The {{aim of this}} paper is to explain the role of such bonuses in an economic environment with corruption, i. e. in a world where entrepreneurs and <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors</b> are open to bribery. In detail, we analyze the role of a public incentive scheme, where the <b>tax</b> <b>inspector’s</b> bargaining strength is endogenous with re- spect to an incentive mechanism: indeed the knowledge that even if an entrepreneur does not agree to pay the bribe, s/he can report tax evasion and be partly rewarded for this, increases the <b>tax</b> <b>inspector’s</b> bargaining strength...|$|R

While at the Inland Revenue offices in Kent, in 1931, he joined the Maidstone branch of the Labour Party. In 1934, he was transferred to Inland Revenue offices in London. Following a merger of unions in 1936, Callaghan was appointed a full-time union official and to the post of Assistant Secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation and resigned from his Civil Service duties.|$|E
25|$|Where {{it appears}} to the <b>tax</b> <b>inspector</b> that the {{beginning}} or end of any accounting period is uncertain, he may make an assessment on the company for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as appears to him appropriate. In that event, that period is treated for all purposes as an accounting period unless the inspector sees fit to revise it {{as a result of}} receiving further facts, or on an appeal against the assessment in respect of some other matter the company shows the true accounting periods. If on an appeal against an assessment made under this rule the company shows the true accounting periods, the assessment appealed against has effect as an assessment or assessments for the true accounting periods, and assessments may be made for any such periods as might have been made at the time when the assessment appealed against was made.|$|E

25|$|Her {{father was}} a <b>tax</b> <b>inspector,</b> exempt from {{military}} service in the First World War due to his high rank in a reserved occupation. It {{was because of the}} nature of the tax-collecting profession, and the different promotions he received, that the family moved around the country on different occasions. Having moved to Bradford in 1922, the Betts family swiftly became involved with the Independent Labour Party. Although her father was prohibited from formal political activity because of his role as a civil servant, he became editor of the Bradford Pioneer, the city's socialist newspaper, after William Leach was elected to Parliament in 1935. Castle's mother ran the family home, while also operating a soup-kitchen for the town's miners. After Barbara had left home, Annie was elected as a Labour Councillor in Bradford, a role which she kept quite secret from even her close family.|$|E
500|$|Federal <b>tax</b> <b>inspector</b> {{for western}} Pennsylvania General John Neville was {{determined}} to enforce the excise law. He was a prominent politician and wealthy planter—and also a large-scale distiller. He had initially opposed the whiskey tax, but subsequently changed his mind, a reversal that angered some western Pennsylvanians. In August 1792, Neville rented a room in Pittsburgh for his tax office, but the landlord turned him out after being threatened with violence by the Mingo Creek Association. From this point on, tax collectors {{were not the only}} people targeted in Pennsylvania; those who cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment. Anonymous notes and newspaper articles signed by [...] "Tom the [...] " [...] threatened those who complied with the whiskey tax. Those who failed to heed the warnings might have their barns burned or their stills destroyed.|$|E
500|$|To {{minimize}} her tax liability, Heyer {{formed a}} {{limited liability company}} called Heron Enterprises around 1950. Royalties from new titles would {{be paid to the}} company, which would then furnish Heyer's salary and pay directors' fees to her family. She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother. Within several years, however, a <b>tax</b> <b>inspector</b> found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company. The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes. To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, [...] "Books about the Brontës" [...] and [...] "How to be a Literary Writer", that were published in the magazine Punch. She once wrote to a friend, [...] "I'm getting so tired of writing books {{for the benefit of the}} Treasury and I can't tell you how utterly I resent the squandering of my money on such fatuous things as Education and Making Life Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in a Tony Marchant drama playing Michael Ride in Into the Fire (1996), and the following year played the lead role of Shaun Southerns in Marchant's BBC series Holding On (1997). Southerns, a crooked <b>tax</b> <b>inspector,</b> {{was the first of}} many [...] "men in turmoil" [...] roles for Morrissey, and it earned him a nomination for the Royal Television Society (RTS) Programme Award for Best Male Actor the next year. In 1998, he appeared in Our Mutual Friend alongside Paul McGann. As he was a fan of the book, Morrissey asked director Julian Farino if he could play Eugene Wrayburn, but the role went to McGann. Farino had Morrissey in mind to play schoolmaster Bradley Headstone, a part Morrissey was reluctant to take until he read the script. He studied the role and decided to take it on the basis that the character was unloved and that his motivation by social class causes his mental health problems. His performance was described by a Guardian writer as bringing [...] "unprecedented depth to a character [...] who is more commonly portrayed as just another horrible Dickens git." [...] In the same year, he played Christopher [...] "Kiffer" [...] Finzi in Anand Tucker's Hilary and Jackie. His roles in Our Mutual Friend and Hilary and Jackie were described as his breakthrough roles by Zoe Williams of The Guardian.|$|E

40|$|In this review, {{focusing}} upon comparative {{cases of}} <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors</b> and nurses, we address {{debate about whether}} development of hybrid manager roles represents controlled professionalism or organizing professionalism. We evaluate whether the activities of hybrid managers are desirable in broader terms, whether the actions of hybrid managers transcend executive managers’ or policy-makers’ interests to serve a broader societal interest, thereby retaining a hallmark of professionalism. We argue that <b>tax</b> <b>inspectors</b> enact the hybrid role in a way characteristic of controlled professionalism. Meanwhile hybrid nurse managers enact their role characteristic of controlled professionalism in a poor performing organization, but more characteristic of organizing professionalism in a high performing organization. Despite our mixed analysis of how this plays out on the ground, we remain optimistic that managerial practice of hybrids can be managed from within professional ranks, {{and in a way}} that meets organizational and public interest simultaneously. ...|$|R
