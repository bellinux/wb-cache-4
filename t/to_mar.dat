Vice Admiral Jorge Dodsworth Martins—Brazil's chief of naval intelligence—thought that Bahia could have been mined or torpedoed by , which surrendered under strange circumstances in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on 10 July (some two months after Germany's surrender), but the Argentine Naval Ministry stated {{that it would have}} been impossible for the submarine to travel from the site of the sinking <b>to</b> <b>Mar</b> del Plata in six days (4–10 July). The U-977, which crew was also heading to Argentina seeking for asylum, was also accused of sinking Bahia. However, military investigations carried out by both US and Brazilian Navies, concluded that the cruiser had been indeed sunk due to the above described gunnery accident.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch East India Company {{defeated}} Portuguese for {{the supremacy}} of spice trade in Malabar in the year CE 1663. Malankara Nazranis used this opportunity to escape from Latin persecution {{with the help of}} Dutch East India Company. The Dutch brought Bishop Gregorios Abdul Jaleel of Jerusalem of Syrian Orthodox Church in their trading vessel in CE 1665. Thomas Arkadyaqon who was consecrated as Mar Thoma I entered into a relationship with the West Syriac Orthodox Church and gradually adopted West Syrian liturgy and practices. The Dutch was on the Malabar Coast from 11 November 1604 - 1795. Mar Thoma I <b>to</b> <b>Mar</b> Thoma VI were the prelates during this period.|$|E
25|$|This trend {{continued}} in the following years and the government began re-opening services and improving on the once private services using completely new rolling stock, including long distance services like the one from Buenos Aires <b>to</b> <b>Mar</b> del Plata and Buenos Aires-Rosario-Cordoba. This new-found investment in the railways has not been limited to rolling stock since, in many cases, the state has completely replaced, or {{is in the process}} of replacing, the existing infrastructure with continuous welded rails on concrete sleepers and undertaking other works such as renovating level crossings and building new railway bridges. The freight network has also received significant investment from China, with two investments totalling US$4.8 billion made in 2013 and 2015.|$|E

25|$|Leloir's parents, Federico Leloir and Hortensia Aguirre de Leloir, {{traveled}} from Buenos Aires to Paris {{in the middle}} of 1906 with the intention of treating Federico's illness. However, Federico died in late August, and a week later Luis was born in an old house at 81 Víctor Hugo Road in Paris, a few blocks away from the Arc de Triomphe. After returning to Argentina in 1908, Leloir lived together with his eight siblings on their family's extensive property El Tuyú that his grandparents had purchased after their immigration from the Basque Country of northern Spain: El Tuyú comprises 400km2 of sandy land along the coastline from San Clemente del Tuyú <b>to</b> <b>Mar</b> de Ajó which has since become a popular tourist attraction.|$|E
25|$|In 1808, a bond for {{the sum of}} 3000 Star Pagoda (Rs.10,500) {{was handed}} over by Col.

Col Munro the British Resident in Travancore gave the interest of the deposit to Joseph Ramban due to misunderstandings and lack of regularized administration. In order to avoid the quandary in 1815, Joseph Ramban was consecrated by Mar Philexenos of the Thozhyoor Church and was given the ecclesiastical title Mar Dionysious. To make the Malankara Church accept him as their head, Col. Munroe had to get the rulers of Travancore and Cochin issue Royal proclamations ordering Christians to render obedience <b>to</b> <b>Mar</b> Dionysious.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{it was thought that}} only Smith had seen the manuscript. However, in 2003, Guy Stroumsa {{reported}} that he and a group of other scholars had seen it in 1976. During a visit <b>to</b> <b>Mar</b> Saba, Stroumsa, along with the late Hebrew University professors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines, Greek Orthodox Archimandrite Meliton, and a Mar Saba monk, relocated the document where Smith had left it. Stroumsa, Meliton, and company determined that the manuscript might be safer in Jerusalem than in Mar Saba. They took it back with them, and Meliton subsequently brought it to the Patriarchate library. The group looked into having the ink tested but the only entity in the area with such technology was the Jerusalem police. Meliton did not want to leave the manuscript with the police, so no test was taken. Stroumsa published his account upon learning that he was the last living Western academic to have seen the letter.|$|E
