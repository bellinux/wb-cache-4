30|$|There {{are three}} main types of version files’ storage, i.e., full storage, {{incremental}} storage, and differential <b>storage.</b> <b>The</b> full <b>storage</b> is <b>the</b> {{starting point for}} all other storages and contains all the data in a file that are selected to be stored. <b>The</b> incremental <b>storage</b> is to store all the changed data in a file since <b>the</b> last <b>storage</b> was made. They do this whether <b>the</b> last <b>storage</b> was a full one or an incremental copy. For example, if a full storage was done by node 1, node 2 stores all the changed data of the file after node 1 by <b>the</b> incremental <b>storage.</b> Likewise, node 3 only copies those changed data in the file after node 2 ’s incremental <b>storage.</b> <b>The</b> differential <b>storage</b> copies those changed data in the file since <b>the</b> last full <b>storage</b> took place. For example, if a full storage was done by node 1, node 2 will copy all changed data of the file by <b>the</b> differential <b>storage</b> since node 1 ’s storage copied everything. Also, node 3 will copy all changed data of the file by <b>the</b> differential <b>storage</b> since node 1 ’s full storage was made.|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} discussion, {{the performance of}} <b>the</b> pumped <b>storage</b> scheme is {{compared with that of}} <b>the</b> battery <b>storage</b> scheme. <b>The</b> model of <b>the</b> battery <b>storage</b> system can be referred to in [20]. Battery (Dryfit A 600) parameters are cited from the literature in [12]. 24 batteries are connected with a group within the 48 V DC bus in series. The decision variables of <b>the</b> battery <b>storage</b> scheme include <b>the</b> number of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and the battery bank capacity. And the optimal configuration model of <b>the</b> battery <b>storage</b> scheme can be obtained by editing the model of the optimal configuration of <b>the</b> pumped <b>storage</b> system with considering the effect of the inverter conveyance efficiency on <b>the</b> energy <b>storage</b> system.|$|R
30|$|Although {{pumped storage}} scheme is {{equipped}} with more renewable energy installed capacity and <b>the</b> pumped <b>storage</b> system comprehensive efficiency is low, the lower cost and the longer life of <b>the</b> pumped <b>storage</b> make it more economical than that of <b>the</b> battery <b>storage.</b>|$|R

When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
