When their training was completed, they debuted in their uncle Afa's World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. He later began teaming with Samu as the Samoan Gangsta Party, using the name Mack Daddy Kane. They had a brief stint in ECW {{in the summer of}} 1996, feuding with various tag teams, including The Gangstas, as well as the Eliminators and the Bruise Brothers, and wrestled against Axl Rotten and Hack Meyers at Hardcore Heaven in June 1996. He returned to WXW in 1997, where Anoaʻi held the WXW Tag Team Championship as one half of the Samoan Gangstas with his cousin L.A. Smooth on two occasions. They defeated the Love Connection <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> first title reign on May 24, and the Mad Russian and the Russian Eliminator on September 17 <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> second. He also competed in the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in Puerto Rico during 1997, winning the WWC World Tag Team Championship with Tahiti as The Islanders on June 22.|$|E

5|$|When {{he first}} started his {{scouting}} career, Krichell followed {{the example of}} early baseball scouts. He traveled with the Yankees for spring training to view his signees playing baseball. When the Yankees traveled north <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> season, Krichell usually followed. He also scouted the local newspapers to look for games in which potential prospects were playing.|$|E
5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades {{were already}} on the ground before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} days Hoesin repeatedly visits Rasminah, and slowly the two begin {{to fall in}} love. When Rasminah takes her aunt to Batavia to live, Hoesin follows. They begin discussing their future together, but Rasminah insists that she will only marry when her aunt is reunited with Kasimin. After a lengthy search, in which he almost gives up hope, Hoesin finds Kasimin at a small plantation in the hills outside of the city– Hadidjah's long-lost husband previously operated his own orchard, but had been evicted by a conniving and greedy landlord only days before. Kasimin and Hadidjah are reunited, allowing Hoesin and Rasminah <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> own preparations.|$|E
5|$|The German attacks {{convinced}} Lieutenant General John Crocker, {{commander of}} I Corps, {{to reinforce the}} 6th Airborne Division, and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was ordered {{to take over the}} southern sector of the Orne bridgehead. At the same time the 5th Battalion Black Watch was attached to the 3rd Parachute Brigade. The Black Watch were informed to prepare for an assault to capture Bréville and formed up {{to the rear of the}} 9th Parachute Battalion, ready <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> attack the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisions}} {{had been}} made {{at the highest levels}} and planning had been completed, but valuable time had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack of time for adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive. On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation Dewey Canyon II was under way.|$|E

5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; {{this may be a}} common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to control the direction of their descent while falling.|$|E
5|$|The season {{chosen for}} leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves {{time to do}} the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E
5|$|This tit-tyrant {{appears to}} be {{territorial}} in defending what it regards as its feeding territory, although it only displays territorial behavior against other tufted tit-tyrants. Birds defending their territory, either alone or in a pair, tend <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> defense by calling rapidly and displaying displacement behavior, such as bill wiping or wing flaring. They then raise their crest and chase the other tit-tyrant through the shrubs, occasionally physically attacking the intruder. The victorious tit-tyrant then returns to its normal foraging behavior. The southern subspecies, A. p. patagonicus, migrates to northern Argentina after the breeding season; the other populations appear to be non-migratory.|$|E

30|$|Moodle, the LMS that was, {{and still}} is, {{being used by}} the University, was the first ICT that {{students}} were asked if they knew prior <b>to</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>their</b> studies. This was important because, as has been mentioned, over 80 % of the students at UNE chose to study in online mode. Therefore, an understanding of how to use the learning management system was crucial. However, it was not a requirement that students had knowledge of the LMS prior to study as they would be provided with the knowledge once enrolled. Twenty-nine percent of respondents indicated that they had no knowledge of Moodle prior <b>to</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>their</b> studies. Thirty-eight percent indicated that they had an account and were an active user. It could be assumed that these respondents were school leavers and had used Moodle whilst studying at school. Or, alternatively, students could have studied at another institution, or in another course at UNE, prior to commencing their studies with the authors, when asked this question. Unfortunately, the question was not asked for respondents to clarify their answer.|$|R
50|$|After {{earning a}} commission, Unrestricted Line Officer Marine lieutenants {{complete}} the Officer Basic Course prior <b>to</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>their</b> Military Occupational Speciality (MOS) qualification training {{to prepare them}} for service in the Fleet Marine Force or other operating forces assignments (viz., Marine Corps Security Force Regiment or the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group). The majority of Marine Corps officers are commissioned through the USMC Officer Candidate School (OCS), most of the balance are commissioned through the Marine Corps option at either the U.S. Naval Academy or the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) at a civilian college or university. (Annually, there are a few officers who graduate from one of the other US federal service academies who are granted permission to receive USMC commissions.) Restricted Line/Limited Duty Officers are direct commissioned from the chief warrant officer ranks as either a first lieutenant or captain and do not attend BOC; however, as warrant officers they have already completed the WOBC at TBS prior <b>to</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>their</b> officer service in the operating forces.|$|R
5|$|Waugh {{managed to}} extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was {{recruited}} by Randolph Churchill to serve in a military mission to Yugoslavia, and, early in July, flew with Churchill from Bari, Italy, to the Croatian island of Vis. There, they met Marshal Tito, the Communist leader of the Partisans, who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying Axis forces with Allied support. Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.|$|E
5|$|After Gaza was {{occupied}} on 7 November, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (XXI Corps) rode through {{the ruins of}} Gaza to reach Beit Hanun at 13:00; and the 157th Brigade (52nd Division) began the infantry pursuit along the Mediterranean shore, to reach Sheikh Hasan by 12:15. In {{the centre of the}} line the Anzac Mounted Division found a gap on the eastern side of Sheria <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> pursuit at daylight on 7 November. After being held up at Sheria, the Australian Mounted Division and the 60th (London) Division advanced to capture Huj on 8 November. By that evening, all the Ottoman positions which had made up the Gaza-to-Beersheba line had been captured, and the erstwhile defenders were in full retreat.|$|E
5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, {{even those who are}} acclimatized. In serious cases, it can lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|Early on 1 September 1939, Germany {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Poland. Schleswig-Holstein had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte {{under the guise of}} a ceremonial visit in August. At 04:47 on 1 September, Schleswig-Holstein opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the signal for ground troops <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> assault on the installation; though the first German ground attack in the Battle of Westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that morning, again supported by Schleswig-Holstein, though it too had failed to break into the installation by around noon.|$|E
5|$|Georgia {{joined the}} Great White Fleet on 16 December 1907, when they {{departed}} Hampton Roads <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> circumnavigation of the globe. The {{purpose of the}} cruise was a show of naval strength. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Meldrum's Force, {{commanded}} by Brigadier-General W.

This force concentrated {{half an hour later}} east of Musallabeh, <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>their</b> advance to Kh. Fusail where they arrived just before midnight. At the same time, the Commander Royal Artillery (CRA) pushed guns forward into Mellaha to attack Ottoman guns on Red Hill on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade took over the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade position at Madbeh.|$|E
