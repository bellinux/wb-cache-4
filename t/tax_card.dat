5000|$|From 1956 to 1963 Glistrup was an {{associate}} professor in tax law at the University of Copenhagen, and after leaving the university he became the owner of one of Denmark's leading law firms. On national television in 1971 on the last day for sending in the tax return, he praised tax fraudsters as the [...] "freedom fighters of our time," [...] and he displayed his own <b>tax</b> <b>card</b> with a tax rate of zero. His television appearance triggered an outrage, and Finance Minister Poul Møller made a complaint to Danmarks Radio, stating that they should rather have presented factual information on filling out the tax return. The government proceeded to have police and tax authorities begin an investigation into Glistrup's finances.|$|E

50|$|Tipping (dricks) is {{commonly}} not expected, but is practiced to reward high quality service or {{as a kind}} gesture. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change on the table or rounding up the bill. This is mostly done at restaurants (less often if payment is made at the desk) and in taxis (some taxis are very expensive {{as there is no}} fixed tariff, so they might not be tipped). Less often hairdressers are tipped. Tips are taxed in Sweden, but cash tips are not much declared to the <b>tax</b> authority. <b>Cards</b> are heavily used in Sweden as of the 2010s, and tips paid by cards in restaurants are regularly checked by the tax authority.

5000|$|Historically, Spain {{was split}} into several {{independent}} states. Even after these states began {{sharing the same}} monarchy, they maintained their own separate parliaments, laws, and taxes for several centuries. In the 16th century, Spain became the first country to <b>tax</b> playing <b>cards.</b> The various regions and states kept track of the taxes they were owed by requiring producers, who were often monopolies (estanco), to conform to a regional pattern for cards sold locally. Known regional patterns include the Seville, Madrid, Toledo, Valencia, and Catalonia patterns. There were also export patterns, possibly including the little known Toulouse/Girona pattern or the [...] "Dragon cards" [...] (see below). Spain and France exported cards to each other, which explains why the kings and jacks in French-suited face cards resemble their Spanish counterparts, notably the standing kings. There was some deliberate copying; the king of coins from the Seville and Franco-Spanish patterns is near identical to the king of hearts in the French-suited Rouen pattern, which was exported to England and through centuries of bad reproduction {{became known as the}} [...] "suicide king".|$|R

To institute these reforms, the Crown sent Juan Francisco Gutiérrez de Piñeres to the colony in 1777, with the title of visitador (inspector). He established a tobacco monopoly, prohibiting its cultivation in certain regions, such as Socorro and Chiriquí Province. He set <b>taxes</b> on playing <b>cards</b> and aguardiente, organized the tax office, and set up customs offices in Cartagena and Bogotá.|$|R

5000|$|When {{served on}} an employer, garnishments are taken {{as part of}} the payroll process. When {{processing}} payroll, sometimes there is not enough money in the employee's net pay to satisfy all of the garnishments. For example, in a case with federal tax, local <b>tax,</b> and credit <b>card</b> garnishments, the first garnishment taken would be the federal tax garnishments, then local tax garnishments, and, finally, garnishments for the credit card. Employers receive a notice telling them to withhold a certain amount of their employee's wages for payment and cannot refuse to garnish wages. Employers must correctly calculate the amount to withhold, and must make the deductions until the garnishment expires.|$|R
5000|$|Egypt made {{starting}} a business easier {{by establishing a}} single access point with standardized application forms in 2004, a one stop shop. Egypt centralized start-up paperwork in a single building, where company charters were to be submitted electronically and reapproved by the registry on the spot. Improvements continued at the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) one-stop shop in Cairo. The number of procedures was supposed to fall from 10 to 7. The entrepreneur can now register for taxes at {{the chamber of commerce}} directly through the one-stop shop. As a result of the reforms, the start-up time and costs were supposedly cut by more than half. Alexandria and Assiut, followed the model in Cairo, although both cities have to send a fax to the central commercial registry in Cairo to check that the company name has not been used. A computerization project is underway so that one-stop shops outside Cairo can issue the <b>tax</b> registration <b>card</b> locally. [...] Since the reform of the GAFI one stop shop in 2004, the total number of companies registered in Cairo more than doubled: 5,700 were registered in 2005 compared with 2,660 in 2003. [...] However, some observers have suggested that Egypt's one stop shop system has not reduced the amount of procedures as much as initially promised.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first major study of gaming in England between c. 1540 and 1760. Gaming - which may be defined loosely as games of chance played for stakes hazarded by the players, {{especially}} cards and dice - was rife in early modern England. People from virtually all social groupings played at cards and at dice and engaged with gaming in many different ways. Chapter one provides a narrative {{of the development of}} the playing card trade, {{and the ways in which}} it was taxed, in order to place gaming in a broader economic context. It shows that over one million packs of playing cards were being produced by the late seventeenth century and examines the fraud and forgery that occurred after the Stamp Act of 1710 greatly increased the <b>tax</b> on <b>cards.</b> Much gaming was illegal; and through an analysis of legislation and legal records chapter two investigates the ways in which gaming, and especially gaming houses, were policed. Chapter three focuses on the places in which gaming was conducted, including coffeehouses and alehouses. It also discusses gaming in the home and, more generally, the ways in which gaming was a part of socialising and sociability. Chapter four examines printed debates about the morality of gaming, explores attitudes towards recreation, and explains the ways in which gaming contributed to early ideas about chance, providence and probability. Seventeenth- and eighteenthcentury gaming manuals are also considered in detail. The final chapter interrogates attitudes to cheats and cheating and addresses the ways in which credit - both social and material - might be constructed or lost at the gaming table...|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Gretzky {{sold the}} card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the <b>taxes</b> on the <b>card,</b> so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on.

Sanchez has stated that she owns a home in Las Vegas and listed herself as based in Los Angeles as a marketing ploy due to the types of opportunities available in Los Angeles relative to those available in Las Vegas.|$|R
