40|$|A three stage heat {{transfer}} is employed {{to eliminate the}} tin ball-up problem. A void nucleation problem is encountered in stage I {{and it can be}} reduced by minimizing time at stage I. Therefore, T(,d), the tin depletion time, is important in order to minimize time at stage I. Experiments on stage I heat treatment in three geometrical conditions, planar, internal tin and external tin, are studied in order to determine T(,d) values. The depletion of tin layer is proportional to the square root of time for the planar and external tin cases. A finite-difference numerical analysis is applied to study these three geometrical conditions. The numerical model predicts T(,d) values slightly less than the experimental results. Possible causes of disagreement have been discussed. The results show that the planar geometry is the upper bound solution of the external <b>tin</b> <b>wire</b> condition and the internal <b>tin</b> <b>wire</b> condition is the lower bound solution of the external <b>tin</b> <b>wire</b> condition...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{fabrication}} of the fiber-shaped lithium ion batteries assembled by twisting a cathode filament {{together with an}} anode filament. The cathode filament is fabricated by depositing a LiFePO 4 (LFP) -composite layer onto a steel-filled polyester conductive thread (SPCT). As anode filaments, we propose several scenarios including a Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) -composite coated SPCT (dip-and-dry deposition), a tin-coated SPCT (PVD deposition) {{as well as a}} bare <b>tin</b> <b>wire.</b> An electrolyte composite layer consisting of LiPF 6 and polyethylene oxide (PEO) is then deposited onto both the anode and cathode filament before the battery assembly. By twisting the cathode filament and anode filament together using a customized jig, the batteries are then assembled. The open-circuit voltage is found to be ~ 2. 3 V for the battery using the LTO@SPCT anode, and ~ 3. 3 V for the battery using the tin@SPCT anode and the <b>tin</b> <b>wire</b> anode. Charge-discharge tests are carried out at different C rates for each battery sample. Experimental results suggest that the LIBs using the LTO@SPCT anode, the tin@SPCT anode and the bare <b>tin</b> <b>wire</b> anode could achieve a specific capacity of ~ 64, ~ 67, and ~ 96 mAh/g, respectively, when charge-discharged at 0. 5 -C rate. The battery could retain well its capacity after 80 charge-discharge cycles. During operation of all the batteries reported in this paper, their coulombic efficiency remained above 80 %. Among the advantages of the proposed LIB are light weight, ease of fabrication, high specific capacitance, high energy density, and good durability. Finally, employing cheap and commercially-available steel-filled polyester threads as a base material in our batteries, makes them potentially suitable for integration into wearables using various standard textile manufacturing techniques...|$|R

40|$|In Nb 3 Sn CIC conductors, the superconducting {{compound}} {{is distributed}} into fine filaments and {{embedded in a}} resistive matrix for electrical and thermal stability. Nb 3 Sn formation requires a solid state diffusion reaction at high temperature, which causes an Sn gradient inside the filaments. It {{is well known that}} the critical parameters vary with composition (Sn content) and strain state. In this work the complete 3 D strain field is computed for different wire layouts. First, the relation between the grade of filament reaction and strain is investigated: superconducting wires are studied, taking into consideration non-homogeneous Nb 3 Sn filaments, i. e. considering an unreacted core of pure Nb. Furthermore, the case when the filaments agglomerate together to give a ‘macrofilament’ is also taken into consideration (internal <b>tin</b> <b>wires).</b> A finite element discretization fine enough to take into consideration non-homogeneous filaments would result in a very high number of unknowns, which could be beyond the capacity of today’s computers. Therefore a thermo-mechanical model is formulated, based on the generalized self-consistent method, suitably developed to deal with the material nonlinearity and the coupling between the thermal and mechanical fields. In this way, equivalent homogeneous properties are obtained and the analysis of the wires becomes feasible. An appropriate unsmearing technique finally gives the strain state in the real, not homogenized, materials...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the field of cultural appropriation, within the practice of working with sloyd and handicraft in Sweden. Though the subject of cultural appropriation is widely discussed in society today, the author of this thesis can see a huge lack of discourse on the matter in the sloyd and craft context. By studying the manufacturing of <b>tin</b> <b>wire</b> bracelets within the Sami culture as well as amongst other non-Sami craftsmen/women, the level of cultural appropriation will be over looked and in the end discussed. Complementing this analysis, the thesis investigates what it is that craftsmen/women find most important in their working process, and where they would draw the line between inspiration and theft when it comes to craft. This is achieved by studies of research within the field of cultural appropriation, Sami culture, as well as laws and legislation within the craft field. In addition to this, four qualitative interviews are made as well as limited archive studies. This is all analysed through hermeneutic methods of interpretation. The results show that {{there are several ways to}} claim ownership of a specific expression of craft, which can be both legal and/or moral. The legal ways are mostly provided by Patent- och Registreringsverket (The Patent and Registry Office) as well as certain protections for Sami craftsmen/women called Duodji, while the moral ones are sprung out of human beings and active discussions. The answers of the four interviews indicates that there are differences between the Sami and the non-Sami participants when it comes to what they mark as important in their craft process. The results of this thesis implicate that there are in fact signs of cultural appropriation being made upon the Sami craft culture, and that this may be evaded by stronger and better legislation on both craft objects as well as rights for minority groups in Sweden.

40|$|Stories of {{conflict}} between the Aborigines and the early squatters and their servants have been commonplace in Australian writing {{since the middle of}} the nineteenth century. Yet many problems confront the historian wishing to reassess this aspect of our past. Perhaps the most difficult is the task of trying to look at early race relations from the other side of the frontier, to see the encroaching tide of settlement as far as possible through the eyes of the Aborigines themselves. Clearly no easy endeavourI The historian- perhaps rather the ethno-historian- has to piece together innumerable fragments of information provided by European informants while rejecting much that can be assumed to be inaccurate, or hearsay or excess-ively biased. Fortunately a small number of explorers, officials or squatters were remarkably intelligent and perceptive observers of Aboriginal life despite the lack of sophisticated anthropological knowledge. Informa-tion gathered has to be weighed and tested against modern studies of traditional life and acculturation in Central and Northern Australia. What eventually emerges can hopefully be built up into a meaningful mosaic of the Aboriginal response to settlement. We can assume that most Aboriginal groups had at least some prior knowledge of Europeans before the first settlers arrived. European comm-odities- pieces of iron, horseshoes, <b>tins,</b> <b>wire,</b> glass and even tomahawks-had passed along Aboriginal trade routes to tribes far behind the frontier perhaps as much as ten or twenty years before the first white men appeared. But what of information about the strange and powerful newcomers? Did that too pass along the routes of trade and ceremonial exchange? We know that myths and dances crisis-crossed the continent in a remarkably short time being passed on from tribe to tribe. In similar fashion scattered news of the settlers may have gone ahead of the moving frontier. This seems especially true of information about the terrifying power of Euro-pean firearms. Various bits of evidence support this. Settlers often found that Aborigines with no known previous contact were extremely frightened of guns even without their being fired. Similar informatio...|$|R

40|$|Seed tagging {{is widely}} used for {{tracking}} seeds during dispersal by seed-caching animals. No studies, however, have fully {{examined the effects of}} seed tagging on post-dispersal seed fate. We studied how two seed tagging techniques - thread-marking and wire tin-tagging - affected seed fate by placing tagged and untagged seeds in simulated seed sources and caches and comparing removal rates and fates, and by comparing seedling establishment between tagged and untagged seeds. Tagging had little effect on whether seeds were eaten or dispersed, though both marking methods significantly delayed seed removal by rodents. Both marking methods proved effective for retrieving removed seeds and their fates, but because rodents bit off thread not wire, wire tin-tagging yielded a much higher recovery rate and more accurate estimation of seed fate. We found little difference in dispersal distance between the tagging methods. Piercing of the cotyledons negatively affected seedling emergence in one of two seed species tested. <b>Wire</b> <b>tin</b> tags are a suitable alternative for tracking seeds where seed-caching rodents tend to cut or detach thread marks and yield results comparable to thread-marking. However, both seed tagging methods may underestimate seed dispersal and survival due to delayed removal and damage of the cotyledons by piercing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
