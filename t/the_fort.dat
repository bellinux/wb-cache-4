5|$|In April 1863, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> {{was named}} in honor of the {{recently}} deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the time of its dedication, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A service road crossed the trenches in the southern half of <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> connecting with River Road behind <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons. A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an outwork of <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest of <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mughals lost <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> to the Afghan Durranis, {{who in turn}} briefly lost <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> to Maratha forces {{before being}} re{{captured}} by the Durranis. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> was then captured by the Bhangi Misl - one of the 12 Sikh Misls of Punjab that ruled Lahore from 1767 until 1799. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> fell to the army of Ranjit Singh, who took Lahore from the Bhangi Misl in 1799. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> and the city remained {{under the control of}} Ranjit Singh's family until the fall of the last Sikh empire in 1849.|$|E
5|$|A factory was {{established}} soon after <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was constructed and it minted coins that bore the initials TB or DB, indicating Dansborg. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> acted as the important gateway {{in the trade}} route from Europe to Coramandel. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king Fredric IV, who was also the head of Lutheran Church of Denmark. Two of them, namely, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, established the Tranquebar Mission, learnt Tamil {{in a few years}} and were the first to translate and print The New Testament of the Bible in Tamil in the printing press inside <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> The Danish mission was the first Protestant mission in India and from its inception, was staffed by German missionaries trained at Pietist schools and seminary founded by Francke at the end of 17th century. A Tamil-Latin dictionary containing 9000 words was compiled there by a medical missionary named Friedrich Koenig in 1778, whose source letters are stored in the royal archives. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> is featured in a large number of videos, films and commercials. After India's independence in 1947, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the State Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> is now used as a museum, housing a collection of major artifacts of <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> and the Danish empire. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> {{is one of the most}} visited tourist landmarks in the region.|$|E
50|$|Only <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> {{earthworks}} are now visible, the Wall at {{this point}} and <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> north ramparts having been demolished for the construction of General Wade's early 18th-century military road (now the B6318). The late 19th-century archaeologist John Clayton carried out a partial excavation of the site, revealing a military bath-house outside <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> west gate (in 1873) and <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> south-west corner-tower (in 1876).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>forts</b> of gagangad and Shivgad were {{situated}} in Gagan Bavda jahagir. In 1846 the old buildings on <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> were demolished after {{which there was}} no habitation on <b>the</b> <b>forts.</b> until <b>the</b> time Gagangiri maharaj built and ashram on gagangad fort.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge caused <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> {{destruction}} in 1960; the Brooklyn-side bridge pillars now occupy <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> former foundation site.|$|R
5|$|ASquadron 4RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) {{continued}} the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. Concealed in hull down positions behind a ridge near <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged ASquadron, disabling five tanks, but {{were forced to}} withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the final approach to Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's leading CCompany, and the attack on <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> began without armoured support. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> was vigorously defended, {{and it was not}} until just before midday that CCompany, reunited with ASquadron 4RTR and reinforced by A and BCompanies 1DLI, eventually took the position. DCompany 1DLI—which had been in reserve during the attack—then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing ground to the north of <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> {{remained}} standing into the 1840s; {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the war's conclusion the site was occupied by two squatters. In 1847 George Bainbridge purchased the land and <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> from the United States federal government. Bainbridge salvaged what logs were usable from <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> dismantling it in the process, and used them to construct a barn on his property. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> site remained relatively undisturbed in the ensuing years. In 1994 the non-profit Apple River Historical Foundation was organized and archaeological investigation was conducted in 1995. In June 1997 a reconstruction effort ended, and today a replica of <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> stands to the south of the original site, which remains undisturbed to preserve its archaeological integrity.|$|E
5|$|After two failed {{attempts}} to capture <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> by straight forward attacks, the British resorted to attrition tactics. On 28 November, instead of launching another infantry assault, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was encircled {{from all sides}} and placed under siege. This prevented Nepalese reinforcements from entering <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> Mawbey then instructed his gunners, by now strongly reinforced, to fire into <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> He also sent scouts to locate and cut off the fort's external water source. The water situation was made worse for the defenders when about a hundred earthen vessels stocked with water, stored in a portico, were destroyed in the bombardment. The eastern and northern walls of <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> were razed to the ground. The continuous bombardment also caused {{three of the four}} cannons installed on the fort's battlements to fall outside <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> while the other fell inside. The other cannons that the Nepalese possessed were unusable, having either been disabled by misfiring during previous attacks, or because they had been buried under rubble in the British bombardment. Left without any cannons to reply, the garrison suffered heavy casualties. They continued to resist using gunfire and stones, but eventually the few people that remained in <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> became desperate and could not hold on any longer. That night, despite threats to their person and property, desertion became rampant.|$|E
50|$|In the First World War the {{vulnerability}} of <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> had become evident. The development of artillery went faster than the construction of resistant fortifications. <b>The</b> concept of <b>forts</b> had become redundant. After the First World War <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> were therefore no longer seen as a defence line, but the role of <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> {{would be in the}} form of infantry support.|$|R

5|$|An irregularly shaped parade area {{occupies}} {{the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> which is divided by a sloping ramp {{leading up to the}} casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands {{to the right of the}} ramp. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E
5|$|At around 2:50p.m., the B-10 rifles on {{the west}} bank managed to open a breach in the barbed wire {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> and also destroyed other significant targets, such as the observation equipment. Meanwhile, combat engineers were breaching further openings using Bangalore torpedoes, under heavy small arms fire and hand grenades. The battalion's main assault force was crossing at the same time. The main assault force then funneled through the breaches and entered the Israeli trenches. The Israeli command in Northern Sinai kept receiving frantic calls for help from the fort's radio operator, and gunfire could also be heard. The Egyptians captured the southern sector of <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> by 3:05p.m.. Five minutes later, the assault force moved against the northern sector of <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> Within fifteen minutes, the Egyptians were in control of <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> The power generator inside <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was destroyed, and all electricity and communication lines leading to <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> were severed. At 3:30p.m., Maj. Gen. Khaled was informed that Lahtzanit had been seized and that Israeli soldiers had been captured. The Israelis reported losing radio contact with <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> at around 4:00p.m.|$|E
5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> be demolished. Debates over <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon forgotten in the ensuing decades.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, General Butler was {{preparing}} his soldiers {{for an attack}} on <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> that were now in Farragut's rear. Commodore Porter, {{now in charge of}} the flotilla still below <b>the</b> <b>forts,</b> delivered a demand to surrender to <b>the</b> <b>forts,</b> but General Duncan refused. Accordingly, Porter again began to bombard <b>the</b> <b>forts,</b> this time in preparation for Butler's assault. However, on the night of April 29, the enlisted garrison in Fort Jackson mutinied and refused to endure more. Although Fort St. Philip was not involved in the mutiny, the interdependence of <b>the</b> two <b>forts</b> meant that it was also affected. Unable to continue the battle, Duncan capitulated the next day.|$|R
50|$|The Delhi Gate (Hindustani: Dili darwaza) is an {{entrance}} to <b>the</b> Red <b>Fort</b> in Delhi {{and is on}} <b>the</b> <b>Fort's</b> southern wall. <b>The</b> gate received its name from <b>the</b> <b>Fort's</b> city. <b>The</b> primary gate is the Lahori Gate, which is very similar in appearance.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> upper <b>fort</b> (fort supérieure) is 200 m above <b>the</b> lower <b>fort.</b> Its {{location}} allows <b>the</b> upper <b>fort</b> {{to control}} <b>the</b> valley, including the railroad viaduct, {{and to protect}} <b>the</b> lower <b>fort.</b> It was built between 1834 and 1848.Today, <b>the</b> lower <b>fort</b> and <b>the</b> subterranean steps and casemates cut into the rock above it, {{up to and including}} terraces just below <b>the</b> upper <b>fort,</b> are open during the summer months for visiting, however <b>the</b> upper <b>fort</b> is not currently safe for visitors. [...] Furthermore, a moderately difficult (AD) via ferrata exists which takes climbers from <b>the</b> lower <b>fort</b> to <b>the</b> upper <b>fort</b> by traversing <b>the</b> rocky hillside. In addition, there are many hiking trails in the area which allow hikers access to <b>the</b> upper <b>fort.</b>|$|R
5|$|Benedict Arnold again led a {{fleet of}} ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt to {{recapture}} <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> in 1776. The British did recapture <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|By October 1866, {{orders were}} given to the Ordnance Sergeant at Fort Corcoran to compile a {{complete}} list of all the weapons at <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> in order to assist in their final movement to the Washington Arsenal or other permanent forts. Shortly afterward, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was dismantled and the land returned to its original owner.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed to sit at <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of}} the 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|It is thus {{likely that}} the name Petriana was a scribal error which {{confused}} <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> name and <b>the</b> occupying unit, and that <b>the</b> <b>fort's</b> true name was Uxelodunum.|$|R

50|$|Appealing to Mughal greed, Maratha forts were {{traded to}} the Mughals for large sums. Once <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> were well {{equipped}} by <b>the</b> Mughals, <b>the</b> <b>forts</b> were re-captured by Maratha forces.|$|R
5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first firing at <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of <b>the</b> <b>Fort</b> Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|E
5|$|Decommissioned in 1949, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> {{was used}} for a time as a {{storehouse}} for a shoe factory before it was purchased by the local council. The surrounding land was developed into a public park but <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> itself fell into dereliction, despite its historical and architectural significance. Since 1985 it has been leased to a voluntary preservation group, the Coalhouse Fort Project, which has been working to restore <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> and use it for heritage and educational purposes. It can be visited by the public on regular open days and houses reconstructions, small military museums and open-air displays of military equipment.

5|$|Fort Dansborg, locally called Danish Fort, is a Danish fort {{located in}} the shores of Bay of Bengal in Tharangambadi in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Fort Dansborg {{was built in the}} land ceded by Thanjavur king Ragunatha Nayak in an {{agreement}} with Danish Admiral Ove Gjedde in 1620 and acted as the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> is the second largest Danish fort after Kronborg. <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> was sold to the British in 1845 and along with Tharangambadi, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> lost its significance as the town was not an active trading post for the British. After India's independence in 1947, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of <b>the</b> <b>fort.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fort</b> is now used as a museum where the major artifacts of <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> and the Danish empire are displayed.|$|E
5|$|From July 14, 1861 to August 31, 1861, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was garrisoned by the 21st New York Volunteer Infantry. Discipline {{problems}} erupted at <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> due to {{the extension}} of the soldiers' three-month enlistments to a length of two years. A total of 41 men were convicted of dereliction of duty and imprisoned in Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas before eventually agreeing to satisfactorily complete their enlistments. In November 1861, <b>the</b> <b>fort</b> was garrisoned by men from the 14th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, commanded by a Colonel Greene. By 1863, the garrison had dwindled to a single company from that regiment.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this plan}} only applied to men manning {{the walls of}} <b>the</b> <b>fort,</b> not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort's guns.
