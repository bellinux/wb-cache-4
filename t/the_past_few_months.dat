To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E

This prompts an {{intervention}} of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty {{goes to the}} doctor's office {{in an attempt to}} obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife.|$|E

40|$|Retrospective {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{refers to}} self-reported satisfaction and emotional experience over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months.</b> Two studies investigated the mechanisms linking daily experiences to retrospective SWB. Participants reported events {{each day for}} 21 days (Study 1) {{or twice a week}} for two months (Study 2). The emotional intensity of each event was rated: (1) when it had recently occurred (proximal intensity); and (2) {{at the end of the}} event-reporting period (distal intensity). Both sets of ratings were then aggregated across events and used to predict retrospective SWB at the end of the study. Path analyses showed that proximal intensity predicted retrospective SWB whereas distal intensity did not. The effect remained even after controlling for trait happiness and neuroticism. These results suggest that daily experiences influence retrospective SWB primarily through abstract representations of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> (as measured by aggregated proximal intensity ratings) rather than the explicit recollection of individual events during the same period (as measured by aggregated distal intensity ratings). Retrospective SWB, in turn, mediated the effect of daily experiences on global SWB (i. e., self-reported satisfaction and emotional experiences in general) ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2005 a {{team from}} the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, led by Dr. René Larsen, studied the map and its {{accompanying}} manuscripts to make recommendations on {{the best ways to}} preserve the centuries-old parchment. Among other findings, this study confirmed that the two halves of the map were entirely separate, though they might have been joined in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> A <b>few</b> <b>months</b> earlier, Kirsten Seaver had suggested that a forger could have found two separate blank leaves in the original [...] "Speculum Historiale" [...] volume, from which the first few dozen pages appeared to be missing, and joined them together with the binding strip. On the other hand, at the International Conference on the History of Cartography in July 2009, Larsen revealed that his team had continued their investigation after publishing their original report, and he told the press that [...] "All the tests that we have done over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> five years — on the materials and other aspects — do not show any signs of forgery". The formal report of his presentation shows that his work ignores rather than contradicts earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the anatase in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being gneiss from the Binnenthal area of Switzerland) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that crystal size and shape should clearly distinguish commercial anatase from anatase found in sand.|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a serious}} health problem in both dogs and humans. Certain dog breeds show high prevalence of the disease, whereas other breeds are at low risk. Fructosamine and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) are two major biomarkers of glycaemia, where serum concentrations reflect glucose turnover over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> weeks to <b>months.</b> In this study, we searched for genetic factors influencing variation in serum fructosamine concentration in healthy dogs using data from nine dog breeds. Considering all breeds together, {{we did not find}} any genome-wide significant associations to fructosamine serum concentration. However, by performing breed-specific analyses we revealed an association on chromosome 3 (p corrected ≈ 1 : 68 × 10 - 6) in Belgian shepherd dogs of the Malinois subtype. The associated region and its close neighbourhood harbours interesting candidate genes such as LETM 1 and GAPDH that are important in glucose metabolism and have previously been implicated in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus. To further explore the genetics of this breed specificity, we screened the genome for reduced heterozygosity stretches private to the Belgian shepherd breed. This revealed a region with reduced heterozygosity that shows a statistically significant interaction (p = 0. 025) with the association region on chromosome 3. This region also harbours some interesting candidate genes and regulatory regions but the exact mechanisms underlying the interaction are still unknown. Nevertheless, this finding provides a plausible explanation for breed-specific genetic effects for complex traits in dogs. Shepherd breeds are at low risk of developing diabetes mellitus. The findings in Belgian shepherds could be connected to a protective mechanism against the disease. Further insight into the regulation of glucose metabolism could improve diagnostic and therapeutic methods for diabetes mellitus. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study aims to {{identify}} the reasons why enrolled people decide not to renew their membership in following years. Methods Household survey is used to collect information on the factors influencing dropping out from community-based health insurance (CBI). Information from CBI agency databank is {{used to describe the}} general situation of enrolment and drop-out. Results Since the launch of CBI the enrolment rate has been low ranging from 5. 2 % to 6. 3 %. The drop-out rate, however, has been high ranging from 30. 9 % to 45. 7 %. It is found, by the multivariate analysis, that female household head, higher age or lower education of a household head, lower number of illness episodes in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three <b>months,</b> <b>fewer</b> children or elderly in a household, poor perceived health care quality, less seeking care in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> month positively effected on drop-out, increasing the rate. However, the household six-month expenditure and the distance to the contracted health facility did not have the hypothesised sign. In contrast, a higher household expenditure and a shorter distance to the contracted health facility increased the drop-out. Conclusions High drop-out rates endanger the sustainability of CBI not only because they reduce the size of the insurance pool, but also because they bear a negative impact on further enrolment and drop-out. The drop-out rate in the scheme of the Nouna Health District, Burkina Faso, is very high. The reasons for drop-out may be related to affordability, health-needs and health demand, quality of care, household head and household characteristics. This study represents a valuable attempt towards further increasing the sustainability of CBI schemes, by understanding not what motivates people to first enrol in CBI, but what motivates them to renew membership year after year.

40|$|How can {{a person}} judge another individual’s moral character? One way {{may be to}} look to their moral and immoral actions. However, should all actions be weighed equally, whether they {{occurred}} in the near or distant past? Moral actions do not occur in a temporal vacuum, yet relatively little research has examined the role of time in moral judgment. We expected that people would weigh a previous immoral act differently depending on when it occurred and on their beliefs about personal malleability. Individuals differ in their implicit theories about {{the degree to which}} human characteristics, such as moral character or personality, are malleable (Dweck, Chiu, 2 ̆ 6 Hong, 1995). Entity theorists believe that personal characteristics remain stable and fixed throughout one’s life, while incremental theorists believe that these characteristics can change over time. We predicted that incremental theorists would attenuate harsh moral judgments to a greater degree with the passage of time. We also expected that motivated reasoning could influence moral judgments, and examined this by varying race of the offender and assessing prejudice levels. Three studies were designed to examine how implicit theories about personal mutability, time, and offender race affect moral judgments. Participants read about an offender’s past commission of a crime. In Study 1, incremental theorists were more forgiving of the offender and held less punitive beliefs regardless of time (3 or 10 years ago), and that modern racism predicted negative reactions to offenders perceived as Black (but not White), greater subjective recency, and a tendency to shift to a more entity perspective. Study 2 attempted to manipulate offender race, but was unable to do so effectively. In Study 3, offenders who committed crimes in <b>the</b> distant <b>past</b> (3 and 10 years) were judged more positively than those from <b>the</b> recent <b>past</b> (a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> ago), and preliminary evidence that incremental theorists are more positive towards the offender than entity theorists in the distant (but not recent) condition. After using a more overt race manipulation, however, modern racism did not systematically predict judgments about a Black offender, nor did it predict shifts in implicit theories...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Unhealthy {{alcohol use}} is a {{substantial}} problem among college students {{and can lead to}} a variety of negative consequences. Commercially available web-based brief alcohol intervention (WBI) programs have demonstrated efficacy in a range of student groups and have been widely disseminated to colleges to address this issue. However, the majority of published WBI studies required participants to complete baseline research assessments (RA) about their alcohol use before the WBI and reactivity to the RA may have inflated WBI efficacy estimates in these studies. The present study tested whether there was an additive effect of RA administered online plus a WBI on alcohol consumption, alcohol consequences, and protective behaviors related to alcohol used in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> month compared to the effects of only a WBI. It was hypothesized that participants randomized to the RA+WBI condition would have significantly lower alcohol consumption in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>month,</b> <b>fewer</b> alcohol-related problems, and use more protective behaviors related to alcohol consumption in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> month than participants randomized to the WBI only condition. Methods: Undergraduate students (n= 856) from universities in the United States and Canada were recruited for this online study. Seventy percent of the sample was female and 82 % were Caucasian. The sample had a mean age was 20. 0. Sixty four percent (n= 547) of participants who were randomized completed the WBI. Sixty-eight percent completed the one month follow up questionnaire. Results: Multiple regression analyses using 20 multiply imputed datasets revealed that {{there were no significant differences}} in groups at follow up on alcohol use measures, alcohol related problems, or protective behaviors used when controlling for variables with theoretical and statistical relevance to the models. A repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that there was a significant decrease in peak estimated blood alcohol concentration from baseline to follow up, but no differential effect by randomization group. The results suggested there was a moderate effect of the WBI consistent with studies of WBI efficacy in the literature and that there were no substantial assessment reactivity effects. Discussion: The current study contributes to the literature by identifying an experimental condition under which assessment reactivity may not be present and does not appear to cloud the detection of WBI efficacy when measured within subjects. The results indicate that WBI researchers may be justified in conducting brief pretreatment research assessments online to collect information about participant alcohol use without biasing within subjects estimates of WBI efficacy. Universities using these programs may likely observe similar effect sizes to those reported in the literature, however effectiveness studies are warranted...|$|R
