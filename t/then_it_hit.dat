60|$|Half {{a minute}} after the train dropped this desolate, hardly {{controlled}} beach it raced through {{four or five}} miles of the suburbs of Patna, but a clean and glorified Patna bowered in bamboo plantations. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> a tunnel and sailed forth into {{a section of the}} London, Brighton, and South Coast, or whatever the line is that wants to make the Channel tunnel. At any rate, the embankment was on the beach, and the waves lapped the foot of it, and there was a wall of cut rock to landward. Then we disturbed many villages of fishermen, whose verandahs gave on to the track, and whose nets lay almost under our wheels. The railway was still a new thing in that particular part of the world, for mothers held up their babes to see it.|$|E

50|$|Artists of Ando’s breed are rare. His art is {{like the}} surface of an angry sea, it comes up on you fast and unexpected. It sneaks up on you. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> you. <b>It</b> is big and visceral and it shouts at you. The art is {{extremely}} powerful. The art is for everyone, yet only visual artists who work in such volumes would really know what the depth of this art means or where it goes into the psyche.|$|R

50|$|The {{lower the}} ball {{comes at the}} volleyer, the harder <b>it</b> is to <b>hit</b> an {{effective}} volley. In some cases, a player is better off to let the ball bounce rather than attempt to volley <b>it,</b> <b>then</b> <b>hit</b> <b>it</b> on the rise right after the bounce. This is called a half volley (although technically {{it is not a}} volley) {{and is one of the}} most difficult shots in tennis; John McEnroe, Patrick Rafter and Leander Paes were considered masters of it.|$|R

I always thought how they’d say “Hawk!” and “Dove!” and transform was really cool. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> me: The mysterious voice that gave Hawk and Dove their powers could easily give the Dove powers to someone else! Maybe… a woman! I called Barbara as soon as I could. She sparked off the idea instantly and before even we knew it, we were co-writers.|$|E

The keeper got a hand on it, but <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> another girl's chest, and it was bobbling around, and I just hit it in. It feels great, especially since it helped get us the (regular season) title. I'm very excited. There's a good energy amongst the team, and we're feeling good going into playoffs." ...|$|E
50|$|So {{the first}} hook and verse {{is from the}} {{perspective}} of someone who is calling the hotline and they want to commit suicide. They want to kill themselves. They want to end their life. When I jumped on a tour bus that started in Los Angeles, California and I ended in New York City and did a fan tour where I went to fan’s houses and shared meals with them, hung out with them, played them my album before it came out. Them along with other people on tour, just fans that I met randomly, they’ve said things like, “Your music has saved my life. You’ve saved my life.” And I was always like, “Aw so nice of you. Thanks.” And I give them a hug and shit but in my mind, I’m like, “What the fuck?” And they’re really serious. And they tat shit on their arms and get shit like lyrics that save their life and in my mind, I was like, “Man I wasn’t even trying to save nobody’s life.” And <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> me, the power that I have as an artist with a voice. I wasn’t even trying to save your life. Now what can happen if I actually did?.|$|E

So he draws a SNOWSTORM and the whole world is snowed in. No one can get to school - or {{anywhere}} else for that matter. It's all good until he realizes that if he can't get out of the house, neither can anyone else. Cabin Fever soon results and Zeke is now surrounded by his shivering, hungry and very unhappy family. Zeke has {{to get rid of this}} snow and fast! When the PAD is finally recharged Zeke immediately draws a sunny day to melt all the snow. But instead of returning the world to a normal state Zeke has created a tornado which rips the house from its foundation and lands it in a desert! Oops, that's a little sunnier than Zeke had intended. Now Zeke must try and remember what he learned in science class so he and his family can survive in this hostile environment. Ironic, yes?

5000|$|At that time, Soviet {{research}} was not organized on a sufficiently high level, and useful results were not obtained, although radiochemical analyses of samples of fallout could have provided some useful {{information about the}} materials used to produce the explosion. The relationship between certain short-lived isotopes formed {{in the course of}} thermonuclear reactions could have made it possible to judge the degree of compression of the thermonuclear fuel, but knowing the degree of compression would not have allowed Soviet scientists to conclude exactly how the exploded device had been made, and it would not have revealed its design.Sakharov stated in his memoirs that though he and Davidenko had fallout dust in cardboard boxes several days after the [...] "Mike" [...] test with the hope of analyzing it for information, a chemist at Arzamas-16 (the Soviet weapons laboratory) had mistakenly poured the concentrate down the drain before it could be analyzed. Only in the fall of 1952 did the Soviet Union set up an organized system for monitoring fallout data. Nonetheless, the memoirs also say that the yield from one of the American tests, which became an international incident, involving Japan, told Sakharov that the US design was much better than theirs, and he decided that they must have exploded a separate fission bomb and somehow used its energy to compress the lithium deuteride. But how, he asked himself, can an explosion to one side be used to compress the ball of fusion fuel within 5% of symmetry? <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> him! Focus the X-rays! ...|$|E

This man had been so fucked that when they grabbed his foot through the cell bars he began screaming and crying. After praying to Allah he moans a constant short Ah, Ah every few seconds {{for the rest of the}} night. I don't know what they did to this guy. The first one remained handcuffed for maybe 1 ½-2 hours until he started yelling for Allah. So they went back in and handcuffed him to the top bunk on either side of the bed while he stood on the side. He was there for a little over an hour when he started yelling again for Allah. Not many people know this shit goes on. The only reason I want to be there is to get the pictures and prove that the US is not what they think. But I don't know if I can take it mentally. What if that was me in their shoes. These people will be our future terrorist. Kelly, its awful and you know how fucked I am in the head. Both sides of me think its wrong. I thought I could handle anything. I was wrong. Sabrina ...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Last December an 8 -second amateur video went viral. Shot {{in remote}} {{northern}} Tasmania, the blurry footage featured a long-tailed mammal trotting across a meadow with an oddly stilted gait. According to the film-maker, Murray McAllister, {{the animal was}} a Tasmanian tiger. The Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, is a wolf-sized marsupial predator that has been presumed extinct since the last known specimen died in Hobart zoo in 1936. Yet despite its apparent demise, reports of Tassie tigers refuse to die. Hundreds of sightings, many from seemingly credible observers, have been recorded, both in Tasmania and on the mainland. When I saw the video there was something vaguely familiar about it. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> me: the animal moved like a red fox. I'd raised a fox as a boy in the western US, {{and they have a}} peculiar way of trotting. Soon, others were saying the same thing. Then a faecal sample McAllister collected was analysed for its DNA: it was a red fox...|$|E
