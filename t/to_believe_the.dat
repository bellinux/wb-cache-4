5|$|French and British patrol frigates each {{spotted the}} other's fleet around 9:30 am; both at first underestimated {{the size of}} the other fleet, leading each {{commander}} <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> other fleet was the smaller fleet of Admiral de Barras. When the true size of the fleets became apparent, Graves assumed that de Grasse and Barras had already joined forces, and prepared for battle; he directed his line toward the bay's mouth, assisted by winds from the north-northeast.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E
5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E

5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
5|$|Lad {{is accused}} of killing eight sheep owned by a neighbor.

The Master {{successfully}} shows the improbability of a single dog carrying off six sheep in two nights and that the two dead sheep left behind were clearly cut with a knife, not teeth. After Lad is given a 24-hour parole, the Master asks the judge to accompany him to the neighbor's house that night, where they discover that the farmhand was actually stealing the sheep, then killing one from each batch to put the blame on Lad.|$|E

Several days later, Scully and her partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) discuss the case in Mulder's office at FBI headquarters. Mulder relates that the case {{seems to be the}} work of a repeat offender, and there is reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> couple will be killed in a matter of days. He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs (Brad Dourif), a serial killer he had helped to {{apprehend}} years before, has claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and has offered to help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted. Mulder is unusually skeptical about Boggs' claims.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> United States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if the United States had made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E

Doggett and Reyes turn to The Lone Gunmen when Fletcher provides an alleged photo of the super soldier, whom The Lone Gunmen recognize as Yves Adele Harlow (Zuleikha Robinson), a fellow hacker who went missing a year ago. The Gunmen refuse <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> evidence, especially when they find that Fletcher provided it, although the agents continue to pursue the trail.|$|E

John was indeed able to see Manuel in private and offered him the Emperor's pardon, which Manuel seemed to accept, although for the time being, Manuel remained publicly loyal to his Abbasid allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Writing was {{physically}} introduced to Japan from China {{in the form}} of inscribed artefacts {{at the beginning of the}} Christian era. Examples, some of which have been designated as archaeological National Treasures, include coins of the reign of Wang Mang (AD 8–25), a 1st-century gold seal from Shikanoshima, a late 2nd century iron sword from the Tōdaijiyama burial mound, the Seven-Branched Sword with inscription from 369 and a large number of bronze mirrors—the oldest dating to the 3rd century. All of these artefacts originated on the continent, most likely in China. However, the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have been mistaken for decorations by the Japanese. When the Japanese later manufactured locally copies of original Chinese mirrors, they may have continued <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> written inscriptions to be merely decorative.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E

5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
5|$|Egan's own {{research}} into the issue showed that the trustees had conveyed St. Mary's Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but the trustees did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished {{their role in the}} church's leadership. By 1811, Egan's worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary's, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and the trustees became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the War of 1812. Egan also came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan's own and by the younger Harold's scheming to be named Egan's coadjutor bishop. He appealed to the trustees for compromise, and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and the trustees had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that Téa's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E
