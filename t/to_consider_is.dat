5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to {{data storage}} and/or on-screen space), achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and different cultural expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget and schedule. Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few titles, like The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English first and then adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the international market.|$|E
25|$|Add to {{this the}} lower cost of {{maintaining}} the engine and the lower amount of {{wear and tear on}} the track. Another fact <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> that many tank locomotives were bought from former industrial railways rather than the national network. Due to the higher availability, {{it would be easier to}} secure a suitable locomotive for a reasonable price.|$|E
25|$|For dogs living in/visiting {{rural areas}} or areas frequented by wildlife, another {{important}} vaccine is <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> against Leptospirosis, a disease characterized by weakness, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and kidney and liver failure. Leptospirosis comes from standing water containing urine from animals infected with leptospira, and the disease {{can be transmitted}} to humans via contaminated water or food.|$|E

25|$|Free radical {{halogenation}} typically {{produces a}} mixture of compounds mono- or multihalogenated at various positions. It is possible to predict {{the results of a}} halogenation reaction based on bond dissociation energies and the relative stabilities of the radical intermediates. Another factor <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> the probability of reaction at each carbon atom, from a statistical point of view.|$|E
25|$|Once {{infrastructure}} is in place, operating {{water supply and}} sanitation systems entails significant ongoing costs to cover personnel, energy, chemicals, maintenance and other expenses. The sources of money to meet these capital and operational costs are essentially either user fees, public funds or some combination of the two. An increasing dimension <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> the flexibility of the water supply system.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} point <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would also benefit from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, {{they are likely to}} compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that weedkillers could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} point <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> that Tolkowsky {{did not follow}} {{the path of a}} ray that was reflected more than twice in the diamond. However, we now know that a diamond's appearance is composed of many light paths that reflect considerably more than two times within that diamond. Once again, we can see that Tolkowsky's predictions are helpful in explaining optimal diamond performance, but they are incomplete by today's technological standards.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} factor <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> the {{individual differences in}} the experience of pleasurable effects brought on by the substance or behaviour. It is reasoned that certain individuals may be more sensitive to the pleasurable effects and thus experience them with greater intensity, resulting in addiction. For example, over-responsiveness to substance affects has been found in cocaine addicts – an increased response to methylphenidate in the brain regions associated with emotional reactivity and mood. Thus, strong emotional responses that addicted individuals show in response to substances or behaviours might be results of enhanced sensitivity to their effects.|$|E
25|$|Another issue <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> {{the freedom}} of the migrants. Some {{scholars}} have questioned whether these workers are moving into a state of “unfreedom”. Recruitment into circular migration may involve false promises and deception, leading to forced labor and debt bondage. Migrants have varying degrees of control concerning the choice and circumstances of migration, thus making the distinction between voluntary and forced migration unclear. Once in their destination country, migrants are sometimes met with abusive treatment, inadequate nutrition, poor lodging, and insufficient food. These factors are unlikely to bring a worker back to that area, thus discouraging circular migration. This dishonest recruitment leads {{to the question of whether}} the migrants are marginalized. Circular migrants are marginal in the area of destination in the sense that their true home is back in their home area, and they do not plan on living in the host area permanently.|$|E

25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} {{analysis}} of the scientific revolution during this period, there has been criticism of not only the Eurocentric ideologies spread, {{but also of the}} dominance of male scientists of the time. Science as we know it today, and the original theories that we base modern science on, was built by males, regardless of the input women might have made. The incorporation of women's work in the sciences during this time tends to be obscured. Scholars have tried to look into the participation of women in the 17th century in science, and even with sciences as simple as domestic knowledge women were making advances. With the limited history provided from texts of the period we are not completely aware if women were helping these scientists develop the ideas they did. Another idea <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> the way this period influenced even the women scientists of the periods following it. Annie Jump Cannon was an astronomer who benefitted from the laws and theories developed from this period; she made several advances in the century following the scientific revolution. It was an important period for the future of science, including the incorporation of women into fields using the developments made.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{investment}} {{may have}} been discouraged by the high initial cost of building a very large novel structure, the large land area required and by the risk of investment, however, {{there appears to be}} a renewed interest in solar updraft towers especially in sunny remote areas. A few prototypes have recently been constructed and projects are being proposed for parts of Africa, USA and Australia. An important fact <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> that solar updraft towers appear to be the only renewable energy technology that can generate electricity from low temperature heat. [...] Functional or mechanical feasibility is not so much an issue now as capitalisation.|$|E
2500|$|Another thing <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} motion of the Moon is not a perfect circle. [...] Its orbit is {{distinctly}} elliptic, so the lunar distance from Earth varies throughout the lunar cycle. This varying distance changes the apparent diameter of the Moon, and therefore influences the chances, duration, and type (partial, annular, total, mixed) of an eclipse. [...] This orbital period is called the anomalistic month, and together with the synodic month causes the so-called [...] "full moon cycle" [...] of about 14 lunations in the timings and appearances of full (and new) Moons. The Moon moves faster when it is closer to the Earth (near perigee) and slower when it is near apogee (furthest distance), thus periodically changing the timing of syzygies by up to ±14 hours (relative to their mean timing), and changing the apparent lunar angular diameter by about ±6%. [...] An eclipse cycle must comprise close to an integer number of anomalistic months in order to perform well in predicting eclipses.|$|E
2500|$|Discussions over value {{are common}} in studies on organ gifting. As Lock has indicated, {{the main reason for}} this is that [...] "human body parts do not have {{universal}} value, and once, potentially available for conversion into circulating commodities, their worth, and more basically the question of whether or not they are alienable, is open to dispute". An important factor <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>is</b> the fact that organ gifting differs from the gifting of blood or semen in the sense that organs are scarce. It is this scarcity which creates stronger relationships between the giver and the receiver because it endows the object that is being transferred with greater value. As Appadurai (1986) has indicated, the link between exchange and value is created by politics, thus making value an issue of judgment. In the case of organ exchange, when the demand, whether real or fictitious, exceeds the supply, the object is endowed with greater value. In other words, objects can be controlled to create value. Several authors have examined the issue of organ scarcity pointing to the different ways in which it is publicly exacerbated for profit-driven interests.|$|E
