5|$|Embroidery styles for smock-frocks {{varied by}} region, {{and a number}} of motifs became {{traditional}} for various occupations: wheel-shapes for carters and wagoners, sheep and crooks for shepherds, and so on. Most of this embroidery was done in heavy linen thread, often in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the smock.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the outside was made from a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E

50|$|The {{club was}} founded on March 27, 1995, as an amateur team by the fathers of the youngsters playing in the Escolinha de Futebol Peraltinha youth academy. As the youth academy had a {{partnership}} with Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, they adopted <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>colors</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Minas Gerais-based club and Assis municipality flag. Assisense then adopted <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>colors</b> <b>as</b> Cruzeiro and <b>the</b> youth academy. The club professionalized its football department in 2003, competing in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year in <b>the</b> Campeonato Paulista Série B3.|$|R

5|$|Ikaruga is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure. It is the spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The game's story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using {{a specially designed}} fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanic is the game's key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.|$|E
5|$|Later in the game, non-rotatable gems can be found, and {{the player}} is punished for {{rotations}} {{that do not}} lead to a match by having the enemy's gauge fill faster. The amount of damage that the player can take or deliver is dependent on the monster used in battle, and using a beast in battle earns experience points which can increase the power of that summon. Each monster has a corresponding color, and matching gems that are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> your chosen monster or the enemy makes your gauge fill faster or theirs slower. Enemy monsters can change gems on the board to skulls, which cause damage to the player if they are not lined up within a certain number of moves. After being defeated in a battle, enemy monsters are added to the list of creatures that the player chooses from when they start a stage. New monsters can also be found hidden in the stages, along with items that can be used during battles.|$|E
5|$|Other {{lavender}} to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides, {{which is}} so multiply branched so as to appear toothed, and Clavulina amethystina, {{which can only be}} reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species. In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the rest of the fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than —could be mistaken for a small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E

5|$|Sevastopol {{began her}} sea trials on 16 October 1899, and was {{commissioned}} after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy. She {{and her sister}} ships were transferred to Port Arthur, which was then the port of the First Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet. In September 1900, Popov radios were installed on Sevastopol and her sister Poltava, the first Russian battleships to have them. They were also painted white, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron. She then left for Port Arthur and arrived at on 13 April 1901. As Russia was not at war with any Far East countries at that time, Sevastopol stayed in port, inactive.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is a {{medium-sized}} rodent that looks {{much like the}} common black and brown rats, but has greater differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The fur is thick and short. The upperparts are generally gray to grayish brown, with the head a bit lighter, and are sharply delimited from the underparts, which are off-white, as are the feet. It has small cheek pouches. The ears are about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the upperparts, but a patch of light hairs {{is in front of}} them. The tail is dark brown above and may be paler below. The guard hairs are long and have unpigmented, silvery tips. When rice rats swim, air is trapped in the fur, which increases buoyancy and reduces heat loss. As in most other oryzomyines, females have eight mammae.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E

25|$|Tinamous are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} skyward allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe often enough to tint themselves <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} FK Vojvodina began as {{the brainchild of}} a circle from the Novi Sad aristocracy. FK Vojvodina's team colors were {{inspired}} by SK Slavia Prague, and the two teams still share <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>colors</b> <b>as</b> of 2015.|$|R

50|$|Sealand's kit has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>colors</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> flag of Sealand. Their {{original}} kit {{consisted of}} a red shirt with white trim, black shorts and white socks, and was provided by JJB with sponsorship from UK investment firm Property Secrets.|$|R
25|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{floating}} fabric was attached to a 30.5centimeter (12inch) diameter octagonal boom, in sections, of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the fabric. The boom was connected to the radial anchor lines, which extended from the anchors at the island to the 610 specially made anchors, spaced at 15.3meter (50ft) intervals, 76meters (250ft) beyond the perimeter of each island, driven into the limestone {{at the bottom of the}} Bay. Earth anchors were driven into the land, near the foot of the trees, to secure the inland edge of the fabric, covering the surface of the beach and disappearing under the vegetation.|$|E
25|$|For Major League baseball, the Metrodome {{was widely}} {{thought of as}} a hitter's park, with a low (7ft) left-field fence (343ft) that favored {{right-handed}} power hitters, and the higher (23ft) but closer (327ft) right-field Baggie that favored left-handed power hitters. Because the roof is very nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> a baseball, and transmits light, the Metrodome had a far higher error incidence than a normal stadium during day games, so instead of losing a fly ball in the sun, as is common for non-roofed stadiums, fly balls could easily get lost in the ceiling. Unlike most parks built during this time, Metrodome's baseball configuration had asymmetrical outfield dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Two figures hold a {{shrouded}} corpse, {{which is}} also surrounded by flames. The hands of the corpse are folded, but above the corpse, a figure resembling a fetus emerges. That Xul uses a fetus instead of {{an image of a}} deceased person of typical age leads one to read the image as a depiction of reincarnation, representing a break from traditional Catholic ideas of life and death, and demonstrating the investigation into disparate spiritualities which would continue for the rest of Xul's life. As the figures recede in the painting, Xul reduces them to geometric shapes. The forms cease to be recognizable as beings, and then are transformed into what can be a tomb, or portal. That all the mourners are of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the temple indicates that they, just like the deceased, will make the same transition someday.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, the Golden Dawn's meander symbol, while {{a symbol}} drawn from Greek art (which the party sees as {{representing}} bravery and eternal struggle) uses <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>colors</b> <b>as</b> Hitler's NSDAP flag: a red background, a black meander (respectively swastika) {{and a white}} surrounding.|$|R
50|$|The Cracker-Cats {{moved to}} the Golden Baseball League in 2008 and were sold to Daryl Katz, {{the owner of the}} Edmonton Oilers, in 2009. The team adopted the name Capitals after Katz's {{purchase}} and also adopted <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>colors</b> <b>as</b> their corporate sibling.|$|R

25|$|Police then {{compared}} the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's {{body to the}} ones in Buell's van, which was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> the one seen in 1982. The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed {{that they had been}} replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Robert Anthony Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{chromatic}} number of the plane {{must be at least}} four follows from the existence of a seven-vertex unit distance graph with chromatic number four, named the Moser spindle after its discovery in 1961 by the brothers William and Leo Moser. This graph consists of two unit equilateral triangles joined at a common vertexx. Each of these triangles is joined along another edge to another equilateral triangle; the vertices y and z of these joined triangles are at unit distance from each other. If the plane could be three-colored, the coloring within the triangles would force y and z to both have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> x, but then, since y and z are at unit distance from each other, we would not have a proper coloring of the unit distance graph of the plane. Therefore, at least four colors are needed to color this graph and the plane containing it. An alternative lower bound {{in the form of a}} ten-vertex four-chromatic unit distance graph was discovered at around the same time by Solomon W. Golomb.|$|E
25|$|To {{investigate}} {{if people}} would help {{others in the}} presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue, van Bommel set out to perform two experiments. For the first experiment, participants were invited to join an online forum. A sample of 86 students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names of the other people that were online in the left upper half of the screen. To operationalize the accountability cue, participants' names were displayed in either red or black. Red (salient condition), utilized to attract attention and stand out, was used to raise public self-awareness while black (non-salient) was used for participants to have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>color</b> <b>as</b> other bystanders. In random order, five different messages were presented to the participants. Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress. The number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants and as expected, the results showed that names in black (non-salient condition) were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being 2. However, when names were in the red (salient condition), the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being 3. This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect.|$|E
