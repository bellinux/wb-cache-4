50|$|Versions of the Rolls-Royce Avon {{turbojet}} engine used a geared <b>turbine</b> <b>starter</b> motor that burned isopropyl nitrate as the fuel. In military service this monofuel had the NATO designation of S-746 AVPIN. For starting a measured amount of fuel {{was introduced to}} the starter combustion chamber then ignited electrically, the hot gases spinning the turbine at high revolutions with the exhaust exiting overboard.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>turbine</b> <b>starter</b> {{system is}} almost {{exactly like a}} little engine. Again the turbine is {{connected}} to the engine via gears. However, the turbine is turned by burning gases - usually the fuel is isopropyl nitrate (or sometimes Hydrazine) stored in a tank and sprayed into a combustion chamber. Again, it is ignited with a spark plug. Everything is electrically controlled, such as speed, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{military}} aircraft {{need to be}} started quicker than the electric method permits and hence they use other methods such as a cartridge <b>turbine</b> <b>starter</b> or [...] "cart starter". This is an impulse turbine impacted by burning gases from a cartridge, usually created by igniting a solid propellant similar to gunpowder. It is geared to rotate the engine and also connected to an automatic disconnect system, or overrunning clutch. The cartridge is set alight electrically and used to turn the starter's turbine.|$|E
40|$|A {{software}} {{was developed for}} estimating the overall design layout details of gas <b>turbine</b> engine <b>starter.</b> Using this software {{the weight of a}} gas <b>turbine</b> engine <b>starter</b> to develop a power of 96 KW was calculated for different combinations of compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperatures. The weight estimation of the gas <b>turbine</b> engine <b>starter</b> was validated with the weights of the commercially available starters. For three commercially available starters supplied by the sponsorer the off-design performance were predicted at different flight and altitude condition. These three commercial starter performance were compared. This software package {{can be used as a}} preliminary tool to asses the performance of gas <b>turbine</b> engine <b>starters...</b>|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{electric}} starters, air-starters have {{a higher}} power-to-weight ratio. Electric starters and their wiring can become excessively hot if it takes longer than expected to start the engine, while air-starters can be run {{as long as their}} air supply lasts. <b>Turbine</b> <b>starters</b> are much simpler and are a natural fit for turbine engines, and thus are used extensively on large turbofan engines used on commercial and military aircraft.|$|R
40|$|A {{consortium}} {{has been}} formed to address seal {{problems in the}} Aerospace sector of Allied Signal, Inc. The consortium is represented by makers of Propulsion Engines, Auxiliary Power Units, Gas <b>Turbine</b> <b>Starters,</b> etc. The goal is to improve Face Seal reliability, since Face Seals have become reliability drivers in many of our product lines. Several research programs are being implemented simultaneously this year. They include: Face Seal Modeling and Analysis Methodology; Oil Cooling of Seals; Seal Tracking Dynamics; Coking Formation & Prevention; and Seal Reliability Methods...|$|R
5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb labyrinth seals {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant. The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal. If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core. Air <b>turbine</b> <b>starter</b> (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 kn but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent. Since they were too high for an APU start, the ram air turbine (known as an [...] "air-driven generator" [...] on Bombardier products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned oxygen masks, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.|$|E
40|$|A failed bolt from Air <b>Turbine</b> <b>Starter</b> (ATS) was {{forwarded}} to the laboratory for analysis {{to ascertain the}} cause of failure. Analysis showed that the ATS bolt had fractured at the shank region by stress corrosion cracking. Semiquantitative chemical analysis carried out on the bolt surface indicated presence of substantial quantity of sodium and chlorine. The source of these corrosive elements could {{be traced to the}} etchant that was used to engrave the identification number on the shank of the bolts...|$|E
40|$|A {{fractured}} Air <b>Turbine</b> <b>Starter</b> (ATS) {{quill shaft}} was forwarded to the laboratory for analysis. The ATS quill shaft was found fractured by torsional overload. It {{appears that the}} rotation of the quill shaft at the driven end was restricted resulting in overload on the shaft. The ATS system may be examined to establish the cause for such restriction. Chemical analysis by EDX showed that the shaft was made of Cr-Mo-V steel and had a hardness of about RC 54...|$|E
40|$|Harnessing {{energy at}} micro-scale from high energy sources has gained {{significance}} {{in recent times}} for space propulsion and other applications. Conventional solid rocket propellants have advantages {{in terms of being}} efficient, compact and safe to handle, though with much lower regression rates as compared to solid explosives. An approach to high regression rates in composite propellants is demonstrated in the present work by the enhancement of fuel-oxidiser interaction, and by the incorporation of micro-scale porosity into the propellant grain. The porous polystyrene-ammonium perchlorate grain designed in this work, based on electrospun micro-fibres and aqueous impregnation, exhibits burning rates more than 25 times as compared to the non-porous grain. Such high regression rates using insensitive propellant compositions have practical implications in the development of micro-thrusters, and in gas generating devices such as MAV launch systems and <b>turbine</b> <b>starters.</b> Detailed preparatory procedure, characterisation techniques, and flame regression studies are included in this paper...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} presented to determine the aerodynamic performance deficit of a 13. 5 - centimeter-tip-diameter aircraft engine <b>starter</b> <b>turbine.</b> The two-phased evaluation comprised both the stator and the stage performance, and the experimental design is described in detail. Data obtained from the investigation of three honeycomb shrouds clearly showed that the filled honeycomb reached a total efficiency of 0. 868, 8. 2 points higher than the open honeycomb shroud, at design equivalent conditions of speed and blade-jet speed ratio. It was concluded {{that the use of}} an open honeycomb shroud caused the large performance deficit for the <b>starter</b> <b>turbine.</b> Further research is suggested to ascertain stator inlet boundary layer measurements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAerospace system {{requirements}} {{over the last}} decade have continued to evolve toward higher levels of performance at lower cost, incurring a major challenge for system developers; how to balance conflicting performance and cost requirements and understand their impact on performance margins as well as the manufacturability characteristics of the design. This paper presents results of a case study performed on an aerospace air <b>turbine</b> <b>starter</b> system in which a top-level systems engineering methodology has been developed to help understand the impact that customer requirements and design decisions have on manufacturing trade space constraints. One of the major findings of this case study is that incremental increases in performance requirements can drive step change increases in manufacturing cost due to discontinuities in the material and process trade space, i. e. using titanium versus aluminum to meet temperature requirements or having to use investment versus sand castings to meet minimum thickness and tolerance requirements. Internally developed quantitative producibility analysis tools are also used to characterize the complexity and Design for Manufacturability (DFM) characteristics of the “similar to” baseline design to identify producibility improvement opportunities for the new design as part of the proposed systems engineering process to mitigate design reuse risks...|$|E
5000|$|The pre-positioning of this {{ordnance}} was {{the basis}} for one of the [...] "worst disasters in Air Force history". On 16 May 1965, while waiting to takeoff on a mission, a B-57B exploded on the ground at Bien Hoa AB. The B-57 was started with a black powder cartridge that fired when the pilot hit the starter switch, causing a small <b>starter</b> <b>turbine</b> to spin. These turbines sometimes spun loose and flew out of the starter housing. On this day, a loose turbine hit the fuse of an armed 500 lb bomb, setting off a whole chain of secondary explosions.|$|R
40|$|The {{reasons for}} the low {{aerodynamic}} performance of a 13. 5 cm tip diameter aircraft engine <b>starter</b> <b>turbine</b> were investigated. Both the stator and the stage were evaluated. Approximately 10 percent improvement in turbine efficiency was obtained when the honeycomb shroud over the rotor blade tips was filled to obtain a solid shroud surface. Efficiency improvements were obtained for three rotor configurations when the shroud was filled. It is suggested that the large loss associated with the open honeycomb shroud is due primarily to energy loss associated with gas transportation {{as a result of}} the blade to blade pressure differential at the tip section...|$|R
50|$|Following {{an inquiry}} by the Air Accident Investigation Branch and the RAF, it was {{determined}} that the DC loom on the aircraft's Number 4 engine had somehow sustained damage prior to the flight. An arc occurred when the anti-icing system was turned on, which led to the engine air start sequence initiating. The engine was running idle as part of the testing regime during the flight, so when the <b>starter</b> <b>turbine</b> ran up to high speed, it caused a structural failure that led to the turbine disc puncturing one of the fuel tanks. The fuel leak was subsequently ignited, either by the high engine temperature, or the arc from the faulty loom.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 {{kilometers}} from the airport, the engine starter no. 2 [...] "collapsed". According to investigators, the destruction was caused due to foreign objects. A foreign object, presumably a fragment of the casing of the APU gas collector which was located under the control flap of the starter, entered the engine and sliced the fuel lines, hydraulic lines and oil lines. The tightly closed damper of the <b>turbine</b> of tha <b>starter</b> continued to untwist during its take-off, which caused the detachement. Added by {{the operation of the}} engine, which was operating over its permitted maximum rpm, this caused the destruction of the engine which led to the subsequent fire and loss of control.|$|R
50|$|All {{versions}} of the engine consist of two sections {{that can be easily}} separated for maintenance: a gas generator supplies hot gas to a free power <b>turbine.</b> The <b>starter</b> has to accelerate only the gas generator, making the engine easy to start, particularly in cold weather. Air enters the gas-generator through an inlet screen into the low-pressure axial compressor. This has three stages on small and medium {{versions of}} the engine and four stages on large versions. The air then flows into a single-stage centrifugal compressor, through a folded annular combustion chamber, and finally through a single-stage turbine that powers the compressors at about 45,000 rpm. Hot gas from the gas generator flows into the power turbine, which turns at about 30,000 rpm. It has one stage on the small engines and two stages on the medium and large ones. For turboprop use, this powers a two-stage planetary output reduction gearbox, which turns the propeller at a speed of 1,900 to 2,200 rpm. The exhaust gas then escapes through two side-mounted ducts in the power turbine housing. The turbines are mounted inside the combustion chamber, reducing overall length.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{reports on}} the {{investigation}} and development of flywheel technology as energy storage for shipboard zonal power systems. The goal was to determine where energy storage devices could improve operation and/or reduce life-cycle maintenance costs. Applications where energy storage can provide benefits include uninterruptible power to essential loads, “dark ” start capability, load leveling, system stability and pulse weapons. A Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS), with 25 kWh of available energy, will be presented {{as an alternative to}} the current shipboard electrochemical battery system, highlighting the advantages for and challenges presented by shipboard applications. Flywheel technology overcomes some of the shortcomings of today’s energy storage systems by having an extremely high cyclic-life, limited temperature sensitivity, no chemical hazards, charge rate equal to discharge, and reduced weight and space. As Gas <b>Turbine</b> Electric <b>Starter</b> development enters into fleet evaluation, FESS may provide dark ship start capability more so than any other systems being investigated. This paper discusses the critical technical challenges of the FESS for shipboard systems, and the steps for future development.
