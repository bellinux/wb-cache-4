5|$|Ripley, Lambert, and Parker {{agree to}} self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in the shuttle. Parker and Lambert {{are killed by}} the alien while {{gathering}} life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads with the cat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> to find the alien in her path. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. She returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> where the alien is gone, and she narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.|$|E
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> It attempts to crawl {{into one of the}} engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E

25|$|The Space Shuttle Discovery {{also hit}} a bird (a vulture) during {{the launch of}} STS-114 on July 26, 2005, {{although}} the collision occurred soon after lift-off and at low speed, with no obvious damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b>|$|E
25|$|DARPS, Differential, Absolute and Relative Positioning System. Commonly used on shuttle tankers while loading from a FPSO. Both {{will have}} a GPS receiver. As the errors are {{the same for the}} both of them, the signal {{does not need to be}} corrected. The {{position}} from the FPSO is transmitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> tanker, so a range and bearing can be calculated and fed into the DP system.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of other}} Atlantis and Space Station crew members were mostly on {{supporting}} the spacewalk and completing cargo transfers between {{the shuttle and}} the ISS. Station Commander De Winne and STS-129 Mission Specialist Melvin shut down and packed the failed Urine Processor Assembly/Distillation Assembly (UPA DA) and then transferred it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> for stowage on the Middeck. De Winne working with STS-129 Commander Hobaugh afterwards, terminated the transfer of Nitrogen gas from Atlantis to the ISS.|$|E
50|$|After midday, Reisman and Sellers used Canadarm2 <b>to</b> unberth <b>the</b> OBSS {{from the}} sill of Atlantis cargo bay {{and handed it}} off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> robotic arm, {{operated}} by Ham and Antonelli.|$|R
50|$|The next year, NASA {{hired him}} <b>to</b> develop <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Student Involvement Program to spur student {{interest}} through suggestions on possible experiments <b>to</b> conduct aboard <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> Before retiring in 1982, he received NASA's Exceptional Service Medal.|$|R

25|$|He entered {{space for}} the first time on July 4, 2006 as a mission {{specialist}} of mission STS-121 to the International Space Station where he participated in three spacewalks. On July 8, Fossum with Piers Sellers conducted a 7 and a half hour spacewalk making a repair to the ISS and testing using the Shuttle's arm as a platform for making repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle.</b> Fossum became the first Texas A undergraduate to travel to space.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 10 saw {{the joint}} crews {{transfer}} {{samples from the}} space station <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> freezer known as Glacier. The samples {{will be returned to}} earth for examination by scientists who will develop ways to prevent bone and muscle loss in space as well as cures for other illnesses on earth. The crews also completed some close outs of the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Leonardo. The last portion of the crew day was spent off duty.|$|E
25|$|In late May 2016, the MTA {{announced}} that it would extend the Rockaway Park Shuttle from Broad Channel to Rockaway Boulevard during weekends from mid-June until Labor Day 2016. This extension allowed passengers on both Lefferts Boulevard and Far Rockaway-bound trains to transfer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> and for shuttle passengers to transfer to more frequent A train service at Rockaway Boulevard. The trains were also lengthened to eight cars instead of the usual four. This extension was implemented again in summer 2017.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{curvature}} on the platforms, gap fillers {{are used to}} bridge the gap between train and platform; however, the gap fillers, which are under the platform rather than flush with the platform, are not suitable for wheelchair passengers, making the shuttle platforms virtually inaccessible to wheelchair users. Such passengers who need service to Grand Central must use the IRT Flushing Line platforms. An underpass that formerly connected the original side platforms lies between the downtown local track and the other three tracks of the BMT Broadway Line, which runs perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Discovery {{was moved}} from its hangar in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF)-3 {{to the nearby}} 52-story Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) on 9 September 2010. The shuttle emerged from OPF-3 at 06:54 EDT and the {{rollover}} was done at 10:46 EDT when Discovery came to a rest in the VAB's transfer aisle. The quarter-mile trip between the OPF-3 and VAB was the 41st rollover for Discovery. The rollover was originally planned at 06:30 EDT on 8 September 2010. The move did not commence due to the unavailability of fire suppression systems because of a broken water main near the VAB and turn basin that runs out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> launch pads.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, 2008 General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made {{a public}} {{announcement}} that the U.S. intended {{to shoot down}} USA-193. In this announcement he laid out several criteria into when, {{how and why the}} satellite would be shot down. The major objective was to reduce the risk to space, air and terrestrial platforms. He explained that they would wait for the shuttle to land, so the potential harm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> would not be a factor. Next they wanted to wait until the satellite was close to re-entry, this would limit the amount of space debris created. Finally, {{they did not want to}} let the satellite enter the earthâ€™s atmosphere because of its non-aerodynamic characteristics, which would make it extremely hard to intercept. He suggested that these criteria gave them an eight-day window.|$|E
50|$|During the {{development}} of <b>the</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> orbiter in <b>the</b> 1970s, NASA used two modified Boeing 747 airliners, known as <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Carrier Aircraft, <b>to</b> launch <b>the</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> Enterprise, a manned atmospheric test vehicle used <b>to</b> test <b>the</b> orbiter's approach and landing capabilities. These aircraft were subsequently used throughout <b>the</b> Space <b>Shuttle</b> Program <b>to</b> transport <b>the</b> <b>shuttles</b> across long distances.|$|R

50|$|A camera mounted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttles</b> {{external}} tank captured Atlantis {{ascent to}} orbit. This {{was the first}} time such footage was recorded. However, after solid rocket booster separation, the camera was fogged with the propellant, and was rendered unusable. The camera was moved downward after STS-112.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the Orage {{attacks the}} train, causing the brakes to malfunction. The trio detach the car {{containing}} the rocket fuel and {{jump from the}} train, which crashes into the station underneath the Mikado Building. They work {{their way up the}} building and find Dominique in a dome structure. Nearby, Kaldea is playing the piano. After a moment, she gets up and morphs into a panther. Meanwhile, Dauragon orders Wong to transport Dominique <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> Galeos. Wong protests, telling Dauragon he is using the Mikado Group for evil, something of which his father would not approve. Dauragon attacks Wong as the trio enter, and the dying Wong tells them Dauragon must be stopped. Dauragon then reveals that Dominique is his sister. He and the panther attack the trio, defeating them, and the floor falls out underneath them.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 11, {{the joint}} Expedition 22/STS-130 crew {{received}} a phone call from U.S. President Barack Obama and several school children.After the conference with President Obama and the children, the crew members began transferring Environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) racks to the Tranquility module. These transfers were done by ISS commander Jeff Williams, flight engineer T.J. Creamer, shuttle commander George Zamka and mission specialist Stephen Robinson and took most of the day. Also during the day pilot Terry Virts continued working on getting the Cupola set-up for the robotics work station. He had a small problem installing some corner panels which are needed to hold the workstation. Spacewalkers Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick were busy reconfiguring the airlock for use by the station crew and later flights. They also transferred their spacesuits and tools back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> for the return trip home. After the rack transfers were done the crew completed some more transfers and passed the 75% complete mark. The space shuttle commanded by commander George Zamka and pilot Terry Virts completed a reboost of the station using its vernier thrusters.|$|E
25|$|The orbiter docked to the ISS on Flight Day 3, {{marking the}} 13th time Discovery {{had visited the}} ISS. The docking {{occurred}} on time at 19:14 UTC. A hard mate between the two vehicles was delayed by about 40 minutes because of relative motion between the station and shuttle, thus putting the crew behind the timeline for the day. The hatches were finally opened at 21:16 UTC, and the Expedition 26 crew greeted the crew of STS-133. After the welcome ceremony and safety briefing, the crew's main task {{of the day was}} to transfer the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 4 (ELC-4). ELC-4 was taken out of Discovery's payload bay by the Space Station Remote Manipulator (SSRMS), also known as Canadarm2, which was operated by Nicole Stott and Michael Barratt. The SSRMS handed it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), which was being controlled by Boe and Drew, while the SSRMS moved to the Mobile Base System (MBS). Once there, the SSRMS took ELC-4 back from the SRMS, and installed it at its location on the S3 truss location. ELC-4 was installed in its final location at 03:22 UTC on 27 February. While the robotic transfer was going on, Bowen and Lindsey were transferring items that were needed for Flight Day 4 and the spacewalk on Flight Day 5.|$|E
50|$|The Marions {{transmission}} is detected by the Narcissus, <b>the</b> escape <b>shuttle</b> used by Ellen Ripley <b>to</b> flee <b>the</b> {{destruction of the}} Nostromo thirty-five years previously. Unknown <b>to</b> Ripley, <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> is under <b>the</b> control of Ash, who, before his destruction on the Nostromo, uploaded his AI consciousness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttles</b> systems. Learning of the Aliens on the Marion, Ash reroutes <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>to</b> rendezvous with <b>the</b> mining vessel, still seeking to fulfil Special Order 937 and recover one of the creatures. Upon arrival, Ripleys joy at being rescued is quickly shattered by the realization {{that she has been}} drifting {{for three and a half}} decades, that Ash is still with her, and that she has awoken in the midst of another life-threatening scenario involving the Alien horror.|$|R
50|$|Also {{according}} <b>to</b> Aviation Week, <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> initially {{entered a}} 204 km x 519 km orbit, at an inclination of 28.45 degrees <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equator. It then executed three Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burns, the last being executed {{on the fourth}} orbit. The first burn was conducted <b>to</b> circularize <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> orbit at 519 km.|$|R
50|$|After {{the final}} {{hold in the}} {{countdown}} at T-minus 9 minutes, <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> went through its final preparations for launch, and the countdown was automatically controlled by the Ground Launch Sequencer (GLS), software at the Launch Control Center, which stopped the count if it sensed a critical problem with any of <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> onboard systems. <b>The</b> GLS handed off <b>the</b> count <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> on-board computers at T minus 31 seconds, in a process called auto sequence start.|$|R
500|$|The new, unused trackways of {{the planned}} station were covered with {{flooring}} {{and turned into a}} passageway between the Shuttle and Lexington Avenue stations. The shuttle reopened on September 28, 1918, with improved passageways and platforms. Track 2 at the Grand Central station was covered over by a wooden platform. On the walls of the stations, black bands (at Times Square) and green bands (at Grand Central) were painted to guide passengers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> platforms. The shuttle was meant to be [...] "temporary," [...] and by 1922, there were proposals for the shuttle {{to be replaced by a}} moving sidewalk.|$|E
500|$|The {{music at}} the start of the episode of the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon parodies the theme from the {{original}} [...] series. Itchy bursts out of Scratchy's stomach in a parody of the creature from the Alien films. Homer hopes that his crew will not be sent to [...] "that terrible Planet of the Apes", only to suddenly figure out the film's ending; he then unwittingly performs Charlton Heston's final scene in the film. Much of the episode parodies The Right Stuff, with sequences such as Barney and Homer's training, Homer's walk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> and the shuttle's re-entry paying homage to the film. Barney sings the first part of the Major-General's Song from Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance while doing flips to show how fit he is, while Homer responds with cartwheels, reciting [...] "There once was a man from Nantucket...".|$|E
