5000|$|The Greek fable {{tells of}} an ass that is {{carrying}} a religious image and takes the homage of the crowd as being paid to him personally. When pride makes it refuse to go further, the driver beats it and declares {{that the world has}} not yet become so backward that men bow down <b>to</b> <b>asses.</b> The Latin title of the fable, Asinus portans mysteria (or its Greek equivalent, ονος αγων μυστήρια), was used proverbially of such human conceit and was recorded as such in the Adagia of Erasmus.|$|E
50|$|Treatment also {{involves}} {{central nervous system}} penetrating chemotherapy. Options include intrathecal, intraventricular, and systemic chemotherapy. These must penetrate the blood-brain barrier {{in order to be}} effective. Sometimes mixing multiple forms of treatment with chemotherapy seems to be the best route. For example, some significant improvement has been shown as a result of cranial radiation treatment preceding a brief course of intrathecal chemotherapy.6 Although this is an effective treatment to do, penetrating the blood-brain barrier can cause side effects due to the toxicity in the nervous system. These would include dizziness, confusion, and changes in mental status. Another form could be the use of pharmaceuticals, which have all shown positive results for treatment but should always be consulted with a physician <b>to</b> <b>asses</b> risks.|$|E

40|$|Runoff from acid sulfate soils (ASS) has severe {{environmental}} and economic impacts on estuarine ecosystems. Oysters display reduced abundance, growth rate and shell thickness when exposed <b>to</b> <b>ASS</b> runoff, yet the molecular underpinnings of their responses have not been explored. We hypothesised that the proteomes of wild Sydney rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata, would differ between populations recurrently exposed <b>to</b> <b>ASS</b> compared with those unaffected by runoff from ASS. We used two-dimensional electrophoresis to compare protein abundances in the gills of S. glomerata collected from two sites close to (acidified) and two sites away from (reference) major ASS outflow drains in a south-east Australian estuary. Approximately 5 % of the proteome was differentially expressed between oysters from acidified and reference sites, with five protein spots more abundant and one less abundant at the sites close to drains. Another protein spot was present only in oysters from reference sites. This study is the first screening of spatial variation in the protein expression of S. glomerata with respect <b>to</b> discharge from <b>ASS.</b> Altered protein expression may underpin short-term inducible responses <b>to</b> <b>ASS</b> runoff, or genetic resistance acquired through recurrent exposure of populations to the stressor. 9 page(s...|$|R
