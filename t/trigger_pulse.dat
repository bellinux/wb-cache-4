In this paper it is shown how a spatially-selective and internal-state-selective <b>triggering</b> <b>pulse</b> is constructed generally in the quantum system of a single atom. Rigorous theoretical calculation and error estimation, which are based on the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition method and the multiple-Gaussian-wave-packet expansion method, are carried out for the time evolution process of a single atom in the double-well potential field and {{in the presence of the}} spatially-selective and internal-state-selective <b>triggering</b> <b>pulse.</b> It proves that the spatially-selective and internal-state-selective <b>triggering</b> <b>pulse</b> is feasible, that is, the possible errors generated by the <b>triggering</b> <b>pulse</b> are shown to be controllable. This rigorous theoretical calculation also shows that the spatially-selective and internal-state-selective <b>triggering</b> <b>pulse</b> may be different from its corresponding ideal internal-state-selective <b>triggering</b> <b>pulse</b> that is not spatially selective, but the difference between their final states of the time evolution process is controllable. These computational results are achieved with the help of the Gaussian wave-packet motional states and the space-dependent quadratic Hamiltonians of a single atom.

50|$|Krytrons {{can switch}} {{currents}} {{of up to}} about 3000 amperes and voltages up to about 5000 volts. Commutation time of less than 1 nanosecond can be achieved, with a delay between {{the application of the}} <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> and switching as low as about 30 nanoseconds.

In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the disadvantages which existed in traditional control system of electro-excavator, such as backward technology, large noise, inconvenient operation, low dynamic efficiency, high cost and so on, the structure and the working principle of DC speed control system were firstly analyzed.

50|$|The <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> {{has to be}} {{much more}} intense, as there is no preionized gas path for the {{electric}} current, and a vacuum arc must form between the cathode and anode.

50|$|This design, {{dating from}} the late 1940s, is still capable of pulse-power {{performance}} {{that even the most}} advanced semiconductors (even IGBTs) cannot match easily.

The use of microcontroller based control circuit provides us large number of advantages. It reduces size and cost of controller significantly. The efficient control of delay angle is the main advantage. Besides this it provide more versality and greater scope for further improvement just by changing the program but not hardware configuration. Its long life and no fatigue are the most appreciated characteristics. The generated <b>triggering</b> <b>pulse</b> is synchronised with supply frequency and recorded for various delay angle.

50|$|A {{cascade of}} spark gaps allows {{to use a}} weak <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> to {{initiate}} a streamer in the smaller gap, wait for its transition into an arc, and then for this arc to extend into the larger gap. Still the first spark gap in the cascade needs a free electron to start with, so jitter is rather high.|$|E
5000|$|External {{triggering}} is {{the most}} common method of operation, especially for photographic use. The electrodes are charged to a voltage high enough to respond to triggering, but below the lamp's self-flash threshold. An extremely high voltage pulse, (usually between 2000 and 150,000 volts), the [...] "trigger pulse", is applied either directly to or very near the glass envelope. (Water-cooled flashtubes sometimes apply this pulse directly to the cooling water, and often to the housing of the unit as well, so care must be taken with this type of system.) The short, high voltage pulse creates a rising electrostatic field, which ionizes the gas inside the tube. The capacitance of the glass couples the <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> into the envelope, where it exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas surrounding {{one or both of the}} electrodes, forming spark streamers. The streamers propagate via capacitance along the glass at a speed of 1 centimeter in 60 nanoseconds (170 km/s). (A <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> must have a long enough duration to allow one streamer to reach the opposite electrode, or erratic triggering will result.) The triggering can be enhanced by applying the <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> to a [...] "reference plane", which may be in the form of a metal band or reflector affixed to the glass, a conductive paint, or a thin wire wrapped around the length of the lamp. If the capacitor voltage is greater than the voltage drop between the cathode and the anode, when the internal spark streamers bridge the electrodes the capacitor will discharge through the ionized gas, heating the xenon to a high enough temperature for the emission light.|$|E

50|$|The laser voltage probe (LVP) is a {{laser-based}} voltage {{and timing}} waveform acquisition system {{which is used}} to perform failure analysis on flip-chip integrated circuits. The device to be analyzed is de-encapsulated in order to expose the silicon surface. The silicon substrate is thinned mechanically using a back side mechanical thinning tool. The thinned device is then mounted on a movable stage and connected to an electrical stimulus source. Signal measurements are performed through {{the back side of the}} device after substrate thinning has been performed. The device being probed must be electrically stimulated using a repeating test pattern, with a <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> provided to the LVP as reference. The operation of the LVP is similar to that of a sampling oscilloscope.|$|E
50|$|Series {{triggering}} is {{more common}} in high powered, water-cooled flashtubes, such as those found in lasers. The high-voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series, (one lead to an electrode and the other to the capacitor). The <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> forms a spark inside the lamp, without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp. The advantages are better insulation, more reliable triggering, and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass, but at a much higher cost. The series-triggering transformer also acts as an inductor. This helps to control the flash duration, but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications. The triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at the capacitor than is required for external triggering. However, the trigger-transformer becomes part of the flash circuit, and couples the triggering-circuit to the flash energy. Therefore, because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance, the transformer, triggering-circuit, and silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) must be able to handle very high peak-currents, often in excess of 1500 amps.|$|E
50|$|Sprytrons {{are often}} {{designed}} similar to trigatrons, with the trigger electrode coaxial to the cathode. In one design the trigger electrode is formed as metallization {{on the inner}} surface of an alumina tube. The <b>trigger</b> <b>pulse</b> causes surface flashover, which liberates electrons and vaporized surface discharge material into the inter-electrode gap, which facilitates formation of a vacuum arc, closing the switch. The short switching time suggests electrons from the trigger discharge and the corresponding secondary electrons knocked from the anode as the initiation of the switching operation; the vaporized material travels too slowly through the gap to play significant role. The repeatability of the triggering can be improved by special coating of the surface between the trigger electrode and the cathode, and the jitter can be improved by doping the trigger substrate and modifying the trigger probe structures. Sprytrons can degrade in storage, by outgassing from their components, diffusion of gases (especially hydrogen) through the metal components, and gas leaks through the hermetic seals; an example tube manufactured with internal pressure of 0.001 Pa will exhibit spontaneous gap breakdowns when the pressure inside rises to 1 Pa. Accelerated testing of storage life {{can be done by}} storing in increased ambient pressure, optionally with added helium, for leak testing, and increased temperature storage (150 &deg;C) for outgassing testing. Sprytrons can be made miniaturized and rugged.|$|E
