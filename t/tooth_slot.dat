First, a magnetic circuit network for the proposed machine is built, and formulas for the calculation of the magnetic components in the circuit, including the permeances of <b>teeth,</b> yokes, <b>slots,</b> leakage permeances, and air-gap permeances, are derived. Then, by applying Kirchhoff's current law to each node in the network, nodal analysis is used to solve the matrix equation. All the circuit variables, and hence the complete motor magnetic characteristics are being considered. When the rotor rotates, the air-gap permeances are adjusted accordingly, and the above calculations are repeated, so as to find the complete static performance of the motor.

40|$|Methods for {{accurate}} grinding of face-hobbed bevel gears {{have not been}} developed to date, the main obstacles being their epicycloidal lengthwise <b>tooth</b> curve and <b>slot</b> width taper. Grinding them while preserving their geometry would be desirable, as the epicycloidal tooth curve makes face-hobbed gears less sensitive to misalignments and deflections. To this end, we propose a method based on a flared-cup grinding wheel, whereby generated members are ground by a two-parameter enveloping process, while non-generated ones are finished by a one-parameter enveloping motion. Machine motions are synthesized exploiting the capabilities of 6 -axis hypoid generators. Interference between parts is avoided...|$|R

The method is based on doubling the number of stator slots, using two identical winding systems connected in series and shifted to each other for a specific angle, using stator core with different tooth width and using different turns per coil for the neighbouring phase coils. With the proposed technique the unwanted sub- and high winding MMF harmonics can be reduced or completely canceled...|$|R

The eddy current brake is a brake that generates a braking torque in a rotational direction opposite to the direction of the rotor by using a time-varying magnetic flux. The eddy current brake has the advantage of being able to take high current densities because this is used {{for a short period of}} time. Also, the eddy current brake is influenced by multiple factor such as number of <b>slots,</b> <b>teeth</b> width, coating thickness, air-gap length and so on.

40|$|The cutting {{forces and}} dynamic {{stability}} of end milling of full radial immersion are compared for end-millers {{of one to}} ten teeth. The parameters; tool mass tool natural frequency, tool damping ratio and feed speed are considered fixed for the millers. An end-milling tooth normally has positive rake angle and small cutting edge radius thus workpiece material cutting coefficient is also considered fixed since ploughing effect {{is not expected to}} be noticeably affected by change in number of teeth. It is seen that periodic cutting force reduces as the number of teeth increases. A method of milling stability analysis as proposed by Ding et al known as full-discretization is utilized in generating the stability charts. Use is made of the Simpson’s rule in establishing for the studied system that chatter stability decreases as the number of teeth increases in the low spindle speed range and that lowest chatter stability at high spindle speed range occurs for the five tooth miller. Recommendations are made for the machinist based on these findings. The critical characteristic multipliers at single minimum point of each secondary Hopf bifurcation lobe (SHBL) are postulated to leave the unit circle along imaginary axis when number of <b>teeth</b> of <b>slotting</b> miller is greater than two. This phenomenon is noticed for the one and two tooth millers at two turning points that are not necessarily local minima of each SHBL...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} magnetic simulation {{and analysis}} of radial flux permanent magnet generator (PMG) using finite element method (FEM) by utilizing open source software FEMM 4. 2. The specification of generator is 25 V, 28 A, 3 phase, 300 rpm. The analyzed magnetic flux {{was in the air}} gap, stator <b>teeth</b> and <b>slots</b> to find out the distribusian pattern and its fluctuation. The simulations were conducted in no-load and nominal load (28 A) conditions. Furthermore the maximum flux density of simulation (B g(sim)) was used to calculate phase voltage E ph to find out the magnitude of generated electromotive force (EMF). The calculation results were presented as voltage vs. rotation graph in no-load condition and voltage vs. current graph in nominal load condition. Both graphs were validated with E ph of experiment result (E ph(exp)) and E ph that the value of B g obtained from analytical calculation (E ph(calc)). The final results showed that in no-load condition, E ph graph with B g(sim) (E ph(sim)) was close to E ph(exp) and E ph(calc). The error rate with respect to the experiment was 6, 9 %. In nominal load condition, E ph(sim) graph almost coincides with E ph(calc.) graph, with the voltage drop of both was 0, 441 V. Both graphs however were far different from E ph(exp) graph, which has 9 V of voltage drop. The overall results demonstrated that magnetic distribution pattern presented by FEM was very helpful to avoid magnetic flux accumulation in a particular segment.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} bulk-fill resin based composite materials on cuspal deflection in large slot mesio-occlusal-distal cavities (MOD) in premolar teeth. Methodology: Thirty-two sound maxillary premolar <b>teeth</b> with large <b>slot</b> MOD cavities were distributed to four groups (n= 8). Three groups were restored with bulk-fill resin composite materials (Tetric EvoCeram, x-tra fil, and Sonic Fill, respectively) in a single increment. The conventional composite group, Filtek Z 100, was used to restore the cavities in 2 mm increments. Cusp deflection was recorded post irradiation using a Nikon measurescope UM- 2 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), by measuring {{the changes in the}} bucco-palatal width of the premolar teeth at 5 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours after completion of the restoration. The cuspal deflection was obtained by recording the difference between the baseline measurements and the other measurements for each tooth. Results: Cuspal deflection was significantly higher in Conventional Composite than in Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill (p= 0. 0031), x-tra Fil Bulk (p= 0. 0029), and SonicFill Bulk (p= 0. 0002). There {{was no significant difference in}} cuspal deflection for Tetric EvoCeram Bulk, X-tra Fil Bulk, and SonicFill Bulk Composites. Conclusions: All the investigated bulk-fill resin composites exhibited cuspal deflection lower than conventional resin composite. One of the aims of research and studies on the resin composite materials is improving their clinical longevity, and simplifying their use. For that purpose bulk-fill materials are considered promising materials and further clinical studies should be conducted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analytical subdomain model together with its field solutions for predicting {{the magnetic field}} distributions in surface-mounted permanent magnet (PM) machines. The <b>tooth</b> tips and <b>slotting</b> effects during open-circuit, armature reaction, and on-load conditions are considered when deriving the model and developing its solutions. The model derivations and field solutions are extended from a previous model, and {{can be applied to}} PM machines with any combinations of slot and pole numbers and any magnetization patterns in the magnets. This model is initially formulated according to Laplace 2 ̆ 7 s and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s equations in 2 -D polar coordinates by the separation of variables technique in four subdomains, such as magnet, airgap, winding slots, and slot-openings. The field solution of each subdomain is obtained applying the appropriate boundary conditions and interface conditions between every two subdomains, respectively, which can precisely account for the mutual influence between slots. Finite element analysis (FEA) is later deployed to validate the analytical results in a surface-mounted PM machine that has nonoverlapping winding arrangement. For validation purposes, PM machines having 3 -slot/ 2 -pole with parallel magnetization and 12 -slot/ 10 -pole with either parallel or radial magnetizations are used for comparisons. Computation of global quantities for the motor which include the phase back-EMF and cogging torque is also included. The results indicate that the proposed analytical model can accurately predict the magnetic field distributions in each subdomain and the motor 2 ̆ 7 s global quantities, which are in good agreement with those obtained from the FEA...|$|R
40|$|We have {{modified}} {{several aspects}} of the single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) method {{to increase the speed}} with which the technique can be used for mutation detection. The methods attain high resolution of small mobility differences using long (30 cm) gels and use a modified polymerase reaction to maximise detection sensitivity using a minimised quantity of 32 P. By using custom cut "sharktooth" combs (4. 5 mm between <b>teeth)</b> as the <b>slot</b> formers, commercially available multichannel pipettes (9 mm tip to tip) can be used to load eight or 12 samples at a time from standard microtitre plates. PCR products that have been prepared and radiolabelled using simplified protocols are loaded on to the gel, and after a precalculated time of electrophoresis another set of samples can be loaded, either with combs moved across 2. 25 mm or onto the same gel tracks. The run conditions are calculated so that there is no overlap between the bands produced by the two loadings, thus doubling the amount of information that can be gained from one gel. A computer program has been developed to solve equations to determine suitable timings for repetitive loadings. Finally, a modification of the gel pouring system is described so that two gels can be poured between three standard glass plates, with both gels run simultaneously. Of the order of 1000 PCR reactions can be prepared and analysed in 24 man hours using five 40 cm x 30 cm gel tanks. The application of these techniques is described to detect SSCPs in exon 3 of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene in 791 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Eight different SSCP patterns were seen, one of which was caused by the previously described E 80 K mutation, which was present in 11 patients (1. 4 %).

40|$|Acoustic {{noise and}} {{associated}} vibration are potentially troubling characteristics of electric machines including variable-reluctance motors, induction machines, and permanent magnet synchronous motors. The severity {{of this problem}} depends on the types of motors and their applications. One exemplary case where the vibro-acoustic noise becomes especially detrimental is iron-core linear motors operating at high acceleration and targeted for high accuracy applications. In this doctoral research, we identify root causes of the vibro-acoustic noise of iron-core linear motors, and create magnetic designs paired with control algorithms to achieve high-acceleration with low noise and vibration. Vibro-acoustic noise issues of rotary machines have been researched over the years, {{but not as much}} work has been done for linear machines whose major causes of noise generation might be different from rotary motors due to the structural differences. This thesis focuses on the following aspects: 1) Investigate the causes and develop and verify theory for acoustic noise emitted from linear iron-core machines. 2) Design, construct, and test a new linear iron-core motor that can simultaneously provide high force and low noise. 3) Design and construct an experimental linear motor testbed to investigate the noise issue of conventional iron-core motors, and to demonstrate the new motor's desired performance of high force and low noise. We hypothesize and experimentally validate that the acoustic noise and associated vibration of linear iron-core permanent magnet motors are caused by high frequency force harmonics vibrating the moving stage. Such stage vibration can be transmitted through the system structure and can also radiate as acoustic noise, thereby disturbing precision machines. In order to reduce high frequency force harmonic content, our new motor has fine <b>teeth,</b> narrow <b>slots</b> with high slot aspect ratio, five phases, and a moving Halbach magnet array. With our new fine-tooth motor, we significantly reduce the vibro-acoustic noise of linear iron-core motors while substantially enhancing the shear stress density, compared to conventional 3 - 4 combination iron-core motors. The overall acoustic noise level in Pascals is reduced by 93 % during the acceleration period with non-skewed magnets. In terms of the sound pressure level (SPL), this is a significant noise reduction from 83 dB to 60 dB. The cogging-driven and velocity dependent noise, which is dominant in constant velocity regions, is also significantly reduced in our new motor design. Our fine-tooth motor design reduces the cogging force by a factor of 10 -to- 1 when using skewed magnets, thereby reducing cogging driven acoustic noise by 90 % in Pascals. We also present in this thesis the force performance of our new fine-tooth motor both in simulations and experiments. Our new motor shows predicted shear stress improvements of 28 % (from 0. 090 N/mm 2 to 0. 115 N/mm 2) at the prototype practical power level of 10 W/mm and 84 % (from 0. 167 N/mm 2 to 0. 308 N/mm 2) at an anticipated ultimate RMS (root mean square) current density limit in the coil wires of 50 A/mm 2, relative to a conventional motor. Understanding causes of the vibro-acoustic noise and how to mitigate it in both the design and post-design phases provides useful tools to achieve high-performance and quiet linear motion devices. This research will benefit many industrial applications which require both high throughput and high accuracy. by Jun Young Yoon. Thesis: Ph.
