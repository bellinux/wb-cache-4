5|$|There were originally, in effect, {{only two}} ranks to the Order of Canada: Companion and <b>the</b> <b>Medal</b> <b>of</b> Service.

This latter decoration fell in rank between {{the other two}} levels, but was anomalous within the Order of Canada, being a separate award of a different nature rather than a middle grade of the order. Without ever having been awarded, <b>the</b> <b>Medal</b> <b>of</b> Courage was on 1 July 1972 replaced by the autonomous Cross of Valour and, at the same time, the levels of Officer and Member were introduced, with all existing holders of <b>the</b> <b>Medal</b> <b>of</b> Service created as Officers.
