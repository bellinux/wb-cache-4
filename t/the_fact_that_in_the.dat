5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking {{as a matter of}} good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E
5|$|Gulf Oil {{was most}} synonymous for its {{association}} with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early '70s. The signature light blue and orange color scheme associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 {{is one of the}} most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its popularity is attributed to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1971 film Le Mans, Steve McQueen's character, Michael Delaney, drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen's increasing popularity following his death and the increasing popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark color scheme. In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange color scheme with Gulf blue for lettering.|$|E

5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes {{like the}} one in which Sasuke admits his crimes and agrees to go to prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, as well as his decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was a fitting conclusion for the character after the series' events, and fit well with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's fate in the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E
25|$|To skeptics, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} life on the Earth only one species has {{developed}} a civilization {{to the point of being}} capable of spaceflight and radio technology, lends more credence to the idea that technologically advanced civilizations are rare in the universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} {{determination of the}} center of mass of a body uses gravity forces on the body and relies on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parallel gravity field near {{the surface of the earth}} the center of mass is the same as the center of gravity.|$|E

25|$|Hai's {{conservative}} standpoint explains <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{study of}} esoteric sciences he detected {{a danger to}} the religious life and a deterrent {{to the study of the}} Law. He warned against the study of philosophy, even when pursued with the plea that it leads to a better knowledge of G-d.|$|E
25|$|His {{opinions}} influenced {{many other}} jurists, {{thanks to the}} clarity and finesse of his reasoning, as is demonstrated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Digest, there are 457 fragments written by Iulianus. His name also appears first {{in the list of}} contributing jurisprudents prepared by order of Justinian, the Index Florentinus. Centuries after his death, Emperor Justinianus would define him legum et edicti perpetui suptilissimus conditor.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a t-norm (also T-norm or, unabbreviated, {{triangular}} norm) {{is a kind}} of {{binary operation}} used in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces and in multi-valued logic, specifically in fuzzy logic. A t-norm generalizes intersection in a lattice and conjunction in logic. The name triangular norm refers to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework of probabilistic metric spaces t-norms are used to generalize triangle inequality of ordinary metric spaces.|$|E

25|$|In second {{match of}} the series Australia lost the match and series was levelled.

He still contributed with 32 and his opening replacement Aaron Finch top-scored with 36, but Shaun Marsh at first drop failed to score and the batting was weakened with the allrounders Daniel Christian and James Faulkner left out.|$|E
25|$|In {{this article}} {{constant}} pressure blackout and shallow water blackout refers to blackouts {{in shallow water}} following hyperventilation and ascent blackout and deep water blackout refers to blackout on ascent from depth. Some free divers consider blackout on ascent to be a special condition or subset of shallow water blackout but the primary underlying mechanisms differ. This confusion is exacerbated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of blackout on ascent, hyperventilation induced hypocapnia also may be a contributory factor even if depressurisation on ascent is the actual precipitator.|$|E
25|$|The Kofun {{period of}} Japanese culture is also {{sometimes}} called the Yamato period by some Western scholars, since this local chieftainship rose to become the Imperial dynasty {{at the end of}} the Kofun period. Yamato and its dynasty however were just one rival polity among others throughout the Kofun era. Japanese archaeologists emphasise instead <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half of the Kofun period, other regional chieftainships, such as Kibi were in close contention for dominance or importance. The Tsukuriyama Kofun of Kibi is the fourth largest kofun in Japan.|$|E
50|$|During the 19th century, Nietzsche was {{frequently}} associated with anarchist movements, <b>in</b> spite of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> his writings he definitely holds a negative view of egalitarian anarchists.|$|R
30|$|Note {{that the}} process to build the in-bound {{subgraph}} is equivalent to it except for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this case <b>the</b> edges to be chosen are always incoming edges.|$|R
50|$|A 2013 ad {{campaign}} for SKODA, starring Xzibit, parodies <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> some episodes they would simply replace to car completely with another, {{in this case}} a SKODA Yeti.|$|R
25|$|The {{need for}} the Japanese rules to address the {{definition}} {{of life and death}} follows from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese rules, scores are calculated by territory rather than by area. The rules cannot simply require a player to play on in order to prove that an opponent's group is dead, since playing in their own territory to do this would reduce their score. Therefore, the game is divided into a phase of ordinary play, and a phase of determination of life and death (which according to the Japanese rules is not technically part of the game).|$|E
25|$|Others contest these conclusions, {{stating that}} family courts are biased {{in favor of}} fathers and that the lower {{percentage}} of separated fathers as custodial parents {{is a result of}} choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts. According to sociologist Michael Flood, father's rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between mothers and fathers, and ignored <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because they are willing to do so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, most {{historians and}} economists are {{conditioned}} {{to believe that}} steadily and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economic growth during this era. For they have overlooked <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> natural course of events, when government and the banking system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, freemarket capitalism will result in an increase of production and economic growth so great as to swamp the increase of money supply. Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, {{and the spread of}} the increased living standard to all the consumers.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{intellectual}} jousting with Lilith that sits alongside the narrative of post-divorce navigation hinges on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> psychological terms Lilith is a behaviorist whereas Frasier is a psychoanalyst.|$|R
30|$|Part (a) of the lemma {{follows from}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> any reduced {{computation}} of Sym(M) inverses of commands of M cannot {{be followed by}} commands of M (since M is deterministic).|$|R
30|$|This result is, in part, {{driven by}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Northern Italy, both mixed {{nationality}} marriages and second marriages of divorced {{people are more}} diffused than in Southern Italy (see ISTAT 2011).|$|R
25|$|Through productivity-enhancing {{investments}} in fixed capital, {{the use of}} a large amount of energy (heat energy from peat as an industrial fuel, wind power) per worker, and a substantial investment in human capital (as witnessed by the high literacy rate), the Dutch managed to raise labor productivity above the levels prevailing in other European countries. This is illustrated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-17th century the agricultural sector, employing less than 40 percent of the labor force, could already almost be a net food exporter (which it became by 1800), and the fact that nominal wages between 1600 and 1800 were the highest in Europe. In the open economy of the Republic such a wage gap could only be sustained by enduring productivity differences.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005 Mugabe signed {{constitutional}} amendments that reinstituted a national senate (abolished in 1987) and that nationalised all land. This converted all ownership rights into leases. The amendments also ended {{the right of}} landowners to challenge government expropriation {{of land in the}} courts and marked the end of any hope of returning any land that had been hitherto grabbed by armed land invasions. Elections for the senate in November resulted in a victory for the government. The MDC split over whether to field candidates and partially boycotted the vote. In addition to low turnout there was widespread government intimidation. The split in the MDC hardened into factions, each of which claimed control of the party. The early months of 2006 were marked by food shortages and mass hunger. The sheer extremity of the siltation was revealed by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts, state witnesses said they were too weak from hunger to testify.|$|E
25|$|This play is {{of special}} {{significance}} for Chicago in that Seurat's masterpiece, {{the backdrop of}} the play, hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. The Chicago Shakespeare Theater presented the musical in 2002, directed by Gary Griffin in the more intimate, 200 seat, Upstairs Theater. In September 2012, Griffin returned to direct the play in the larger downstairs Courtyard Theater. Notable in this production is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final scene of the play, all of the cast appear in white costumes; the music for the production is supplied by a live orchestra seated above and {{to the rear of the}} actors where they can be seen by the audience. Griffin also chose to have as background for the performance a full-stage reproduction of Seurat's work which changed in both content and color to match certain moments in the play. The lead roles were played by Jason Danieley as George, Carmen Cusack as Dot, and Linda Stephens as the Old Lady.|$|E
50|$|Although {{settlement}} {{began in}} the 1840s, the name of Kaysville connects with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1851 William Kay was made the bishop in the vicinity by Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball.|$|R
