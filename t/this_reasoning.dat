5|$|Lord Keith {{stated in}} the {{judgement}} {{that there was no}} reason why <b>this</b> <b>reasoning</b> could not apply in English law. He stated that following the Matrimonial Causes Acts, the definition of marriage had moved from Hale's time from where the wife was subservient to her husband into a contract of equals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take <b>this</b> <b>reasoning</b> a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E
5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson (born 13 January 1963) is {{a former}} officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He {{believes}} he was subject to unfair dismissal from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former employer to a tribunal. MI6 refused, arguing that {{to do so would}} breach state security, although Tomlinson disputed <b>this</b> <b>reasoning.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{death toll}} is unknown but {{traditionally}} {{thought to have}} been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded. <b>This</b> <b>reasoning</b> has recently been challenged {{on the grounds that the}} deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded, while the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains. A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached 1250 °C.|$|E
5|$|Although Theodore {{appears to}} have assumed, and was {{addressed}} by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown. The French scholar Lucien Stiernon places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228, but the Greek Apostolos D. Karpozilos rejects <b>this,</b> <b>reasoning</b> that Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta. Eleni Bees-Seferli on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. <b>This</b> <b>reasoning</b> was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E

5000|$|In modern argumentation theories, {{arguments}} {{are regarded as}} defeasible passages from premises to a conclusion.

60|$|Isabella smiled {{upon her}} friend, for <b>this</b> was <b>reasoning</b> after her own secret thoughts; but her greater acquirements {{rendered}} her more discriminating in her zeal, {{than was the}} case with the warm-hearted and ardent Marchioness.|$|R
5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of <b>this</b> <b>reasoning</b> is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had reached}} a stalemate and Murad contemplated his next move. He was advised to pillage the countryside, but the surrounding fields had already been burned by Skanderbeg. The sultan decided to stop chasing bodies of men into the forests to prevent further casualties. Mehmed, Murad's son, proposed leaving Svetigrad to strike at Krujë. Murad sternly rejected <b>this,</b> <b>reasoning</b> that the supplies to take Svetigrad would have been wasted and that Krujë would be more strongly defended than Svetigrad. The sultan thus decided to remain at Svetigrad {{in an attempt to}} starve the garrison into submission. Meanwhile, the garrison under the leadership of Peter Perlati made several successful sorties against the Ottomans, in order to ease the encirclement and strengthen his soldiers' morale.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>this</b> <b>reasoning</b> is not sound: juxtaposing the {{two common}} glyphs 200 man and 700 fish is hardly remarkable. The only {{ligature}} is the 200.200.11-2, whereas known authentic texts, even short ones, have numerous ligatures.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Bush Administration {{officials}} advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force {{in response to}} Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under <b>this</b> <b>reasoning,</b> by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraq's compliance through military means.|$|E

25|$|The {{execution}} can be painlessly accomplished, {{without risk}} of consciousness, by the injection {{of a single}} large dose of a barbiturate. By <b>this</b> <b>reasoning,</b> {{the use of any}} other chemicals is entirely superfluous and only serves to unnecessarily increase the risk of pain during the execution. Another possibility would be I.V administration of a powerful and fast-acting opioid, such as sufentanyl, which would ensure comfort while killing via respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer praises Kant for his {{distinction}} between appearance and the things-in-themselves that appear, whereas {{the general consensus}} in German Idealism {{was that this was}} the weakest spot of Kant’s theory, since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances, as Kant argued. The inadmissibility of <b>this</b> <b>reasoning</b> was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.|$|E
25|$|Fackenheim applied <b>this</b> <b>reasoning</b> to {{the state}} of Israel and its Law of Return as a {{necessity}} to prevent a second Holocaust. Had a Jewish state existed in the 1930s, it could have accepted Jewish refugees and rescued large numbers of people. This opinion carries clout with most Jewish people although the specifics of how to apply it in contemporary politics is a subject of debate. Boris Shusteff invokes it in a conservative opposition to Israeli withdrawal from settlements.|$|E

25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by <b>this</b> <b>reasoning</b> we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to <b>this</b> <b>reasoning,</b> it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.|$|E
25|$|Effective altruists {{argue that}} {{counterfactual}} reasoning {{is important to}} determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume {{that the best way}} to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to <b>this</b> <b>reasoning,</b> the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{requirements}} analysis for an agent {{that is to}} be designed is to identify what characteristic capabilities the agent should have. One of the characteristics usually expected for intelligent agents is the capability of <b>reasoning.</b> <b>This</b> paper shows how a {{requirements analysis}} of an agent’s reasoning capability can be made. Reasoning processes may involve dynamically introduced or retracted assumptions: ‘reasoning by assumption’. It is shown for <b>this</b> type of <b>reasoning</b> how relevant dynamic properties at different levels of aggregation can be identified as requirements that characterise the reasoning capability. A software agent has been built that performs <b>this</b> type of <b>reasoning.</b> The dynamic properties have been expressed using the temporal trace language TTL and can and have been checked automatically for sample traces. ...|$|R
