25|$|The Lakers had team {{options to}} {{exercise}} contracts on Josh Powell and D. J. Mbenga. The Lakers {{decided to bring}} both Powell and Mbenga back, paying them $959,000 each. Kobe Bryant also had an option to terminate his contract <b>this</b> <b>offseason,</b> which would pay him approximately $23,000,000 for the season and $24,800,000 for the season after.

25|$|November 3: With the {{beginning}} of free agency season, the Braves were able to remove offseason free agents from the forty-man roster. The free agents for <b>this</b> <b>offseason</b> include shortstop Alex González, infielder Jack Wilson, and veteran relievers Scott Linebrink and George Sherrill. In conjunction with the moves made on November 2, Frank Wren and his staff now have seven roster spots that will be filled with potential offseason acquisitions or prospects they wish to protect from the Rule 5 draft.|$|E

50|$|The Athletics {{would not}} eclipse this season's win total until 1988 (when they won 104). Indeed, {{nearly all of}} the team's stars (Sal Bando, Rollie Fingers, Gene Tenace, Joe Rudi, Bert Campaneris, Don Baylor, Phil Garner, Billy Williams, Claudell Washington, and an injury-plagued Willie McCovey) would depart during the 1976-77 <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> {{staggering}} mass exodus contributed led to a 24-win plunge in 1977.|$|R
25|$|Ron Artest was {{the first}} player from another team to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers <b>this</b> <b>offseason.</b> On July 2, Artest told CBSSports.com that he has agreed to a {{contract}} with the Lakers. He decided not to pursue a more lucrative contract from his former team (the Rockets) and signed a 5-year deal worth $33 million on July 8. The Lakers used their Mid-Level Exception to sign Artest. Artest has long wanted to play for the Lakers and was looking forward to playing with Kobe Bryant and childhood friend Lamar Odom. Artest changed his jersey number from 96 to 37 in honor of Michael Jackson's album Thriller which was the #1 selling album for 37 weeks. Jackson died 13 days earlier.|$|E
2500|$|September 29: On the day {{following}} the historic {{elimination of the}} 2011 Atlanta Braves from playoff contention, Frank Wren announced that manager Fredi González and the entire coaching staff from 2011 would return to their respective roles in 2012. The following day, however, after having a meeting with [...] Larry Parrish, Wren announced that Parrish would {{not return to the}} coaching staff in 2012. He stated that he would spend <b>this</b> <b>offseason</b> seeking a successor to Parrish. With Parrish's departure, the Braves will now have a third hitting coach in three seasons after removing Terry Pendleton from the role after the 2010 season.|$|E
2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, {{but he wants to}} make sure he remains healthy for the rigors of the preseason. He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right now I want to get through <b>this</b> <b>offseason</b> program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see what I can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)." [...] He competed for the starting job in the 2009 NFL Season.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{head coach}} Phil Jackson's {{decision}} to {{not return to}} the Bulls, Michael Jordan announced his second retirement from the NBA during the following <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> was Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls. Scottie Pippen was traded for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. Dennis Rodman was not re-signed either, leading to {{the end of an era}} for the Bulls and the NBA.|$|R
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{growth potential}} for the league is with its Find Your Way Program. The LCBL is constantly working to build brand awareness within the business community of St. Louis. More internship opportunities for the student-athletes {{is the number one}} goal each <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> starts with greater internal hiring; compensating more players to update the website, compile stats, maintain the field, etc. The LCBL plans to stream radio broadcasts of their future games, employing sports journalism majors at local colleges.|$|R
50|$|Jyles {{was again}} traded in the <b>offseason,</b> <b>this</b> {{time to the}} Edmonton Eskimos on December 12, 2011, along with Grant Shaw and a 2012 first round draft pick, for Ricky Ray. On June 24, Jyles was {{declared}} the starting quarterback for 2012. Jyles started the first 8 {{games of the season}} for the Eskimos before he was demoted to 2nd and 3rd string {{for the remainder of the}} season. Ray went on to win the 100th Grey Cup with the Toronto Argonauts and Jyles was released by the Eskimos on January 21, 2013.|$|R

50|$|The league was {{beset by}} {{frequent}} operational interruptions, stemming from systemic financial shortfalls, from summer 2011 onward. The United Football League announced on October 20, 2012, {{that it was}} ceasing operations immediately, after four weeks of play. The official line from the league was that they intended to resume operations and complete the unfinished 2012 schedule at an unspecified time in spring 2013, then revert to a new fall schedule in fall 2013 without a full <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> announcement, however, was met with widespread skepticism from {{both within and outside}} the league, skepticism that was proven to be warranted as the league never returned as promised.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pictures}} {{and information on}} baseball cards sold during one season came primarily from earlier seasons, so Topps used various tactics to give its cards {{a greater sense of}} staying current with the times. Before coming {{up with the idea of}} a [...] "Traded" [...] set, the company still tried to produce cards of players with their new team if they changed teams in the <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> was sometimes accomplished by showing the player without any team cap, or by airbrushing out elements of the former team's logo on his uniform. Cards for rookies could also be prepared by airbrushing over their minor-league uniforms in photos.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the guilty verdict from the CAS on 12 January 2016, all {{affected}} players began their suspensions immediately. The two year ineligibility period was backdated to 31 March 2015, and credit was taken for the periods of provisional suspension already served during the 2014/15 <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> meant that majority of players were suspended until November 2016, and consequently the players missed the entire 2016 season. Alwyn Davey and Leroy Jetta, who had served shorter provisional suspensions due to their participation in the NTFL, were suspended until February 2017; this saw them miss the end of the 2015/16 NTFL season, the whole of the 2016 winter season and most of the 2016/17 NTFL season.|$|R
50|$|During the 2005-2006 offseason, a {{video board}} {{was added to}} the stadium along with a {{full-sized}} souvenir shed on the third base side of the stadium. The San Jose Giants introduced their first mascot, Gigante, during <b>this</b> <b>offseason.</b>|$|E
50|$|On June 20, Ian McCoshen {{signed with}} his drafted team, the Florida Panthers, {{forgoing}} {{his senior season}} and becoming the 6th eagle to depart the program early <b>this</b> <b>offseason.</b> He also chose to relinquished his assumed captainship, leaving Chris Calnan {{to serve as the}} sole captain for the 16-17 season.|$|E
50|$|During <b>this</b> <b>offseason</b> the Ravens waived Jamal Lewis, {{who signed}} with the Cleveland Browns, and failed to re-sign Adalius Thomas who {{signed with the}} New England Patriots, and Ovie Mughelli who signed with the Atlanta Falcons. Ravens then traded for Willis McGahee with a 3rd and 7th round draft pick in 2007 and a 3rd round pick in 2008.|$|E
50|$|In early 2010, he was {{on trial}} with Toronto FC, scoring the first goal of their preseason. On March 26, 2010, Toronto FC signed Gargan to a contract. He made his debut for Toronto in away loss to New England Revolution on April 10. He scored his first career MLS goal in a 1-1 draw with Houston Dynamo on July 1. He quickly earned a spot as a continual starter, playing in all spots across the midfield and back line, {{sporting}} the captain's armband towards {{the close of the}} season. Even with a coaching change that <b>offseason,</b> <b>this</b> role would continue in to the following season when he started in 12 of his 16 appearances, before being traded to Chicago midseason.|$|R
50|$|The 2004 Philadelphia Eagles {{season was}} the 72nd {{season for the}} team in the National Football League (NFL). The Eagles {{had been one of}} the most {{successful}} teams in the league after the Andy Reid and Donovan McNabb era began in 1999, making it to the playoffs for four straight seasons and to the NFC Championship Game in 2001, 2002, and 2003. However, the team could not reach the Super Bowl, despite being favored in the final two NFC title games. In the <b>offseason,</b> <b>this</b> already championship-level team was reinforced on both sides of the ball by the free agent additions of wide receiver Terrell Owens, defensive end Jevon Kearse, and middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, their thirdround draft pick in 1998.|$|R
25|$|Gameiro's {{first goal}} in the 12/13 {{campaign}} came 29 September 2012 against FC Sochaux, coupled with a second 22 minutes later.

Gameiro scored his first goal in 2013 against Toulouse FC, on 23 January, in Coupe de France play. Gameiro scored a notable assist when PSG squared off against Valencia CF in Champions League play, with Gameiro feeding Ezequiel Lavezzi for a 66th-minute goal, bequeathing PSG the aggregate victory. Gameiro's next goal came 29 March against Montpellier; 2013's final Gameiro goals were both scored against Gameiro's former outfit Lorient on 26 May. Given that Gameiro was transferred in the <b>offseason,</b> <b>this</b> occasion marked both his last scoring performance and last match for PSG.|$|R
50|$|The Gold Coast Football Club was to {{join the}} AFL in 2011, and was {{provided}} with several draft concessions, including additional draft selections, early access to recruit 17-year-old players, and access to uncontracted and previously listed players in <b>this</b> <b>offseason.</b> These concessions {{were similar to those}} provided to the Greater Western Sydney Giants in the following season.|$|E

50|$|One of {{his more}} memorable matches for the season was on the June 29 match with the Carps at Koshien, where his parents, who {{came all the way}} from his {{hometown}} to watch, were also in attendance. On the 4th inning, he reached base on a walk, stole second, and scored on a single to center by Matt Murton. Down one run in the 5th, with runners on first and third and one out, he laid down a squeeze bunt hit to tie the game at three. In the 9th inning, with runners on first and second and two out, he hit a walk-off double to left and the Tigers won the game.

5000|$|After being bumped up to {{the front}} row, Jamie McMurray said that he was [...] "really proud of {{everyone}} at the entire shop. When you come to a 1.5-mile track you're really depending on your car. And our 1.5-mile program last year wasn't where it needed to be. They put a lot of effort into it. Like I said during Speedweeks and all the <b>offseason,</b> <b>this</b> is where you really need to be good. The No. 42 car (teammate Kyle Larson) was fast in practice. He got really loose, it looked like, in his qualifying laps. But then, we were really good as well. So I'm proud of the effort by everybody on the McDonald's Chevrolet. We're {{off to a good start}} at the 1.5-mile tracks, which is critical." ...|$|R
50|$|In addition, for {{the second}} {{straight}} offseason, a Vanderbilt assistant accepted a Division I head coaching position. In the 2011 offseason, King Rice left to become the head coach at Monmouth. <b>This</b> <b>offseason,</b> Dan Muller returned to his alma mater of Illinois State. Stallings chose not to hire a new assistant. Previously, he had rotated the administrative role of director of basketball operations among his assistants. This season, he named former Commodores player Dan Cage as director of basketball operations and removed that role from his assistants.|$|E

And we really need some leadership on the floor. I think our guys are still young in their development there; it's a lot to ask an entire group to assume that leadership role. So, that's the wish list, if you could get everything you wanted.

500|$|Bordagaray {{showed up}} at spring {{training}} in 1936 with a mustache, which he grew for a bit role in The Prisoner of Shark Island, filmed during the <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> was scandalous, as baseball players {{were expected to be}} clean shaven at the time; the last player believed to have worn a mustache was Wally Schang during the 1914 season. Looking for stories to write about, sportswriters for the Dodgers encouraged Bordagaray to grow out his mustache and goatee. The Brooklyn Eagle hosted a contest to determine what sort of beard Bordagaray should grow. After a few months, Dodgers manager Casey Stengel made him shave, saying [...] "If anyone's going to be a clown on this club, it's going to be me." [...] Mustaches would not be seen in MLB again until Oakland Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley paid his players to grow facial hair in the 1970s. Finley hosted a [...] "mustache day", and invited Bordagaray to serve as master of ceremonies.|$|R
2500|$|The tight salary-matching {{rules of}} the 2005 CBA often {{required}} what NBA cap analyst Larry Coon called [...] "trade ballast"—extra players added to a deal solely for salary matching, who would typically be waived by their new teams. Under that CBA, such players were restricted from rejoining their original teams for 30days during the season or 20days in the <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> led to what Coon called [...] "wink-wink deals where players are traded with the full expectation of returning later." [...] A notable {{example of such a}} deal occurred in the 2009–10 season, in which the Cleveland Cavaliers included Zydrunas Ilgauskas in their trade with the Washington Wizards for Antawn Jamison. Ilgauskas was waived a week later without ever appearing in a game for the Wizards, and re-signed with Cleveland after the 30-day waiting period passed. Under the 2011 CBA, a player acquired in a trade and waived by his new team cannot re-sign with his original team until one year after the trade or July 1 after the expiration of his contract, whichever is sooner.|$|R
50|$|The stadium was {{scheduled}} to undergo a massive construction and expansion project beginning in the offseason of 2012. However, {{the start of the}} project was delayed until the 2013 <b>offseason.</b> <b>This</b> expansion project increased Paulson Stadium's total capacity to 25,000 and moved all of Georgia Southern's football facilities to a state-of-the-art Football Operations Center onsite. At the time the plan was originally announced, the 57,000-square foot facility was intended to be first of class at the FCS level and rival many at the FBS level; at the time of completion, Georgia Southern was a transitional FBS member in the Sun Belt Conference. The Ted Smith Family Football Center consists of coaches' offices, team meeting rooms, locker rooms, rehabilitation rooms, weight room and the Georgia Southern Football Hall of Fame. The $10 million facility is the largest privately funded project in the history of Georgia Southern University. The northern mid-deck was completed in time for the Spring 2014 commencement ceremony while the Ted Smith Family Football Center was formally dedicated on August 16, 2014.|$|R
