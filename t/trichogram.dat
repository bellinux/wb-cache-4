40|$|BACKGROUND: In some individuals, {{dandruff}} may be recurrent {{and even}} chronic. This represents a difficult-to-treat condition. Excessive hair shedding and diffuse alopecia may develop. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the chronobiological aspects of dandruff, hair shedding and alopecia. METHODS: This study {{was performed in}} eight men suffering from such a scalp condition. They were examined 40 times at regular intervals for five consecutive years. Hair-density assessments and <b>trichograms</b> were performed at least twice per trimester on the parietal region of the scalp, corresponding to an area where dandruff was present. RESULTS: A positive correlation {{was found between the}} percentage of telogen hairs and dandruff severity as assessed by the squamometry index. Bimodal yearly biorhythms were found for dandruff severity, telogen counts and hair loss between two consecutive visits. The chronobiological fluctuations were prominent in some study participants, but remained inconspicuous in others. The biorhythms were almost synchronized in all participants, showing variations over the year. CONCLUSIONS: The biorhythms on the hair cycle in dandruff are not fundamentally different from those previously reported in subjects without dandruff. The periodicity may be an intrinsic feature of human skin. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Case summary A 10 -year-old male {{neutered}} British Shorthair cat {{was presented}} with a 6 month history of lethargy, weight loss and alopecia. Clinical examination revealed widespread alopecia of the ventral abdomen and hindlimbs. The skin in these areas was smooth and shiny and hairs could be easily epilated. Spontaneous pruritus was observed. Cytological examination of superficial impression smears showed a severe Malassezia species dermatitis and pyoderma. Ectoparasites could not be detected and no sign of dermatophytosis was visible in <b>trichograms</b> and Wood’s lamp analysis. Abdominal ultrasound found a focally thickened wall of the large intestine and multiple nodules in the liver. Fine-needle aspirates from lymph nodes, liver and altered colonic wall were consistent with an undifferentiated malignant neoplasia. The cat was euthanased at the owners’ request, owing to potential neoplasia with metastatic spread. At necropsy a metastasising carcinoma of the colonic wall was found, {{as well as a}} paraneoplastic alopecia. Relevance and novel information Feline paraneoplastic alopecia has been reported in association with pancreatic carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as with neuroendocrine pancreatic carcinoma and hepatosplenic plasma cell tumour.

40|$|Androgenetic {{alopecia}} (AGA) is {{a common}} yet poorly understood condition. In particular, the significance of inflammatory cells close to the infrainfundibulum of transitional hairs remains obscure. This {{study was conducted in}} 20 men who used a lotion containing the antimicrobials, piroctone olamine and triclosan, regularly for 18 months. At entry, mild pruritus and abnormal hair loss were reported by the volunteers. During treatments, pruritus resolved rapidly. Comparison of clinical photographs and <b>trichograms</b> taken at 3 -month intervals suggested signs of hair regrowth with moderate increase in density of transitional hairs. Biopsies taken at 6 -month intervals were processed for immunohistochemistry. There was a decrease in the density of activated T cells in the region of the follicular infrainfundibulum and isthmus over time. UgG deposits found within the epithelial sheaths at entry to the study were absent in the subsequent biopsies. The volume of the sebaceous glands, as assessed by computerized morphometry, was not modified by the treatment. It was concluded that inflammation associated with AGA transitional hairs may be driven by the presence of microorganisms harboured in the infrainfundibulum. They may modulate the severity of AGA and may potentially be controllable. This offers a new possibility of prevention and partial reversal of hair loss in AGA. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Various {{methods are}} {{available}} for evaluation (for diagnosis and/or quantification) of a patient presenting with hair loss. Hair evaluation methods are grouped into three main categories: Non-invasive methods (e. g., questionnaire, daily hair counts, standardized wash test, 60 -s hair count, global photographs, dermoscopy, hair weight, contrasting felt examination, phototrichogram, TrichoScan and polarizing and surface electron microscopy), semi-invasive methods (e. g., <b>trichogram</b> and unit area <b>trichogram)</b> and invasive methods (e. g., scalp biopsy). Any single method is neither 'ideal' nor feasible. However, when interpreted with caution, these are valuable tools for patient diagnosis and monitoring. Daily hair counts, wash test, etc. are good methods for primary evaluation of the patient and to get an approximate assessment {{of the amount of}} shedding. Some methods like global photography form an important part of any hair clinic. Analytical methods like phototrichogram are usually possible only in the setting of a clinical trial. Many of these methods (like the scalp biopsy) require expertise for both processing and interpreting. We reviewed the available literature in detail in light of merits and demerits of each method.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the sensitivity of deep skin scraping, hair plucking, and exudate microscopy for the diagnosis of canine demodicosis. Sixty-seven dogs diagnosed with demodicosis were enrolled in the study. Thirty dogs had localized and 37 had generalized demodicosis. Twenty-seven of the 67 dogs had complicated (secondarily infected) and 40 had noncomplicated form. On each dog, a single lesion was randomly selected to obtain one deep skin scraping, hair plucking, and, when present (n = 13) exudate. For skin scraping and exudate microscopy, an area under a cover slip measuring 2. 2 x 2. 2 mm was examined, while trichography included the evaluation of 100 hair shafts. At least one parasitic element was found in 85. 1 % of <b>trichograms,</b> and 100 % of exudate preparations. The number of parasitic elements was higher in skin scrapings compared to the other two methods. The diagnostic sensitivity of skin scrapings was higher than that of hair pluckings for the total number of samples (P = 0. 002) and for those obtained from dogs with the localized (P = 0. 004) and the noncomplicated (P = 0. 002) forms of the disease. The diagnostic sensitivity of hair pluckings was higher in generalized and complicated demodicosis compared to the localized and noncomplicated variants. Based on these results, exudate microscopy may be equally sensitive to deep skin scrapings, and trichography may be of value in generalized and complicated demodicosis, although a negative result cannot rule it out...|$|R
40|$|Hair {{shedding}} {{and hair}} thinning {{have been reported}} to be affected by dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis. The present study was conducted in 150 men presenting with telogen effluvium related to androgenic alopecia associated with dandruff. They were randomly allocated to three groups receiving each one of the three shampoos in the market containing either 1 % ketoconazole (KTZ), 1 % piroctone olamine (PTO) or 1 % zinc pyrithione (ZPT). Shampoos had to be used 2 - 3 times a week for 6 months. Hair shedding during shampoo was evaluated semiquantitatively. Hair density on the vertex was evaluated on photographs using a Dermaphot. <b>Trichograms</b> were used for determining the anagen hair percentage and the mean proximal hair shaft diameter using computerized image analysis. The sebum excretion rate (SER, mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)) was also measured using a Sebumeter((R)). The three treatments cleared pruritus and dandruff rapidly. At end point, hair density was unchanged, although hair shedding was decreased (KTZ: - 17. 3 %, PTO: - 16. 5 %, ZPT: - 10. 1 %) and the anagen hair percentage was increased (KTZ: 4. 9 %, PTO: 7. 9 %, ZPT: 6. 8 %). The effect on the mean hair shaft diameter was contrasted between the three groups of volunteers (KTZ: 5. 4 %, PTO: 7. 7 %, ZPT: - 2. 2 %). In conclusion, telogen effluvium was controlled by KTZ, PTO and ZPT shampoos at 1 % concentration.

40|$|Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) {{has emerged}} as a new {{treatment}} modality in regenerative plastic surgery, and preliminary evidence suggests that it might have a beneficial role in hair regrowth. Here, we report the results of a randomized, evaluator-blinded, placebo-controlled, half-head group study to compare, with the aid of computerized <b>trichograms,</b> hair regrowth with PRP versus placebo. The safety and clinical efficacy of autologous PRP injections for pattern hair loss were investigated. PRP, prepared from a small volume of blood, was injected on half of the selected patients' scalps with pattern hair loss. The other half was treated with placebo. Three treatments were administered to each patient at 30 -day intervals. The endpoints were hair regrowth, hair dystrophy as measured by dermoscopy, burning or itching sensation, and cell proliferation as measured by Ki 67 evaluation. Patients were followed for 2 years. Of the 23 patients were enrolled, 3 were excluded. At the end of the 3 treatment cycles, the patients presented clinical improvement in the mean number of hairs, with a mean increase of 33. 6 hairs in the target area, and a mean increase in total hair density of 45. 9 hairs per cm(2) compared with baseline values. No side effects were noted during treatment. Microscopic evaluation showed the increase of epidermis thickness and of the number of hair follicles 2 weeks after the last PRP treatment compared with baseline value (p <. 05). We also observed an increase of Ki 67 (+) keratinocytes in the epidermis and of hair follicular bulge cells, and a slight increase of small blood vessels around hair follicles in the treated skin compared with baseline (p <. 05). Relapse of androgenic alopecia was not evaluated in all patients until 12 months after the last treatment. After 12 months, 4 patients reported progressive hair loss; this was more evident 16 months after the last treatment. Those four patients were re-treated. Our data clearly highlight the positive effects of PRP injections on male pattern hair loss and absence of major side effects.

40|$|Mouse models {{show that}} {{experimental}} stress mimicking prolonged life-stress exposure enhances neurogenic inflammation, induces adaptive immunity cytokine-imbalance {{characterized by a}} shift to Type 1 T-helper cell cytokines and increases apoptosis of epithelial cells. This affects hair growth in otherwise healthy animals. In this study, we investigate whether a prolonged naturalistic life-stress exposure affects cytokine balance and hair parameters in healthy humans. 33 (18 exam, 15 comparison) female medical students with comparable sociobiological status were analyzed during a stressful final examination period, at three points in time (T) 12 weeks apart. T 1 was before start of the learning period, T 2 between the three-day written exam and an oral examination, and T 3 after a 12 week rest and recovery from {{the stress of the}} examination period. Assessments included: self-reported distress and coping strategies (Perceived Stress Questionnaire [PSQ], Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress [TICS]), COPE), cytokines in supernatants of stimulated peripheral blood mononucleocytes (PBMCs), and <b>trichogram</b> (hair cycle and pigmentation analysis). Comparison between students participating in the final medical exam at T 2 and non-exam students, revealed significantly higher stress perception in exam students. Time-wise comparison revealed that stress level, TH 1 /TH 2 cytokine balance and hair parameters changed significantly from T 1 to T 2 in the exam group, but not the control. However, no group differences were found for cytokine balance or hair parameters at T 2. The study concludes that in humans, naturalistic stress, as perceived during participation in a major medical exam, has the potential to shift the immune response to TH 1 and transiently hamper hair growth, but these changes stay within a physiological range. Findings are instructive for patients suffering from hair loss in times of high stress.

40|$|Hair {{plays an}} {{important}} role in human social and sexual communication. The androgen-stimulated, patterned loss of hair in cases of androgenetic alopecia (or common baldness) in genetically pre-disposed individuals, is associated with ageing and can cause marked phychological distress. However, it is poorly controlled. To investigate the effectiveness of daily topical application of a Chinese medicine-derived herbal mixture, Xiantene, on balding progression, two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (3 and 12 months) were carried out on balding men using the <b>trichogram</b> approach. Xiantene significantly increased both the total number of hairs and those in anagen, improving the ratio of anagen:telogen hairs. This suggests that topical Xiantene increased the length of the anagen phase and may promote a cessation, or partial reversal, of the progression of androgenetic alopecia in men. Canities, loss of scalp hair colour, is another mark of ageing. To investigate whether early greying may protect follicles from androgenetic alopecia, the extent of alopecia, assessed using the Hamilton scale, was compared between men who first became grey before, or after, 30. Both alopecia and greying increased with age in 843 men (217 European, 626 Thai) whenever they first started greying. However, men who showed greying before 30 were significantly less bald, though more grey, in both groups. Hair follicle melanocytes synthesise the pigment melanin, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress; losing melanocyte pigmentary activity, and therefore these toxic factors, appears to enable hair follicles to maintain their full size for longer, despite the androgen drive to miniaturisation.

Eighty client-owned dogs undergoing surgery were randomly assigned to one of three epidural treatment groups: either morphine and bupivacaine (MB), bupivacaine (B), or saline solution 0. 9 % (S) was administered epidurally to these patients. Ten dogs were only clipped in the lumbosacral area (C). Follow-up started 4 weeks after clipping and was performed every 4 – 5 weeks in cases of delayed hair re-growth or pruritus. Hair re-growth in the lumbosacral area was observed and compared to hair re-growth in the surgical field and the fentanyl patch area. Cytological analysis and a <b>trichogram</b> were performed if hair re-growth was delayed after 6 months. Time interval to first urination postoperatively was recorded (n = 80). Results: Hair re-growth was delayed in 11 dogs (12. 2 %; B: n = 7, S: n = 2, MB: n = 1, C: n = 1) with no differences between groups. Pruritus was evident in two dogs (2. 2 %; MB: n = 1, S: n = 1).

40|$|Introduction and Objective: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an {{autologous}} {{preparation of}} platelets in concentrated plasma. The platelet {{is a natural}} source of different growth factors and cytokines. These growth factors act on stem cells in the bulge area of the follicles and stimulate {{the development of new}} follicles, and promote neovascularization. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the efficacy and safety of PRP injections in androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in men. Patients and Methods: Fifteen male patients (mean age: 39 ± 9. 7 years) with AGA grades III–VI were enrolled in the study. Five injections of 2 – 4 ml PRP (Regenlab PRP Kit-RegenACR®, Le Mont-sur-Lausanne Switzerland) by single spin process were administered every 2 weeks. Standard photographs, <b>trichogram,</b> and measurement of hair density and diameter in an area marked with a tattoo (with digital photographic hair analyzer) were done at baseline and 3 months after the last injection. In addition, patients completed a patient satisfaction questionnaire at each visit on a − 2 to + 2 score (− 2 : much worse, − 1 : slightly worse, 0 : without change, + 1 : slightly better, + 2 : much better). Results: Thirteen patients completed the study. The number of hairs increased slightly from 149. 62 ± 49. 56 to 168. 46 ± 43. 703 /cm 2, however, this increase was not statistically significant (P = 0. 24). On the other hand, the thickness of hairs decreased from 0. 051 ± 0. 105 to 0. 045 ± 0. 011 mm, which was also not significant (P = 0. 37). There was a significant decrease in anagen hairs and increase in telogen hairs, and anagen/telogen ratio decreased significantly from 6. 38 ± 4. 57 to 2. 67 ± 1. 87 (P = 0. 003). Conclusion: Our study could not show any benefit from PRP injections in the treatment of male AGA. There is a strong need for well-designed, randomized controlled trials with large sample size, proper control group, standard treatment protocols (concerning the amount, number and interval of PRP injections, method of preparation and activation, etc.), and long follow-up periods to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRP in the treatment of male AGA...|$|E
40|$|Scalp hair is {{increasingly}} {{being used as}} a testing substrate for toxins and monitoring treatment adherence. The biochemistry of human hair is assumed to be similar; however, a recent study reported higher concentration of lipids in African hair. The effect of hair curvature, if any, on drug incorporation (e. g. lipid soluble drugs) is unknown. Racial description of hair morphology is unscientific. A geometric classification of hair into 8 groups (I-straight to VIII-tightly curly) was recently proposed, however its reliability has not been confirmed. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the reliability of the geometric classification (and to assess whether it could be improved) and investigate relationships between morphology and other hair characteristics. Virgin hair was collected from 128 volunteers using a standardized protocol. Geometric measurements of hair using published templates were conducted for classification. Reliability was assessed using Kappa statistics. Characteristics assessed included mechanical properties (miniature tensile tester), growth rate and hair density (TrichoScan® <b>trichogram),</b> biochemistry (Vanillin assay for lipids and Fourier Transform Infrared adsorption) and imaging (Electron and Fluorescent Light Microscopy). Inter-observer agreement was poor for 8 -groups (k= 0. 418) but improved for 6 -groups (k= 0. 671). The intra-observer agreement also improved [ranges: k= 0. 444 to 0. 648 (8 -groups) and k= 0. 599 to 0. 836 (6 -groups) ]. The yield strength of all hair groups was higher than reported for racially grouped samples. Curly hair groups had lower growth rates and tensile strengths. The TrichoScan based growth rate was for fastest for the straightest (0. 72 ± 0. 3 cm/month) and slowest for the curliest (0. 39 ± 0. 2 cm/month) hair. No correlation with biochemistry was detected for either the 8 or 6 -group classification, although a trend toward higher absorption of lipid (C-H) bands was noted for curly hair. A supervised statistical approach applied to 4 hair groups using the FTIR data improved classification success to 79 % (range: 69 % - 88 %), which needs confirmation but would be more objective than using race for hair testing in Medicine and Forensic Science. This thesis supports a geometric classification with fewer groups (6, based kappa statistics and 4, based on biochemistry); it is also the first to report correlations between hair geometry, biochemistry and physical properties...|$|E
