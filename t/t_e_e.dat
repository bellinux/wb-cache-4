40|$|This study {{examined}} the literacy achievement of first year Bachelor of Arts (Primary Education) students at the Mount Lawley Campus of the Edith Cowan University. It had been suggested that these students possessed inadequate levels of literacy to function as competent teachers. Students are assumed to have adequate literacy ability for the Bachelor of Arts course, and thus the teaching profession, when they receive a pass mark in their <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> English or English Literature examination. This {{study examined}} {{the correlation between the}} <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> English score and the scores the students received on three other instruments measuring aspects of literacy. The assessment scores firstly provided an indication of the literacy ability of each individual student, specifically indicating areas of higher or lower achievement. The correlation coefficients indicated {{the degree to which the}} <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> English scores related to scores from other measures of literacy. In summary, this study investigated the claims that the students studying for a Bachelor of Arts (Primary Education) do not possess adequate levels of literacy essential for their chosen profession. Upon analysis of the results, it was concluded that the <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> English Examination could predict, to some degree, the literacy ability of students. However, the results indicate that the <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> English Examination is not a strong enough predictor to assess a student 2 ̆ 7 s literacy ability. In conclusion, the <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> English Examination is not a good predictor of literacy ability. It may be necessary for tertiary institutions to consider other instruments to measure the literacy ability of students. From the study it is also suggested that tertiary institutions conduct literacy skills development courses to upgrade the literacy skills of students.

40|$|Estimated {{rates of}} obesity are notably {{high in the}} United States and pose a {{significant}} public health concern. A number of deleterious physical and psychosocial conditions are associated with pediatric obesity {{and the cost of}} its treatment is considerable. Accordingly, the number of weight management treatments has increased to meet this growing public health challenge. Unfortunately, insufficient participation in weight management treatment, namely low adherence and high attrition, often impede the effectiveness of these programs. Although the barriers associated with inadequate adherence and elevated rates of attrition are documented, there is a dearth of research on the predictors of the low participation in pediatric weight management. To address this gap in the literature, the current study examined whether psychosocial (e. g., motivation, mindfulness, depression), biological (e. g., anthropometric, biochemical), and demographic variables predicted adherence and attrition. A series of backward elimination regressions were modeled to identify the biopsychosocial factors that best predicted adherence and attrition in a pediatric weight management program. The study utilized a sample of parent-adolescent dyads (N = 143) from the <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> N. S. program, a multidisciplinary weight management treatment involving behavioral, nutrition, and exercise components for adolescents with obesity. Several demographic characteristics were associated with lower adherence. Parent basic psychological need fulfillment was also significantly associated with six-month attrition. This finding underscores the importance of the parents’ role in the successful completion of a pediatric weight management program. This study contributes to an increased understanding of the factors related to participation in weight management programs, and can inform the refinements of interventions, such as <b>T.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>E.</b> N.

Let us consider a simple system in which a rigid perfectly plastic disk is covered by a fluid, whose viscosity is independent of pres-sure, and then compressed.

Unsafe sex was common among ages 15 to 25, and often led to unplanned pregnancy or contraction of sexually transmitted infections.

But for something that has begun to become a normal topic of conversation, unplanned pregnancy rates and STIs continue to remain high, especially among the teenage population. Although STIs are a concern, teen pregnancy is more of a concern and comes with many consequences. We zoomed in to the state of New Jersey, which ranked 20 th out of the 50 united states for teen pregnancy (12), too display how the problem hits home for many.
