The Karmapa, on horseback, traced the Buddha's outline with hoofprints.

500|$|Although nothing {{remains of}} either the body or the bed, {{surviving}} artefacts and the 56 pieces of ironwork that held the bed together have enabled the burial to be reconstructed in considerable detail. The bed was made from ash wood, held together {{with a variety of}} iron plates, cleats, staples, nails, stays, and decorative scrolls. It measured [...] and may once have been roofed with an ornamental awning or canvas, perhaps made of cloth draped over timber posts. <b>Traces</b> of mineralised <b>cloth</b> and either grass or reed were found still attached to some of the nails, indicating the possible nature of the mattress. Two pieces of ironwork showed signs of repair and reuse, suggesting that the bed had been in use some time before the burial and was not specially made for the interment. This raises the possibility that the bed was either that of the deceased woman or a significant bed of some other person. It may have been dismantled elsewhere, brought to the cemetery and reassembled and repaired so that it could be used for the burial.|$|R

5000|$|The {{broadest}} artistic license {{required in}} bringing the Indus Valley civilization to cinema, inevitably, would be costuming. Because although [...] "undisputed <b>traces</b> of cotton <b>cloth</b> have survived at Mohenjo-Daro" [...] and the Indus culture is believed by archaeologists to have pioneered the cultivation of cotton for clothmaking in the ancient world, no actual samples of finished clothing or other organic matter have survived over these four thousand years, due to the [...] "damp alkalkine soil" [...] prevailing at the Indus sites. Thus, the only reference material is the relative handful (compared with the broad abundance of seals found, or commercial items such as weights and measures) of terracotta humanoid figurines or small stone statues found at various excavations, which are mostly only partially intact and of mostly unknown purpose—but male or female, are mostly naked. Some of the female figures, for instance, wear elaborate headdresses and jewellery but little else. Explained the director in an interview, [...] "I cannot make a movie with so much nudity, obviously. So I had to create and imagine a costume which will be away from all the different styles {{that we have seen}} in other movies, and yet be special for this civilization." ...|$|R
2500|$|On September 22, 1827, Joseph and Emma took a {{horse and}} {{carriage}} belonging to Joseph Knight, Sr., {{and went to a}} hill now known as the Hill Cumorah where Joseph said he received a set of golden plates. This created a great deal of excitement in the area. In December 1827, the couple decided to move to Harmony, where they reconciled—to some extent—with Isaac and Elizabeth Hale. Emma's parents helped her and Joseph obtain a house and a small farm. Once they settled in, Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon with Emma acting as a scribe. She became a physical witness of the plates, reporting that she felt them through a <b>cloth,</b> <b>traced</b> the pages through the cloth with her fingers, heard the metallic sound they made as she moved them, and felt their weight. She later wrote in an interview with her son, Joseph Smith III: [...] "In writing for your father I frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us." [...] In Harmony on June 15, 1828, Emma gave birth to her first child—a son named Alvin—who lived only a few hours.|$|R
