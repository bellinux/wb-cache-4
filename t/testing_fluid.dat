40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityA new method has been developed for the measurement of fluid thermal diffusivity. In this method, the fluid boundaries do not affect the measurement, bulk temperature is not altered, and discrimination between conduction and radiation is achieved. In addition, a small quantity of <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> is required. Typically measurements utilize one cc of <b>test</b> <b>fluid,</b> but measurements on a "drop" of fluid (approximately 0. 01 cc) have been performed. The system employs a pulsed laser coupled to a metallurgical microscope in order to deposit thermal energy in a local region (approximately 40 micrometers) of the <b>test</b> <b>fluid.</b> Microthermocouples with junctions of less then ten micrometers have been prepared¹, and are used to detect the resulting thermal transients in the <b>test</b> <b>fluid.</b> The microthermocouple signal is amplified and digitally stored; the addition of repetitive pulses enables signal averaging for greater accuracy than would be possible with the utilization of single events. A two dimensional computer program was written to analyze the transient heat transfer problem Involved in this method. Specific analytic consideration {{was given to the}} question of contact resistance at the fluid-energy source interface, and to the perturbation of the measured time by the presence of a microthermocouple detector. In the first case, it was determined that the effect was negligible for this transient type of measurement.

40|$|AbstractThe {{optically}} transparent {{model is}} one of the key components of an experimental set-up dedicated to PIV investigations of internal flows. The accuracy of the PIV results is strongly dependent on the quality of the images captured during the investigation. A prerequisite condition in order to assure the appropriate quality of the PIV images is that of avoiding scattered light, diminishing reflections and refractions of the light. These disturbing phenomena occur especially at the interface between the curved walls and the working fluid. In order to avoid them, the material of the model and the working fluid should comply with the Refractive Index Matching (RIM) condition. This means that they should have, as much as possible, similar or very close values to the refractive indices. Despite the fact that a lot of possible pairs of material-working fluid complying with the RIM condition are presented in literature, the choice is difficult with regard to the possibility of using them effectively in the experimental set-up. Health and safety, the risk of corrosion, availability, technology limitations and fabrication costs should be taken into account.
