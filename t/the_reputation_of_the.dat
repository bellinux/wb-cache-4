5|$|Due to {{the diverse}} range of {{accounting}} services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession. These collapses {{have resulted in a}} widespread disregard for <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounting profession. To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting, various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession.|$|E
5|$|However, {{safety issues}} {{continue}} to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{proved an}} embarrassment to <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised {{at home and abroad}} through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio {{composed}} by Erwin Schulhoff. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.|$|E

50|$|After a {{protracted}} development period, the Swift entered service as an interceptor aircraft with the RAF in 1954. However, {{due to a}} spate of accidents incurred by the type, the Swift was grounded for a time, and experienced a relatively brief service life.

5|$|David Margoliouth (professor 1889–1937) {{taught the}} {{syllabus}} {{for the final}} examinations in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts {{in their first year}} of study. Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian Professor , was appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years at Croydon, girls tended to be {{enrolled}} at an older age, typically over fourteen. It was apparent that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. As today, {{it was not a}} requirement for students to be Presbyterians, and early school records indicate {{there were a number of}} Roman Catholic and Jewish students. By 1900 <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wines that came from this area. The Counts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count of Champagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region {{became part of the}} Crown territories.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mars Works grew, so too did {{the demand}} for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began {{exporting}} its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated {{a great deal of}} interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E

25|$|The Knicks have {{a strong}} rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry's most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders. This {{intensity}} was due to a variety <b>of</b> factors: <b>the</b> great frequency in which the teams competed {{against each other in}} high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; <b>the</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams.|$|R
50|$|Eric's {{succession}} overrode <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> earlier monarchs, {{counter to}} <b>the</b> dictates <b>of</b> agnatic seniority. However, since <b>the</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sons <b>of</b> Abel of Denmark were tainted by acts of fratricide and murder, it was {{relatively easy to}} ignore their claims to the throne. Even so, during his reign, Christopher I made sure that his own son succeeded. <b>The</b> accession <b>of</b> Christopher's son, Eric V led to serious rivalry for generations, yet Christopher's line was able to successfully retain their claim to the Danish throne.|$|R
5|$|Built {{around long}} narrow yards, {{as well as}} serving food and drink and {{providing}} lodgings, these coaching inns also served as temporary warehouses, auction rooms and gambling halls for travellers {{doing business in the}} market. The best known was the Angel, parts of which dated to the 15thcentury. As well as providing the other functions of the Norwich inns, its yard also served as a popular theatre and venue for other performers. (Despite its significance as a city, Norwich did not have a dedicated theatre until 1758.) However, in 1699 part of the building collapsed during a performance by Thomas Doggett's troupe of players, killing a woman and injuring many of the audience. <b>The</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Angel was severely damaged, and although still used for small scale entertainments such as puppet shows, it was never again used for full scale theatrical performances.|$|E
5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling him and his wife. As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless {{they were willing to}} go without royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte of engaging in an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of the}} family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchy.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E
50|$|Bloom {{began his}} career by {{defending}} <b>the</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Romantics through a sequence of highly regarded monographs beginning with his doctoral dissertation on Percy Bysshe Shelley, (Shelley's Myth-making, Yale University Press), W. B. Yeats, (Yeats, Oxford University Press), and Wallace Stevens, (Wallace Stevens: <b>The</b> Poems <b>of</b> Our Climate, Cornell University Press) against neo-Christian critics influenced by such writers as T. S. Eliot, who became a recurring intellectual foil. He had a contentious approach: his first book, Shelley's Myth-making, charged many contemporary critics with sheer carelessness in their reading of Shelley.|$|R

5|$|In 972 A.D., {{during the}} rule of Khottiga Amoghavarsha, the Paramara King Siyaka Harsha {{attacked}} the empire and plundered Manyakheta, {{the capital of the}} Rashtrakutas. This seriously undermined <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall. The final decline was sudden as Tailapa II, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern Bijapur district, declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat. Indra IV, the last emperor, committed Sallekhana (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at Shravanabelagola. With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The Western Chalukyas annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century. The focus of dominance shifted to the Krishna River– Godavari River doab called Vengi. The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas, and the hitherto-suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south.|$|E
5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich {{framed the}} McKinley Tariff that {{would raise the}} tariff even higher, {{including}} making some rates intentionally prohibitive. At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E

5|$|The British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, {{which later}} became the Bristol Aeroplane Company, then part of the British Aircraft Company and finally BAE Systems, was founded by Sir George White, owner of Bristol Tramways in 1910.

The main base at Filton is still a prominent manufacturing site for BAE Systems in the 21st century. The Bristol Aeroplane Company's engine department became a subsidiary company Bristol Aero Engines, then Bristol Siddeley Engines; and were bought by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966, to become Rolls-Royce plc which is still based at Filton. Shipbuilding in the city docks, predominately by Charles Hill & Sons, formerly Hilhouse, remained important until the 1970s. Other prominent industries included chocolate manufacturers J. S. Fry & Sons and wine and sherry importers John Harvey & Sons.|$|E
5|$|The terms {{by which}} Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were {{that he should}} remove his forts and armies on the {{frontier}} at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum. Since the Sultan had already failed to keep {{his side of the}} earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum. Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert, 105 years earlier, to restore <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire. Yet because of his over-confidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century. In western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models {{and the park}} fell into disrepair {{as the years went}} by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
