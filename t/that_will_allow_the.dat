For Gramsci, the complex nature of modern civil society means that a 'war of position', carried out by revolutionaries through political agitation, the trade unions, advancement of proletarian culture, and other ways to create an opposing civil society was necessary alongside a 'war of manoeuvre' – a direct revolution – {{in order to have}} a successful revolution without a danger of a counter-revolution or degeneration.|$|E

25|$|Distressed {{vessels that}} request {{the service of}} towing vessels have means to make towing as safe as possible.

Bulk carriers and general cargo vessels {{are not required to}} have a specialized emergency towing arrangement. Depending on the vessel's type and keel laid date, in accordance with the MSC256(84) standard they must have on board an emergency towing procedure manual. This ship-specific manual describes procedures <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> vessel to be towed using its own equipment.

50|$|The {{hospital}} {{had been wrong}} in its claim <b>that</b> <b>Will</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> stay, according to Brennan, because it relied on Rehnquist's plurality opinion in that case, which {{had the support of}} only three other justices.

Therefore Colorado River was still controlling. Will also differed from the instant case in that it did not involve a mandamus writ, Brennan observed.|$|R

However, it is absent in Agelaia and instead, it is hypothesized that the van der Vecht’s gland is the alternative source for the communicative pheromone. By rubbing their gastral on objects, they leave a pheromone trail for their worker counterparts to follow suit.|$|E
