500|$|Cori {{was born}} in Prague (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now the Czech Republic). Gerty was not a nickname, but rather she was named after an Austrian warship. Growing up {{at a time when}} women were marginalized in science and allowed few {{educational}} opportunities, she [...] gained admittance to medical school, where she met her future husband Carl Ferdinand Cori; upon their graduation in 1920, they married. Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research findings coauthored [...] with her husband, as well as publishing singly.

500|$|Hoping {{to write}} a song that would {{successfully}} [...] "portray [...] {{in a world that}} is so protected and safe", Ashman and Menken drew inspiration from a story-telling style that is often reserved for traditional operettas. As Beauty and the Beasts opening number, [...] "Belle", a [...] "pivotal moment...in the narrative", plays a significant role in the film by introducing both the film's heroine, Belle, after whom the song is named, and Gaston, the film's villain. While Belle, a book-loving and intelligent nonconformist who has grown frustrated with her predictable village life, longs for an adventure similar to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> reads about in her books, Gaston is a narcissistic hunter who seeks her hand in marriage. In roughly five minutes, the song explains both Belle and Gaston's roles in Beauty and the Beast to the audience. The song also voices the opinions of the townsfolk and [...] "sets up the overall theme and foreshadows what makes the town so oppressive to [...] "; [...] while the villagers award Belle high praise for her doubtless Beauty, they see her as odd because of her love of books and ridicule her for her non-conformity. However, they appraise Gaston for his looks and masculinity.|$|E

500|$|Chastain next took on {{the lead}} role of a {{musician}} who is forced {{to care for her}} boyfriend's troubled nieces in the horror film Mama (2013). She was attracted to the idea of playing a woman drastically different from the [...] "perfect mother" [...] roles she had played in Take Shelter and The Tree of Life, and she based her character's look on the singer Alice Glass. The critic Richard Roeper noted how different the role was from <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> had previously played, and considered it as proof of her being one of the best actors of her generation. During the film's opening weekend in North America, Chastain became the first performer in 15 years to have leading roles in the top two films (Mama and Zero Dark Thirty) at the box office. Mama eventually earned $146 million worldwide. She then starred as the titular character of a depressed woman who separates from her husband (played by James McAvoy) following a tragic incident in the drama The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby (2013), which she also produced. The writer-director Ned Benson initially wrote the story from the perspective of Rigby's husband, then wrote a separate version from Rigby's perspective on the insistence of Chastain. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival in two parts, Him and Her. A third part told from both their perspectivessubtitled Themwas released separately. The film did not find a wide audience, but the critic A. O. Scott praised Chastain for [...] "short-circuit conventional distinctions between tough and vulnerable, showing exquisite control even when her character is losing it, and keeping her balance even when the movie pitches and rolls toward melodrama".|$|E
500|$|In the 1950 Technicolor western, Comanche Territory, O'Hara {{played an}} unusual {{role as the}} lead {{character}} of Katie Howards, a fiery saloon owner who dresses, behaves and fights like a man, with hair tied back. She [...] "mastered the American bullwhip" [...] during the filming, [...] in a role which Crowther believed was [...] "more significant than a setting sun" [...] in that she [...] "tackles her assignment with so much relish {{that the rest of}} the cast, even the Indians, are completely subdued." [...] She received first billing above co-star Macdonald Carey. O'Hara then appeared as Countess D'Arneau opposite John Payne in Tripoli, directed by O'Hara's second husband, William Houston Price. She was next cast by John Ford in the western Rio Grande, the final installment of his cavalry trilogy. It was the first of five films to be made over 22 years with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), McLintock! (1963) and Big Jake (1971), the first three of which were directed by Ford. O'Hara declared that [...] "from our very first scenes together, working with John Wayne was comfortable for me". Her chemistry with Wayne was so powerful that over the years many people assumed that they were married, and newspapers occasionally published sensationalist stories from people claiming to be their love child. In April 1951, she received a call from Universal Pictures that she was cast as a Tunisian princess named Tanya in the swashbuckler film, Flame of Araby (1951). O'Hara [...] "despised" [...] the film and everything it stood for, [...] but had no choice but to make the film or be suspended. By that point of time, she began to grow tired of the roles she was offered and wanted to perform roles that had more depth than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> had done thus far.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{provides}} {{all of her}} character's vocals {{for both}} the film and its soundtrack. Because she does not consider herself a professional singer, Pfeiffer's inhibitions about singing on camera initially contributed to her early reservations about accepting the role, having not done so since her performance in Grease 2; The Fabulous Baker Boys would mark Pfeiffer's first professional singing role in seven years. Despite Kloves' insistence that Pfeiffer's singing voice not be dubbed, composer Dave Grusin was initially skeptical about Pfeiffer's musical abilities until she ultimately convinced him with her rendition of [...] "My Funny Valentine". For four months (although sources differ, citing any period of time between two months to an entire year), the actress took extensive singing lessons {{under the tutelage of}} voice coach Sally Stevens in preparation for the role, at the suggestion of Grusin. In addition to performing vocal exercises to strengthen her vocal chords, Pfeiffer would often work 10-hour days in the recording studio before finally returning home to listen to and study her own recordings. Already impressed with Pfeiffer's rhythm and phrasing, Stevens trained the actress to avoid pronouncing words in ways that would make the film's jazz standards sound too much like rock songs; Stevens jokenly linkened Pfeiffer's original pronunciation to musician Bob Dylan, and recording the songs for Pfieffer to use as reference for enunciation, teaching the actress about using her teeth and mouth to pronounce words and smiling to [...] "lift" [...] her pitch. Admitting that the film's songs were much more difficult than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> had performed in Grease 2, Pfeiffer worked especially hard on improving her phrasing because the material for The Fabulous Baker Boys were different than the pop music she had grown more accustomed to singing, explaining, [...] "Those older songs were written for singers; they weren't written for synthesizers and drums... It was an entirely new way of listening to songs." [...] Additionally, the actress drew inspiration from real-life lounge singers performing at The Hollyood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, while listening to jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Rickie Lee Jones, Billie Holiday and Helen Merrill for inspiration, maintaining, [...] "I didn't copy anybody, but I heard a lot. For me, it helps to act the song out." [...] Pfeiffer incorporated the [...] "undercurrent of anger" [...] in the lounge singer's performances, drawn from the fact that [...] "a lot of club singers... haven't had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for" [...] into her own interpretation of Susie. Stevens encouraged Pfeiffer to envision herself as Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in the film Casablanca (1942) while recording [...] "More Than You Know" [...] for the film's soundtrack, which the actress identified as one of her favorite songs. Stevens also suggested that Pfeiffer research jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald because Fitzgerald possesses [...] "a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character Susie might have listened to", describing the end result as [...] "an airy alto, a nice breathy quality, and intelligence in delivery". Despite her extensive training, the vocal coach felt it was important that Susie's voice sound [...] "pleasant" [...] but still untrained. Kloves maintains that he did not hire Pfeiffer based on her singing abilities, but rather because {{of the way in which}} she uses her acting abilities to interpret lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1993 election, the party set about reforming its policies and purpose, with McLaughlin announcing on April 18, 1994, that she would step down as leader by 1996. McLaughlin, faced with internal squabbles similar to those that occurred in the Nova Scotia party back in 1980, advanced her departure from the end of 1996 to the end of 1995. With an internal party atmosphere that could best be described as toxic, McDonough entered the leadership race in the spring of 1995. The conditions were similar to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> faced during her first leadership campaign in 1980: a divided party that was self-immolating.

2500|$|By the {{syndicated}} run, the storylines had clearly started to mature.

Early in the third season, Allen moved away to Kansas with his mother, following his parents' divorce. As Punky herself embarked on junior high, her avant-garde day-glo and multicolored attire, along with her pigtails, segued into more traditional teenage styles, and her declaration of, and reliance on [...] "Punky Power!"

Gold tried to tell Emma that being the Dark One would cost her <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> loved, but she didn’t want to listen.

Emma, heeding Gold's words, was having second thoughts about everything as she went to her shed full of dreamcatchers and cried. As they arrive in the woods, Merida began putting Gold to work on making him a hero, but he is shown to be weak, which infuriated the Scottish archer from DunBroch. She then finds something that he can fight for by showing him Belle's chipped teacup, then taunts Gold on how cowardly he was, even to Belle. Gold immediately takes the sword and swings at Merida, who stops and tells him that what he did was an act of bravery, he was not thinking about himself or his limp: he was thinking of her.
