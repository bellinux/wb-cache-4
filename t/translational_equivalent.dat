The study of lexical gaps can be approached from the point of view of lexical fields, as suggested by Alan Cruse and Adrienne Lehrer among others. In this approach different fields: taxonomies, hierarchies, clusters, grids, linear structures and matrixes help to organize the lexicon into conceptual structures where the missing structural part is then best observable and studied with relation to the other units in the field.

40|$|Natural {{language}} processing for regional languages and dialects faces {{a certain number}} of challenges. First, the amount of electronically available written texts is small. Second, these data are most often not annotated, and spelling may not be standardized. These challenges can be – at least partially – overcome by using an etymologically closely related language with more resources (we call this language resourced language in the following). However, in most such configurations, parallel corpora are not available: since two closely related languages are generally mutually intelligible, the demand for translation (which constitutes the sourced of parallel corpora) is low. In this communication, we describe various experiments based on our part-of-speech tagging approach (see also Das & Petrov 2011). Concretely, we transfer existing part-of-speech annotations from the resourced language to the non-resourced (regional) language, withouth using bilingual (i. e., parallel) data during this process. This approach relies on two hypotheses. First, we assume that both languages share a lot of cognate pairs, i. e., word pairs that are formally similar and that are translations of each other. Second, we admit that the word order is similar in both languages, and that the set of POS tags is identical. Under these hypotheses, the POS tag of one word can be transferred to its <b>translational</b> <b>equivalent</b> in the other language. The proposed approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we induce a translation lexicon from monolingual corpora using techniques of unsupervised learning. For this, we propose a pipeline of several sub-steps that rely on different similarity measures: Language-independent formal similarity of words according to the BI-SIM measure (Kondrak & Dorr 2004) Language-dependent formal similarity of words, measured with a character-level machine translation system (Tiedemann 2009) Frequential similarity (Koehn & Knight 2002) Contextual similarity (Rapp 1999) In the second step, we assign to each word of the non-resourced language, the POS tag(s) observed with the resourced language word to which it has been linked in the first step. The resulting POS tag assignments can then be used to train a regular tagger. In the presentation, we will describe the different steps of our approach in some detail. We will also present the experiments that we have conducted with Romance, Germanic and Slavic language pairs, and for which we have obtained accuracy figures ranging between 59 % and 91 %.

40|$|This study {{offers a}} new {{approach}} to grammatical constructions that express futurity in Danish, Dutch, English, German, and Swedish. Future constructions develop out of lexical elements whose meanings persist to some degree in modern usage. Future constructions thus convey not only future time reference, but also modal meanings of volition, obligation, or possibility. This multifunctionality has been a challenge for previous accounts that aimed to delimit their function to either tense or modality. The present study aims to overcome this debate and views future constructions as meaningful units of language, not as mere paradigmatic alternatives to temporal or modal categories. The present study develops a methodology that provides the study of meaning with a strong empirical basis in the form of large computerized text collections. In order to characterize the meaning of a given future construction, the present analysis investigates the types of main verbs that typically co-occur with it in actual usage: If a given construction typically occurs with intentional verbs such as write or speak, its meaning will differ from constructions that typically occur with verbs such as rain or increase. The same methodology is applied to the historical study of future constructions: If a given construction tends to co-occur with different main verbs at subsequent stages in time, this is indicative of a semantic change. The results of both the synchronic and the historical investigation challenge results of earlier studies. For instance, the English future construction with be going to has been commonly assumed to be a <b>translational</b> <b>equivalent</b> of Dutch gaan. Evidence from modern usage data shows {{that this is not the}} case, since both constructions are used to refer to different types of future events. With respect to the historical development of future constructions, several developmental paths have been proposed for constructions deriving from verbs of motion, obligation, and other lexical sources. For example, verbs of motion are supposed to become markers of intention before they acquire temporal meaning. This study presents historical data from a Swedish future construction with the verb komma 'come', which has developed in an entirely different way. Overall, the comparison of future constructions across languages and across different periods of time is intended to develop an understanding of these constructions as meaningful units. While many aspects of these constructions are idiosyncratic, and thus account for the controversies that have surrounded them, some aspects are invariant across the investigated languages, and thus seem to be typical of future constructions in general. The study also yields new insights into the workings of grammatical change, especially regarding the function of co-occurring lexical material in the historical development of constructions. Methodologically, the present study breaks new ground as it empirically tests general tenets and specific proposals regarding grammatical change on the basis of primary usage data...|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tends to exploit corpus resources {{as a way}} of overcoming the problem of knowledge acquisition. Statistical analysis of corpora can reveal trends and probabilities of occurrence, which have proved to be helpful in various ways. Machine Translation (MT) is no exception to this trend. Many MT researchers have attempted to extract knowledge from parallel bilingual corpora. The MT problem is generally decomposed into two sub-problems: lexical selection and reordering of the selected words. This research addresses the problem of lexical selection of open-class lexical items in the framework of MT. The work reported in this thesis investigates different methodologies to handle this problem, using a corpus-based approach. The current framework can be applied to any language pair, but we focus on Arabic and English. This is because Arabic words are hugely ambiguous and thus pose a challenge for the current task of lexical selection. We use a challenging Arabic-English parallel corpus, containing many long passages with no punctuation marks to denote sentence boundaries. This points to the robustness of the adopted approach. In our attempt to extract lexical equivalents from the parallel corpus we focus on the co-occurrence relations between words. The current framework adopts a lexicon-free approach towards the selection of lexical equivalents. This has the double advantage of investigating the effectiveness of different techniques without being distracted by the properties of the lexicon {{and at the same time}} saving much time and effort, since constructing a lexicon is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Thus, we use as little, if any, hand-coded information as possible. The accuracy score could be improved by adding hand-coded information. The point of the work reported here is to see how well one can do without any such manual intervention. With this goal in mind, we carry out a number of preprocessing steps in our framework. First, we build a lexicon-free Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger for Arabic. This POS tagger uses a combination of rule-based, transformation-based learning (TBL) and probabilistic techniques. Similarly, we use a lexicon-free POS tagger for English. We use the two POS taggers to tag the bi-texts. Second, we develop lexicon-free shallow parsers for Arabic and English. The two parsers are then used to label the parallel corpus with dependency relations (DRs) for some critical constructions. Third, we develop stemmers for Arabic and English, adopting the same knowledge -free approach. These preprocessing steps pave the way for the main system (or proposer) whose task is to extract translational equivalents from the parallel corpus. The framework starts with automatically extracting a bilingual lexicon using unsupervised statistical techniques which exploit the notion of co-occurrence patterns in the parallel corpus. We then choose the target word that has the highest frequency of occurrence from among a number of translational candidates in the extracted lexicon in order to aid the selection of the contextually correct <b>translational</b> <b>equivalent.</b> These experiments are carried out on either raw or POS-tagged texts. Having labelled the bi-texts with DRs, we use them to extract a number of translation seeds to start a number of bootstrapping techniques to improve the proposer. These seeds are used as anchor points to resegment the parallel corpus and start the selection process once again. The final F-score for the selection process is 0. 701. We have also written an algorithm for detecting ambiguous words in a translation lexicon and obtained a precision score of 0. 89.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} a remarkable boom {{in the number of}} phraseological studies that examine learners’ use of lexical bundles, i. e. “recurrent expressions, regardless of their idiomaticity, and regardless of their structural status” (Biber et al. 1999 : 990). Some of the studies have put specific patterns of misuse, overuse and underuse of lexical bundles down to the learners’ mother tongue (see Paquot & Granger, 2012 for a review). Allen (2011 : 111), for example, partly ascribed Japanese students’ infelicitous use of the singular noun result in bundles such as result of this experiment (e. g. in the Japanese learner’s sentence: The result of this experiment was expressed by following graphs.) {{to the fact that the}} corresponding form in Japanese can denote both single and multiple findings and similarly attributed Japanese learners’ overuse of it can be said that to the L 1, as its <b>translational</b> <b>equivalent</b> is repeatedly used in Japanese academic writing. Rica (2010) adopted a lexical bundle approach to the study of linking adverbials in EFL learner writing and noted that a large proportion of the multi-word connectors that non-native writers overused were very similar to those word sequences which learners use in their L 1 to express similar meanings (e. g. English and Spanish I think ~ Creo que and for example ~ por ejemplo). However, no study has targeted transfer effects on EFL learners’ production of recurrent word sequences as their primary object of investigation. One of the main objectives of the author’s current research is to fill in this existing gap by conducting careful transfer studies of recurrent word combinations in EFL learner writing (Paquot, in press; Paquot, 2013). The present work deals with lexical bundles of various lengths (from 2 to 5 words) and focuses more particularly on: 1. Correct and incorrect multi-word sequences that fulfil organizational or rhetorical functions, e. g. contrasting (on the contrary), exemplifying (let us take the example), concluding (in conclusion, we can say), 2. Preferred co-occurrences that exemplify collocations (e. g. deeply rooted) colligations (e. g. considered as) and syntactic structures (e. g. role to play). The study makes use of Jarvis’s (2000) methodological framework to test transfer effects on recurrent word sequences in the French component of the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) (Granger et al. 2009) as compared to nine other ICLE learner sub-corpora. Intra-L 1 -group homogeneity (Effect 1) is most evident when directly compared with inter-L 1 -group heterogeneity (Effect 2) (Jarvis 2000), and I, therefore, rely on comparison of means tests and post hoc tests to examine Effects 1 and 2. While the first two effects readily lend themselves to automatic and quantitative evaluation, intra-L 1 -group congruity between French learners’ L 1 and IL performance does not. Assessing this third effect requires a more qualitative approach. First, the use of each lexical bundle was carefully analysed in ICLE-FR. The next steps consisted in identifying the French potential ‘equivalent’ of each lexical bundle in context, describing its use in French L 1 corpora and comparing learners’ L 1 and IL patterns of use. Applying Jarvis’s (2000) unified framework on learner corpus data brings to light interesting findings relating to L 1 influence on word use. It helps to identify a number of transfer effects that remain largely undocumented in the SLA literature: transfer of function, transfer of the phraseological environment, transfer of style and register, and transfer of L 1 frequency. These transfer effects make up what, following Hoey (2005), I refer to as transfer of ‘lexical priming’. EFL learners’ knowledge of words and word combinations in their mother tongue includes a whole range of information about their preferred co-occurrences and sentence position, stylistic or register features, discourse functions and frequency. Primings for collocational and contextual use of (at least a restricted set of frequent or core) L 1 lexical devices are particularly strong in the mental lexicon of adult EFL learners. They are the result of many encounters with these lexical items in L 1 speech and writing. Mental primings in the L 1 lexicon probably influence EFL learners’ knowledge of English words and word sequences by priming the lexico-grammatical preferences of an L 1 lexical item to its English counterpart. These results support Kellerman’s claim that the ‘hoary old chestnut’ according to which transfer does not afflict the more advanced learner “should finally be squashed underfoot as an unwarranted overgeneralization based on very limited evidence” (Kellerman, 1984 : 121). However, they also suggest that the main effect of the first language on higher-intermediate to advanced EFL learners’ use of recurrent word combinations is not errors (compare with transfer effects on learners’ use of collocations as reported in Nesselhauf, 2005 and Laufer & Waldman, 2011). Rather, findings provide more subtle evidence of L 1 influence in the form of patterns of overuse and underuse (see also Neff van Aertselaer, 2008; Paquot, 2010). References Allen, D. (2011).

Research on vocabulary development have generally provided strong support for this theory. Monolingual children in early language development learn one term for each concept, so does a bilingual child, just that the bilingual child does so for both L1 and L2, and hence they know two language terms of the same concept that has similar meaning, which {{is also known as}} <b>translational</b> <b>equivalents.</b> The awareness of synonyms do not appear till a much later age. For example, they know that both 'two' in English and 'dos' in Spanish refer to the numerical number '2'.|$|R

To find a functional equivalent that is adequate to the translation of agiven context, the search should focus on pragmatic correspondences rather thansemantic equivalents. The present article examines this phenomenon on the basisof the Russian near-synonymous discursive units with focus-sensitive semanticsimenno (just/precisely) and kak raz (just/precisely). They are important elements ofcommunication but have far not been fully described. Using relevant lexicographicinformation, text corpora, including parallel corpora, and works of fiction, we aregoing to show that synonymy of these discursive units is not as complete as itappears at first glance.

Its objective is to show how some characteristic elements of the co-text of supposedly true friends in English and Italian form different phraseological patterns which account for (un) suspected semantic and pragmatic divergences in their use. Some pairs of true friends, which are supposed to share the same meaning and use in the two languages, have been analysed in two broadly comparable corpora. Findings shed {{new light on the}} web of linguistic, cultural and pragmatic relations occurring beneath the lexical level: they ultimately explain why the cognate words analysed often turn out not to be <b>translational</b> <b>equivalents</b> of each other. The same corpus-based approach could prove helpful in analysing similar phenomena in other pairs of languages...|$|R
