Only one gubernatorial nominee in recent history has been rejected; Lynn Buhl, nominated as Maryland Secretary of the Environment by Governor Robert Ehrlich, was rejected over concerns about her qualifications. The Senate also has sole responsibility for trying any persons that have been impeached by the House of Delegates.

25|$|The Constitution {{stipulates}} that no constitutional amendment may be created to deprive {{a state of}} its equal suffrage in the Senate without that state's consent. The District of Columbia and all other territories are not entitled to representation in either House of the Congress. The District of Columbia elects two shadow senators, but they are officials of the D.C. city government and not members of the U.S. Senate.

The officer in question was sworn in, but the Senate, under the guise of a motion to reconsider, rescinded the advice and consent.
