5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it were}} not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{he became}} the first driver to heat his rear tires with a burnout and he was the first driver to use smaller front <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> a dragster in 1958. Hill {{introduced}} the aerodynamic front wing to dragsters and charcoal masks for driver safety.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{began its}} take-off from Los Angeles International Airport at approximately 9:25am. During that take-off roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 <b>tire</b> <b>on</b> the left {{main landing gear}} separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 <b>tire</b> <b>on</b> the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 <b>tire</b> <b>on</b> the left main gear, causing it to also blow out.|$|R

25|$|In 1994, Gordon won the Busch Clash {{exhibition}} race at Daytona.

25|$|Trucks with dual <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> {{the rear}} axle and two driven axles are {{designated}} as 4×4s despite having six wheels because the paired rear wheels behave {{as a single}} wheel for traction and classification purposes. True 6×6 vehicles which have three powered axles, and are classified as 6×6s regardless of how many wheels they have. Examples of these with two rear, one front axle are the 6-wheeled Pinzgauer, which is popular with defense forces around the globe, and 10-wheeled GMC CCKW made famous by the U.S. Army in World War II.|$|E

25|$|Green flag pit stops {{began on}} lap 113 when Gordon over tire wear concerns, {{and his crew}} changed <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> lap 113, {{with the rest of}} the field on lap 119. David Stremme blew a tire on pit road as soon as his {{teammates}} Reed Sorenson and Elliott Sadler exited. Sadler wound up in 2nd and Sorenson in 3rd while the entire field had to pit one lap later. Earnhardt, Jr. mistakingly made his second pit stop in Lap 121 by completing his pit stop with his right front tire over the outside boundary line of his pit box, resulting in a one lap penalty.|$|E

However, after missing a bed check and a practice during training camp, he underwent three weeks of additional rehabilitation, and returned {{for the start of the}} 1983 season. Before the second game of 1984 against the Seattle Seahawks, Muncie missed the team's charter flight from San Diego. When he arrived in Seattle, he told coach Don Coryell that vandals slashed the <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> his car. Coryell didn't believe him, and sent him back to San Diego.|$|E

25|$|In its Corps of Engineers Civil Works mission, CRREL {{researchers}} developed {{innovative ways}} to avoid ice jams and databases to address the widespread occurrence of such problems. A substantial ice engineering facility was built to support modeling of these problems. A remote-sensing and GIS (geographic information system) facility and organization were established to better employ the resources of satellite imagery and mapping of information to address problems worldwide. Another major facility, the Frost Effects Research Facility, was built to study problems associated with airfields and roadways, subject to freeze-thaw. An automated loading machine was acquired to simulate the passage of vehicle and aircraft <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> pavements. In building technology, researchers helped develop statistical means to identify snow and icing loads throughout the United States and standards for measuring heat loss, roof moisture detection, and frost-protected shallow foundations.|$|E
25|$|He had a {{far more}} {{successful}} Nationwide Series season than Sprint Cup Series season, including a win at the NAPA 200 at Montreal. In the race Edwards had a top-ten position until a final green-white-checker finish put him in third spot on the restart. Edwards passed Andrew Ranger for second and recovered from spinning his <b>tires</b> <b>on</b> the restart {{to catch up with}} dominant leader Marcos Ambrose. Edwards was unable to pass the Australian champion until the final turn of the final lap when Ambrose jumped over the curb too high. Edwards passed him and won the race in a big shock to the racing world; a finish considered {{to be one of the}} greatest of the sport. Edwards was elated about getting his first road course win at one of the most famous tracks in the world; has said that the Montreal race is his favorite winning performance, and that Marcos had chatted with him that week and taught him about the track during meetings which he credited for his success.|$|E
25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old <b>tires.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E
