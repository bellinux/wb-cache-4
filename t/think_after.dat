5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I <b>think</b> <b>after</b> a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
25|$|He had {{a horror}} of physicians, who were chiefly Greeks. He {{procured}} {{the release of}} Polybius, the historian, and his fellow prisoners, contemptuously asking whether the Senate had nothing more important to do than discuss whether a few Greeks should die at Rome or in their own land. It was not till his eightieth year that {{he made his first}} acquaintance with Greek literature, though some <b>think</b> <b>after</b> examining his writings that he may have had a knowledge of Greek works for much of his life.|$|E

Carol Park's niece has accused Gordon Park's family of 'clutching at straws' and has argued: [...] "Gordon went to the High Court of Appeal and lost, so what makes them <b>think</b> <b>after</b> all this time they could find any information that could overturn the court’s decision?" ...|$|E

In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I <b>think</b> <b>after</b> everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the {{follow-up}} to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>after</b> Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} a good {{perspective on the}} episode, considering it {{to have been the}} best episode of the season. Deeming the episode an [...] "eye-opening experience", West described Ellis' surprising personality as having worse repercussions on her daughter than the control issues and the intense disapproval that had previously been noted on the character: [...] "You would <b>think</b> <b>after</b> Ellis had a few hours to digest the news that she has essentially lost her mind, she would take advantage of the gift that is her brief lucidity to patch things up with Meredith. Meredith was hesitant to sit and talk with her mother about the last five years but finally she decides this could be her only chance." [...] Comparing Ellis' previous appearances in the series with the version presented in the episode, West stated she is [...] "far worse" [...] as a lucid person, noting how frustration and confusion are her main characteristics.|$|E

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. Despite calling the episode [...] "different", the two wrote that the story {{involving}} Mulder was [...] "not very satisfying". In addition, the two called the finale [...] "problematic" [...] because it featured Skinner and Doggett suppressing the truth, a thematic choice that goes against {{the spirit of the}} series. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris criticized Doggett's role, noting that [...] "you would <b>think</b> <b>after</b> this even he would become a raging believer, but no, he's not changed one bit." [...] Marisa Guthrie of the Boston Herald derided the fact that Duchovny was given such little amounts of screen time. Furthermore, she was critical that Doggett remained a skeptic {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd <b>think</b> <b>after</b> 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> two years of thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I {{think he wanted to}} know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E

[...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and my aunt lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah I saw myself as a Zionist and I <b>think</b> <b>after</b> I went there I felt it less.

2500|$|By way of {{example of}} how to clarify conceptions, he {{addressed}} conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the [...] "nominal" [...] grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real {{as the object of}} such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers <b>think.</b> <b>After</b> that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Erica becomes {{involved}} with the politician Travis Montgomery (Larkin Malloy). Erica and Travis are portrayed as sexually equal and infused with elements of romance and fantasy. Erica becomes pregnant with his child, but does not tell him for fear that it will disrupt his political career. In 1988, when Travis finds out about the baby, they get married. She becomes attracted to his brother, Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey), but does not act on the feeling until after she and Travis divorce. They have [...] "a very hot romance" [...] and fall in love, but Erica remarries Travis in 1990 at their daughter Bianca's insistence. Travis and Erica's second marriage is not a happy one. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>after</b> they got back together," [...] said Lucci, [...] "it {{was never the same}} again. There was always this rift. He became bitter and sort of cruel to Erica." [...] Their second marriage ends after Travis catches her cheating on him with Jack. During the custody hearing over Bianca, Jack refuses to lie about their affair, resulting in Erica losing custody of her daughter.|$|E

In the following January he was equally successful and, to fulfill his obligations to write music for Catania—a condition of his scholarship—he sent a Messa di gloria which was performed the following October. His involvement in Zingarelli's class took place over the 1822/23 school year. By January 1824, after passing examinations where he did very well, resulted in his being given the title of primo maestrino, a post which required him to tutor younger students, allowed him to have a room of his own in the Collegio, and also allowed him visits to the opera on Thursdays and Sundays, where he saw his first opera by Rossini, Semiramide. While Weinstock gives an account of how he was [...] "clearly captivated by the music of Rossini... he put Rossini on a pedestal", he relates that, returning from the performance Bellini was unusually quiet and then [...] "suddenly exclaimed to his companions, 'Do you know what I <b>think?</b> <b>After</b> Semiramide, it's futile for us to try and achieve anything' [...] " ...|$|E
