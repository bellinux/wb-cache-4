40|$|Abstract: Telecommunication {{means in}} South Africa are not equally {{accessible}} to all. There are still disparities {{in terms of}} access to electronic telecommunication by people {{in the rural areas}} compared to those who live in urban areas. This situation has created a huge information gap between the rural and urban dwellers. As part of trying to bridge this information gap, the South African government has vigorously promoted the installation of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>centres</b> (telecentres, as they are known) in rural parts of the country. However, most of these telecentres are not achieving the envisaged aims and objectives. This research undertakes an evaluation of a telecentre in Tombo village of Port St. Johns in the Eastern Cape Province with the aim of establishing some of the success factors for the sustainability of a telecentre. Semi-structured interviews and observations were used to gather data and a qualitative analysis of the data elucidated some of the challenges in sustaining the telecentre as a viable operation. The recommendations include: That an entrepreneurial or innovative approach must be used in order to make telecentres sustainable; vigorous means of awareness and training about the telecentre services are needed; and, the need for serious consideration of all relevant categories of stakeholders coupled with addressing socio-economic and political issues within the community must not be overlooked...|$|R

40|$|To which {{extent the}} scale of the {{informal}} settlements could effectively co-exist with the necessity of an affordable mass-housing provision through a top-down intervention?" The solution proposed will try to integrate the potentialities that these two approaches embrace, during the different steps of the design process, from the urban analysis until the final architecture result. The area that will be investigated for the design proposal is the Dejach Wube Sefer: Its position is remarkable for the proximity to the main institutional and commercial areas of the capital city (town hall, St. George cathedral, commercial center) : for this reason in the last decade it became a strategic place for companies offices (<b>telecommunication</b> <b>centre),</b> headquarters of governmental institutions (police station and academy) and services (hotel, offices, banks) especially all along the western street to the Entoto Mountains. The eastern street is also gradually gaining importance, due to several main reasons, among them the main ones are: new tertiary activities are being built on its opposite side and the higher Importance of the university campus place northerly. One of the main characteristics that make the Sefer unique is its heterogeneity of functions and people: the formality of the new constructions co-exists with the tradition of the Old Villas and the old Ras Palace as well as with informal clusters scattered all around. The design decisions consequently will have to face these conditions of people heterogeneity, with different needs and spaces demands. Moreover the final project should include new commercial opportunities in order to improve and strength the site potentialities. Such commercial opportunities, especially {{in this part of the}} Sefer, seemed to be Impeded by the massive retain wall running all along its corner (built because of the enlargement of the East-West street).

40|$|The Olivetti {{factory in}} Pozzuoli (Naples, Italy) was {{designed}} in 1951 by Luigi Cosenza (1905 - 1984) on commission by Adriano Olivetti (1901 - 1960). It represents an outstanding case study, since {{it deals with}} a typically modern architectural theme, and develops it in an original way, raising {{a number of issues}} addressed by the conference. The industrialization of a geographic and socio-cultural context – that inherits a rich historical tradition, dating back to the Greek foundation of a site of great landscape value – is confronted with the modern aspirations to right to work, health, and human dignity. The Olivetti factory illustrates a research that was developed within the frame of philosophical conceptions and political implications, related to the above mentioned issues. It affirms the ideology of a project that aims to combine work and social spaces, and it also carries out buildings of great significance {{from the point of view}} of landscape and urban layout, as well as form and language. While industrialization has often been wounding landscape, this factory has actually re-founded the territory and has added historical and cultural values to the geographical one. With regard to its architecture, this factory does not adhere to that twentieth-century aesthetic trend, which would emphasize the severe, though appealing look of the industrial construction. The buildings in Pozzuoli do not look like a factory, but reveal rather the distinctive feature of Cosenza's rationalism that draws on the international architectural debate as cultivates its own cultural heritage. Slender columns, supporting projecting horizontal slabs hanging at different heights, usher you into the factory. Once through the porch, nothing is reminiscent of the warehouse building type, you are rather in front of an articulate urban-scale layout that dialogues with the site on which it rises. The buildings are placed according to a cross-shaped layout, and are characterized by a structural span, which is repeated throughout the complex. The diaphanous boundary between inside and outside is free from structural constraints, because the pillars are shifted away from the building outline. The architecture dialogues with the orography, casting glances at the landscape, and is also embroidered with lights and shadows, drawn by brise-soleils and projecting shelters, as well as enriched by the colourful palette of Marcello Nizzoli (1887 - 1969). The greenery designed by Pietro Porcinai (1910 - 1986) is not a mere natural background, on which the architecture stands out, but is rather a part of the composition. The urban plan had been conceived as a foundation layout for future extensions that were actually carried out during the first half of the 1960 s on a project by Cosenza himself, and later on at the end of that decade. The factory – that does not produce typewriters any longer, but houses several educational, research and <b>telecommunication</b> <b>centres</b> – has expanded without altering the balance achieved by the architect among nature, architecture, living spaces and places of work. Criteria for the safeguard of the Olivetti factory's social meaning, as well as its spaces and elements, derive from its analysis and evolution through time...|$|R

An essential factor of the call centre optimization is the determination of the proper number of operators considering the selected performance measure. Results of previous research show that this can be done using the queueing theory approach. Objectives: The paper presents the practical application of the stochastic queueing models aimed at optimizing a Slovenian <b>telecommunication</b> provider’s call <b>centre.</b> Methods/Approach: The arrival and the service patterns were analysed, and it was concluded that the call centre under consideration can be described using the M/M/r {infinity/infinity/FIFO} queueing model. Results: An appropriate number of operators were determined for different peak periods of the working day, taking into consideration the following four performance measures: the expected waiting time, the expected number of waiting customers, the probability that a calling customer will have to wait, and the call centre service level. Conclusions: The obtained results prove the usefulness and applicability of the queueing models as a tool for a call centre performance optimization. In practice, all the data needed for such a mathematical analysis are usually provided. This paper is aimed at illustrating how such data can be efficiently exploited...|$|R
40|$|Background: Call centres are {{thriving}} and expanding commercial enterprises providing cost-effective ways for organisations {{to connect with}} new and existing clients through <b>telecommunication</b> channels. Call <b>centre</b> agents perform this function telephonically for 75 % {{of the day in}} large open-plan office environments characterised by workloads that are demanding, repetitive and highly scripted. Verbal abuse by clients is prevalent adding to a work experience that is potentially emotionally draining and stressful. Agents are under constant surveillance and monitoring to abide with commercial regulations but also to ensure high call volume and quality engagement with clients, these being the most important performance indicators. High staff absenteeism and attrition levels account for large financial losses in the industry. To date no studies have been found considering the impact of sensory processing of call centre agents on their performance, absenteeism and attrition. Sensory processing considers the neuro-physiological and behavioural components of individuals in the interactions with their daily work occupations and life environments. Although predominantly applied in paediatric clinical populations in occupational therapy, sensory processing provides universal truths about human behaviour which can add value to promoting wellness amongst healthy adults in work environments. Design: A quantitative, non-experimental and correlational study design was used to measure and compare demographic, sensory processing and performance data from 459 call centre staff within four fully operational call centres, which varied in type of operation, employer and geographical area in South Africa. The standardised and validated 60 -item Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (Brown, Tollefson, Dunn, Cromwell & Fillion, 2001) was used to measure sensory processing as neurological thresholds and potential propensity for individuals to cope with high sensory stimulating work environments. Agent performance data {{in each of the four}} centres were recorded daily, in real time, using sophisticated information technology systems, and included details about absenteeism. Attrition data were collected after the initial data intake to reflect true attrition. Results: Data were analysed using statistical methods to obtain locality (e. g. means, medians), dispersion (e. g. standard deviations and interquartile ranges) and associations (e. g. Spearman Rank correlations). Results showed strong, consistent and significant correlations between agents who displayed sensation avoiding processing and poor performance. Agents who exhibited sensation seeking processing had higher performance ratings. To a lesser, yet still significant, degree agents with low registration and sensory sensitivity also had lower performance ratings. Sensory sensitive agents were absent less often than other workers and sensation seeking agents showed a tendency for higher attrition. Results differed between service inbound call centres to sales and collections outbound ones. Team leaders, who are high performing agents promoted into these positions, had less sensory sensitive and sensation avoiding processing styles. A novel subset structure was designed to account for the multidimensional capacity of the AASP, and this was correlated with all the performance data. It provided a preliminary method for use in further research studies. The study strengths were the innovative sample in measuring sensory processing of healthy populations at work and the compilation of performance data through sophisticated computerised systems, which minimised the margin of error. Study limitations were the use of a self-questionnaire format for profile data collection and small sample sizes in subsequent data collection stages. Recommendations: The AASP has the potential to be used by call centre human resource practitioners for recruitment and performance management. Improved sensory environmental considerations and adaptations supportive of a more successful and healthier agent-job-environment fit are provided. The study findings support knowledge transfer into other general human resource management, education and training, occupational health management and occupational therapy practises. It expands the application of sensory processing theories and informs future research...|$|R
