40|$|Reconstructions of the British–Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) {{during the}} Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> and {{southern}} Ireland have been hampered by {{a paucity of}} well-dated stratigraphic records. As a result, {{the timing of the}} last advance of the largest outlet of the BIIS, the Irish Sea Ice Stream, to its maximum limit in <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> has been variously proposed as being pre-last glaciation, Early Devensian and LGM. The Irish Sea Till was deposited by the Irish Sea Ice Stream during its last advance into <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea.</b> We present 26, stratigraphically well constrained, new AMS radiocarbon dates on glacially transported marine shells from the Irish Sea Till in southern Ireland, which constrain the maximum age of this advance. The youngest of these dates indicate that the BIIS advanced to its overall maximum limit in <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> after 26, 000 – 20, 000 14 C yr BP, thus during the last glaciation. The most extensive phase of BIIS growth therefore appears to have occurred during the LGM, at least along <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> and Irish margins. These data further demonstrate that the uppermost inland glacial tills, from the area of supposed “older drift” in southern Ireland, a region previously regarded as having been unglaciated during the LGM also date from the last glaciation. Thus most of southern Ireland was ice covered at the LGM. Advance of the BIIS to its maximum southern limit in <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> may have been a short-lived glaciodynamic response facilitated by subglacial bed conditions, rather than a steady-state response to climate forcing alone...|$|R

40|$|Current {{legislation}} {{requires the}} UK to achieve Good Environmental Status by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive {{and it is}} generally recognised that stakeholders will have {{a vital role in}} achieving this goal. The aim of this project is to determine how stakeholders, specifically the fishing industry, relate to <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> in the South West of England. This will be achieved through a questionnaire distributed to the stakeholders in the South West by the online Survey Monkey Tool and supplemented by face-to-face interviews with the fishing industry specifically. The results indicate the stakeholders in the South West use <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> for work and recreational purposes, or in some cases both. There is differing perceptions amongst the stakeholders regarding the boundary, management and condition of <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> which contributes to the varying levels of engagement encountered including their ability to influence decision- making. The working and recreation respondents identified conflict in <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas,</b> with the main contributing factors being space, resource and legislation but experience them at varying levels from none to a lot. The respondents suggested a number of mechanisms which could be used to prevent or minimise conflict in the future. Interestingly a common theme was the need for greater stakeholder involvement to achieve a better understanding, awareness, and appreciation of the marine environment and each other’s needs but there was acknowledgement that such efforts to date have not been very effective. Greater stakeholder involvement can have a number of benefits including better communication and increasing trust between the stakeholders, however further work is needed to better understand what can be done differently so that stakeholders feel they have a role and voice in the decision being made.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are a management tool used {{to respond to}} human-derived threats in marine ecosystems. Historically, MPAs have been established on an individual ad hoc basis, rather than through a systematic, planned process. However, high levels of functional and spatial connectivity within marine ecosystems {{have led to the}} suggestion that networks of MPAs provide greater ecological benefits than individual MPAs. Consequently, international policy has developed to consider broader spatial requirements for marine conservation, resulting in a number of international and regional agreements that require the establishment of ecologically coherent MPA networks. Existing MPAs are now being considered, retrospectively, alongside new designations, as networks of MPAs across regions, both nationally and internationally. Under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), France, the Republic of Ireland, and the UK (including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man) are required to work together to ensure coordinated development of marine strategies for <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> subregion. Accordingly, MPAs have been identified as crucial components of the programme of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) under the MSFD. Here, we provide the first ecological coherence assessment of an MPA network spanning an MSFD subregion. A network of 533 MPAs, or parts thereof, across <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> subregion was assessed using five criteria and two methodologies, with a focus on broadscale habitats. While <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> MPA network as a whole is not ecologically coherent (according to accepted thresholds), progress toward a number of global targets has been achieved, for example, protection of 10 % of marine and coastal areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Further, all MSFD predominant habitat types assessed are adequately represented and replicated within the network. However, a number of gaps were identified, including a lack of MPAs in offshore and deeper areas, and inadequate proportions of predominant habitat types within MPAs. Addressing these gaps to enable the MPA network to fulfill its critical role in the delivery of GES under the MSFD will require both national progress toward designation of adequate and viable MPAs and transboundary agreements and coordination of MPA designation processes at the European level...|$|E

40|$|The rate {{at which}} water masses are {{transformed}} from one density class to another is assessed in the shelf seas using the Walin (1982) framework. For a tidal-mixing front, the transformation is estimated using air-sea density fluxes and the diapycnal mixing diagnosed {{from a series of}} one-dimensional mixed layer models running across the shelf. These transformation rates diagnosed from the air-sea fluxes and diapycnal mixing agree with volume changes dagnosed directly from the model. The transformation from air-sea fluxes reaches a maximum amplitude typically twice that provided by diffusive mixing. This framework is extended to estimate the {{rate at which}} nutrients are converted in nutrient space including the effects of biological consumption. The transformation in density and nutrient space are broadly related in the spring when there is a relatively tight relationship between density and nutrient concentrations. For a shelf-break front in <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas,</b> the transformation is estimated from a combination of observed air-sea fluxes, remotely-sensed sea surface temperature and ship-based measurements of density and turbulent mixing.

40|$|Hydrographic, plankton, benthos, {{fisheries}} landings, {{and fish}} diet data from shelf sea {{areas in the}} Northeast Atlantic have been combined into {{an analysis of the}} foodweb structure and secondary production requirements of regional fisheries. Fish landings from the Baltic and North Sea are shown to be taken from a lower trophic level and are shown to be overall more planktivorous than those from shelf edge regions. The secondary production required per unit of landed fish from the North Sea was approximately half that for landings from the southwest approaches to the UK, referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas,</b> where zooplankton production accounted for {{only a small fraction of}} the secondary production demands of the fisheries. In the North Sea, variability in zooplankton production seems to have exerted a bottom-up effect on fish production, which in turn has exerted a top-down effect on the benthos. Conversely, Celtic Seas benthos production has been a bottom-up driver of fish production, which seems to have been independent of variability in plankton production. Thus, climate and fishing pressures can be expected to influence these regional fisheries in very different ways. Overall, the results indicate very strong spatial patterns in the fish foodweb structure and function, which will be important considerations in the establishment of regional management plans for fisheries...|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether it is possible to predict substrate composition across a large area of seabed using legacy grain-size data and environmental predictors. The study area includes the North Sea up to approximately 58. 44 °N and the United Kingdom’s parts of the English Channel and <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas.</b> The analysis combines outputs from hydrodynamic models as well as optical remote sensing data from satellite platforms and bathymetric variables, which are mainly derived from acoustic remote sensing.

The compositional data is analysed on the additive log-ratio scale. An independent test set indicates that approximately 66 % and 71 % of the variability of the two log-ratio variables are explained by the predictive models. A EUNIS substrate model, derived from the predicted sediment composition, achieved an overall accuracy of 83 % and a kappa coefficient of 0. 60. We demonstrate that it is feasible to spatially predict the seabed sediment composition across a large area of continental shelf in a repeatable and validated way.

40|$|The Irish Sea {{ice stream}} {{was the largest}} ice stream to drain the last British ice sheet, and around the margins of <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea</b> it {{deposited}} a shelly diamict facies that has been variously interpreted as subglacial till or distal glacial marine mud. We present new observations on the sedimentology of the shelly diamict and overlying sediments from the south coast of Ireland, and demonstrate that the shelly diamict facies is a subglacial deformation till deposited during onshore movement of a grounded Irish Sea ice stream. Stratigraphic and chronological data indicate that this occurred during the last glaciation, and this is regionally consistent with marine geological evidence from <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea.</b> We propose that the deforming bed tills along the south coast of Ireland are the onshore record of a rapid advance of an unstable Irish Sea ice stream into <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Sea.</b> This advance was facilitated, at least in part, by a saturated substrate of readily deformable, fine-grained, marine sediment.

40|$|The {{presence}} of tropical species {{has been reported}} in Atlantic-European waters with increasing frequency in recent years. Unfortunately, the history of their migrations is not well understood. In this study, we examined the routes and timing of fish migrations in several ecosystems of the East Atlantic Ocean, combining several publicly available and unpublicized datasets on species occurrences. The species studied were those noted as exotic or rare outside their previous known area of distribution. We used sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained from 30 years of satellite observation to define three distinct time periods. Within these periods, temperature trends were studied in six ecosystems: the North Sea, the Celtic Sea, the South European Atlantic Waters, the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Current and the Guinea Current. We also incorporated bathymetry data to describe the distribution of species. Measurement across a relatively large spatial extent was made possible by incorporating the capabilities of GIS. While SST increased consistently over time in all of the ecosystems observed, the change in number of species differed among ecosystems. The number of species in the middle regions, such as the South European Atlantic Shelf and the Western Mediterranean Sea, tended to increase over time. These regions received numbers of species from the lower or the upper latitudes according to season. Of all of the species observed in the recent period, 7 species from the Canary Current tended {{to be found in the}} Western Mediterranean Sea, and 6 species from these two regions extended their distributions to the South European Atlantic Shelf. Twelve species from the Canary Current moved seasonally to the Guinea Current. In the northern regions, 13 species moved seasonally in the North Sea and <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas,</b> and 12 of these species reached the South European Atlantic Shelf. This study presents a picture of routes and timing of species migration at the biogeographical scale. It shows how species have shifted their area of distribution (mostly northward) along the Eastern Atlantic ecosystems or have increased their depth ranges probably to remain within their preferred temperature range in response to long-term and seasonal environmental changes...|$|E
40|$|Practitioners {{and policy}} makers at European Union (EU) and Member States level are {{increasingly}} seeking spatially-explicit ecosystem service information to use in decision-making and {{the implementation of the}} EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. Whilst under the MAES Action, land-cover data has already been used to map the distribution of several ecosystem services provided over the European land surface, a similar exercise exploiting existing seabed habitat data is still lacking for the European Seas. In this work we map the distribution of seabed-associated ecosystem services capacity by using a methodology that brings together (i) a geospatial dataset representing the broadscale distribution of permanently-submerged seabed habitats with (ii) information on each habitat capacity to provide ecosystem services. A compilation of EUNIS-harmonized broadscale seabed habitat maps based on EMODNET Seabed Habitats and UNEP GSGFM is exploited as the pan-European cartographic basis. The exercise extends out to the limits of the Extended Continental Shelf claims, achieving an areal coverage of approximately 8. 7 million km 2, i. e., more than 90 % of the EU seafloor area in the Northeast Atlantic and adjacent seas. Alongside, expert-based assessments of each marine EUNIS habitat's capacity to provide CICES-harmonized Ecosystem Services are compiled from a literature review into a presence-only lookup table. Overall, the new seabed habitats versus ecosystem services lookup tables relate 33 ecosystem services to 67 EUNIS and 24 non-EUNIS seabed habitats. These results suggest that out of all marine habitats (n= 974) in the EUNIS classification (EUNIS A 1 to A 7), only 14 % (n= 141) have so far been related to at least one ecosystem service. When all potential connections between the existing seabed EUNIS classes and CICES services are considered (n= 104, 218), results further show that only 2 % (i. e., n= 2, 241) of the have been addressed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively. Based on this information, a total of 30 CICES ecosystem service categories are mapped: 3 at level 1 (CICES Sections), 5 at level 2 (CICES Divisions), 10 at level 3 (CICES Groups) and 12 at level 4 (CICES Classes). From these maps, area-based indicators of ecosystem service capacity (i. e., extent where each service is potentially provided) are extracted per MSFD region/subregion, Ecoregion, Fishing Area and an approximation of EU Member States (MS) maritime areas in the Northeast Atlantic and Adjacent Seas. Along with the maps, the study presents also some spatial statistics based on the extent over which each service is potentially provided. Different segmentations of the European Seas are used to aggregate these statistics including MSFD region/subregion, Ecological Region, FAO Fishing Area and an approximation of the Member State maritime area. Overall, continental shelves and oceanic elevations (islands, seamounts and ridges) were highlighted as ecosystem services hotspots where a larger number of services could be potentially held. When maps were segmented using MSFD region/subregion limits, the Extended Continental Shelf areas claimed by the EU MS in the Northeast Atlantic, together with <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> <b>Seas</b> and the Greater North Sea sub-regions stood as the regions holding most ecosystem service capacity. An ecoregion-based segmentation of the maps emphasized the Atlantic Deep Sea as the major ecosystem service capacity holder, followed by ecoregions containing large shelves, notably the Boreal Proper, the Boreal-Lusitanean and the Western Mediterranean. A disaggregation of the results per Fishing Area highlighted the Northeast Atlantic, namely areas around the British Isles and Macaronesia, as well as the western Mediterranean. When an approximation of EU Member States (MS) maritime areas was used, MS with larger EEZs (namely, UK, IT, PT and ES) came up as holding most of the marine ecosystem service capacity. The new maps and associated area-based indicators provide a first spatially-explicit baseline concerning the EU-wide distribution of marine ecosystem services. They contribute to the marine component of MAES and fulfil key objectives of the JRC’s SEACOAST and BES projects. Options to develop this research line and eventually make it more quantitative are expounded in the discussion and summarized in the conclusions. The new information is of value to practitioners, managers {{and policy makers}}, at European or Member State level, seeking spatially-explicit ecosystem service information for marine spatial planning and environmental management.
