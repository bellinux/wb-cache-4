40|$|ABSTRACT Egg shell {{damage was}} {{evaluated}} {{in different parts}} of production and processing systems in various locations in the state of Indiana. Eggs were sampled and hand candled to determine damage at the cage or at the first access point in flat-deck systems, on the <b>transfer</b> <b>belt</b> for in-line systems; on flats if eggs were cased and shipped to the processing plant; ahead of the washer; after washing and candling; and in the carton. These locations were chosen because they represent potential damage sites. Damage ranged from a low of 0. 0 % at some locations to a high of 35 % at others. The percent of cracked eggs tended to increase the further the eggs traveled in the processing procedure. Point of lay damage was found to average 3. 5 %, which was also the same as damage in the carton. By using surveys such as this combined with employee training programs, steps can be taken to minimize breakage. POULTRY SCIENCE 55 : 758 - 761, 1976 CRACKED eggs cost money. U. S. pro-ducers and processors are losing millions of dollars per year to cracked or broken eggs. Damaged egg loss is frequently considered as part of the production cost. When held to a minimum this is acceptable; however, if damage begins to increase and the actual loss figure is never analyzed, the cost to the producer or processor may exceed what is considered as normal in cost of production or operation. Based on estimates of U. S. egg production, as reported by U. S. D. A., being approxi-mately 184 million cases in 1974, the annual loss to the industry could then be almost 2 million cases for each 1 % of broken eggs. With breakage frequently between 3 and 5 %, this loss figure is sizable. In times of slim margins a small producer may experience losses which mean the difference in a profit or loss. It was because these losses often go almost unnoticed or uncorrected that this survey was conducted. The objectives of the study were to evalu-ate the problem of cracked or broken eggs in laying houses and egg processing plants...|$|E

It is necessary to answer a set of questions both empirical (observed {{over the years in}} the area of health and safety) and theoretical (following an analysis of the international literature) relative to the dimension of the problem of musculoskeletal injuries resulting from the exercise of the nursing profession in a hospital context. Research questions addressed include: 1) Are there complaints associated to the performing of nursing tasks? 2) How serious in terms of absolute numbers are musculoskeletal injuries? 3) What sort of influence does the environment (namely buildings) play, as well as technology / equipment, and work organization? Furthermore, 4) What should be present in the workplace but is not? After analyzing survey (of 168 active nurses in Portuguese hospitals) and interview data and having observed nurses at work, accompanying them in their day-to-day tasks, there is a global tendency to consider that, over the last twelve months of work, in a hospital context, nursing professionals have felt pain or musculoskeletal discomfort in a part of their bodies. Research results point also to more training and more adequate working spaces being needed in order to decrease musculoskeletal injuries amongst nurses.

40|$|The {{development}} of extensional basins is commonly explained as {{induced by the}} kinematics of tectonic plates (lithospheric stretching and flexure, strike-slip-related basins) and by the density imbalances produced by oceanic ridges, continental margins and plateau uplifts. Strike-slip-related basins are commonly associated to transform plate boundaries, to obliquely-converging plate boundaries where deformation is fully partitioned into dip-slip and strike-slip faulting, and to intraplate strike-slip deformation <b>belts</b> <b>transferring</b> displacement from convergent plate boundaries to the plate interiors. The occurrence of strike-slip deformation belts that are significantly active in intraplate regions is possibly uncommon in divergent plate boundaries, that are generally believed {{to be dominated by}} sea floor spreading and passive margin development. Plate tectonics theory does not predict any strike-slip movement along fracture zones once they pass outboard of their associated ridge segments and away from the plate boundary. In this contribution we illustrate the Cenozoic geodynamic framework at the northeastern edge of the Antarctic plate, where we believe there is strong evidence for the occurrence of post-rift strike-slip deformation belts including both the intraridge (transform) and out-of-ridge segments of fracture zones, and their collinear onshore strike-slip fault systems. These impressively long strike-slip <b>belts</b> <b>transfer</b> differential spreading at the constructional plate boundary into the plate interior, where residual horizontal displacement is accommodated in a lithosphere-scale horsetail array of transtensional basins. Deep basins originated also along the main traces of these intraplate strike-slip belts, both in oceanic and continental crust. Basin opening to accommodate displacement associated to intraplate strike-slip deformation belts dissecting passive margins provides an additional geodynamic scenario for explaining the occurrence of important extensional deformations in the plate interiors...|$|R

These mines use {{a wide variety}} of extraction methods, but they have many common dust sources and dust control needs. Ore passes, drills, blasting, conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>transfer</b> points, crushers, and load-haul-dump operations can be major sources of dust.

For the most part, dust in hard-rock mines is controlled with ventilation air, water sprays, and dust collectors. It is also important to prevent dust from getting into the air in the first place. Good dust control practices will reduce overall mine ventilation requirements. [Lack of maintenance is the main source of dust problems in hard-rock mines according to Rodgers [1974], who conducted a dust survey of hard-rock mines several decades ago.

40|$|Float {{coal dust}} is {{produced}} by various mining methods, carried by ventilating air and deposited on the floor, roof and ribs of mine airways. If deposited, float dust is re-entrained during a methane explosion. Without sufficient inert rock dust quantities, this float coal dust can propagate an explosion throughout mining entries. Consequently, controlling float coal dust is of critical interest to mining operations. Rock dusting, which is the adding of inert material to airway surfaces, is the main control technique currently used by the coal mining industry to reduce the float coal dust explosion hazard. To assist the industry in reducing this hazard, the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health initiated a project to investigate methods and technologies to reduce float coal dust in underground coal mines through prevention, capture and suppression prior to deposition. Field characterization studies were performed to determine quantitatively the sources, types and amounts of dust produced during various coal mining processes. The operations chosen for study were a continuous miner section, a longwall section and a coal-handling facility. For each of these operations, the primary dust sources were confirmed to be the continuous mining machine, longwall shearer and conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>transfer</b> points, respectively. Respirable and total airborne float dust samples were collected and analyzed for each operation, and the ratio of total airborne float coal dust to respirable dust was calculated.

In addition, the ion beam techniques would be available for rapid analysis of near-surface regions of other experiments, such as molecular-beam epitaxy. The instrumentation-semiconductor nuclear-particle detectors and multichannel analyzer for such measurements are simple and were used in early Surveyor lunar analyses. The accelerator is based on the tandem accelerator principle pumped by the vacuum of space. It consists of a series of eight light equispaced titanium concentric spheres which are supported on a single insulating hollow column. The largest sphere which is at the potential of the spacecraft has a diameter of 200 cm. The smallest sphere has a diameter of 30 cm and is maintained at l MV potential. Voltage is generated between the largest sphere and the smallest sphere by using an inductively charged stapled <b>belt</b> to physically <b>transfer</b> charge.

40|$|Master's thesis in Information technologyThis master thesis {{involves}} {{further development}} of the physical sorter system that {{was developed in the}} preliminary project (MIK 110). The system is built up by LEGO Technic parts and is controlled by MATLAB and LEGO Mind- storms NXT. The system basically consist of a conveyor belt, a sorter arm, a web camera and control system (MATLAB). The conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>transfers</b> desired objects {{from one end to the}} other and are controlled by a servo. The sorter arm can push a object off the conveyor belt and into a tray. The sorter arm is also controlled by a servo. Both servos are connected to the NXT Intelligent Brick (NXT). The web camera detect objects moving on the con- veyor belt. This web camera is connected to a computer running MATLAB. MATLAB runs the system (connected to NXT) and manages the handling of detected objects. To get MATLAB and LEGO Mindstorms NXT to in- teract, a toolbox called RWTH Toolbox is implemented. All computational task are handled in MATLAB. The web camera is controlled by a function called MOD. This function enables the web camera to capture one frame at a time. To detect movement from one frame to another a method called background subtraction (BS) is used. Since MOD is intended to only detect moving objects and not the movement of the conveyor belt, which creates a dynamic background, a method called background modeling (BM) is implemented. The BM method creates a model of the background and slowly updates the model when a new frame is captured. This method suppresses movement and illumination/reflection from the conveyor belt which can produce false positive detections. The frame containing the object of interest (OOI) is then pre processed by a function called ooi. This function is solely based on mathematical morphology and uses this to register, extract and represent the OOI. Representation includes both internal (area) and external (boundary/signature) character- istics, and these are used as features to describe the object. From a object, four different features are computed and they are the area, the mean and standard deviation computed from the signature and the amount of ver- tices/peaks in the signature. All features are gathered in a feature vector X and all features are normalized. There are two different objects that the system have to detect. These are two different types of LEGO Technic gears. Both have 24 teethes, but one gear is crowned and the other is normal. The features collected from these objects are very much a like. A classifier is implemented in the system to distinguish between these two objects and solve this 2 -class problem. A method called Cross validation was used in the experiments to find the best classifier. The cross validation was performed on a three different classifiers which were based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation, the Parzen Window technique and kn-nearest-neighbor (kNN) technique. The data set (consisting of gathered feature vectors from both objects) that each classifier was trained on, was 2 -, 3 - and 4 -dimensional for each experiment. Also, in each experiment, raw and normalized data was used. The classifier that was implemented in the system, based on the results from the cross validation, was the kNN classifier for normalized 4 -dimensional data. From the cross validation results, this classifier had a error rate of 6. 43 %, but this error rate is affected by illumination. Experiments showed that the error rate varies between 3 and 10 % when the classifier was imple- mented in the system and new feature data was gathered.
