50|$|There is {{a single}} record of {{hybridization}} with the <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> is 11.5 cm long, has a 19.69 cm wingspan, {{and weighs}} roughly 10 g. The {{breeding}} male has olive back, shoulders, rump and vent. The flight feathers are brownish-black. It has a slate gray neck, crown and eyeline. The underside is a gray-white. The female {{is similar to}} the male, but is much duller and has a greener tinge to the underside. The <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> has long wings, short tail and a thin, pointy bill. Juveniles and first-year birds are quite similar to the female.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> feeds {{mainly on}} insects and prefers the spruce budworm. This species fluctuates in {{population}} with {{the quantity of}} the budworm. It also likes flower nectar, fruit and some seeds.|$|E
50|$|Nashville warblers {{breed in}} two {{distinct}} areas, one in Canada and the northeastern United States, {{and another in}} the western United States. The northeastern part of its range extends from Côte-Nord and Cape Breton Island in eastern Canada to central Alberta. For the most part, it only breeds between about 52 and 45.5 degrees north, {{but it is also}} found less commonly in the Appalachians of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Although named after Nashville, <b>Tennessee,</b> the Nashville <b>warbler</b> only visits that area during migration. They migrate to southernmost Texas and California, mid-Mexico, and the northernmost parts of Central America (Guatemala and El Salvador) in winter. In their breeding range, they prefer open mixed woods and bog habitats.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> (Oreothlypis peregrina) is a New World warbler that breeds {{in eastern}} North America and winters in {{southern}} Central America and northern South America. The genus name Oreothlypis is from Ancient Greek oros, [...] "mountain", and thlupis, an unidentified small bird; thlypis {{is often used}} in the scientific names of New World warblers. The specific peregrina is from Latin [...] peregrinus [...] "wanderer".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> prefers {{coniferous}} forests, mixed conifer-deciduous forests, early successional woodlands and boreal bogs. It makes a cup-shaped nest {{of dried}} grasses and moss lined with finer grasses, stems and hair. The nest {{can be placed}} on the ground or above a bog in moss or in the base of a shrub. The nest is built by the female, and she lays 4-7 white eggs with brown splotches on them.|$|E

50|$|These {{birds are}} {{distinguished}} by {{their lack of}} wing bars, streaking on the underparts, strong face marking or bright colouring, resembling a fall <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> and a black-throated blue warbler, {{both of which are}} also members of the New World warbler family. The orange patch on the crown is usually not visible. They have olive-grey upperparts, yellowish underparts with faint streaking and a thin pointed bill. They have a faint line over their eyes and a faint broken eye ring. Females and immatures are duller in colour than males. Western birds are yellower than eastern birds.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{wildlife}} species, are, like the forests, dependent upon natural disturbance from fire and insect outbreaks. For example, {{at least three}} species of warbler (Cape May warbler, bay-breasted warbler and <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler),</b> have distributions and abundance related to spruce budworm outbreaks. [...] The black-backed woodpecker shows a preference for burnt over forests, where it forages for insects burrowing in the dead trees that remain standing. Fireweed, as the name suggests, is a plant that similar thrives in recently burned areas. Blueberries and huckleberries are also stimulated by fires, probably benefiting from the removal of shade, and the nutrients released in ashes. The resulting berries are an important food source for boreal forest animals.|$|E
50|$|The Nashville warbler was {{originally}} described as Sylvia ruficapilla by Alexander Wilson in 1811, using a name {{which had already}} been used by John Latham, {{but not in a}} valid description according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Possibly unintentionally, Wilson spelled its name as Sylvia rubricapilla in a later volume in 1812, and this spelling was once commonly used. The genus Sylvia is now restricted to Old World species of the family Sylviidae, unrelated to species such as the Nashville warbler, that are classified in the New World warbler family Parulidae. Until recently, most taxonomies have put this species in the genus Vermivora. However, this species forms a clade with several related species classed in Vermivora, such as the <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> and Lucy's warbler, which are more closely related to the flame-throated warbler and crescent-chested warbler than to other species of Vermivora. They therefore are now classified in the genus Oreothlypis along with the flame-throated and crescent-chested warblers, although the new genus Leothlypis was initially proposed for the Nashville warbler and allies, excluding the latter two species.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} over 180 species of birds, {{including}} at least 81 nesting species. Among these there are 12 species of raptors and 34 species of aquatic birds. Coniferous forests are frequented by ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula), the <b>Tennessee</b> <b>warbler</b> (Oreothlypis peregrina), the Nashville warbler (Oreothlypis ruficapilla), the magnolia warbler (Dendroica magnolia), the hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), the grosbeak (Hesperiphona vespertina) and the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). Mixed forests are occupied by the ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), the blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) and the purple finch (Carpodacus purpureus). The ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), the veery (Catharus fuscescens), the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), the eastern wood pewee (Contopus virens) and the sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) inhabit the hardwood forests. The most common raptors observed are (Pandion haliaetus) the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the barred owl (Strix varia) and the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). Aquatic areas servs as nesting habitat for the common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), the merganser (Mergus merganser), the black duck (Anas rubripes) and finally the common loon (Gavia immer), which is the emblem of the park. The park includes eight species at risk, the whip-poor-will (Caprimulgus vociferus), the nighthawk (Chordeiles minor), the chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica), the olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), the Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus).|$|E

40|$|Variation in {{population}} abundance reduces statistical power and complicates planning of effective monitoring programs. We studied patterns of temporal variation over space in six bird species in northern Alberta, Canada. Species with larger body mass {{did not have}} larger scales of population synchrony, but larger territory sizes were roughly associated with larger maximum extents of synchrony. The minimum extent of synchrony was 400 m to 600 m for all species examined, except Black-capped Chickadees Parus atricapillus, {{for which it was}} 1 km. Ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapillus, Red-breasted Nuthatches Sitta canadensis and Tennessee Warblers Vermivora peregrina were synchronous to 10 km, Black-capped Chickadee were synchronous to 7 km, while White-throated Sparrow Zonotrichia albicolis and Yellow-rumped Warbler Dendroica coronata did not show synchrony at any distance. Synchrony was strongest in Tennessee Warblers and Red-breasted Nuthatches; Red-breasted Nuthatches had a regular biannual cycle consistent with cone crop periodicity, while <b>Tennessee</b> <b>Warbler</b> abundance was related to spruce budworm abundance within Canada. Black-capped Chickadees are more abundant in warm years and may also be associated with large cone crops. Ovenbird abundance seems to depend on both local effects and factors on wintering grounds...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{with this}} report, Joel Jorgensen will write the reports for sub-passerines. Hopefully {{this will help}} with timeliness, {{especially}} in getting reports to the Regional Editor for Audubon Field Notes.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the influence of a}} spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) outbreak on a boreal mixed-wood bird community in forest stands ranging in age from 0 to 223 yr. We asked if (1) patterns of species response were consistent with the existence of spruce budworm specialists, i. e., species that respond in a stronger quantitative or qualitative way than other species; (2) the superabundance of food made it possible for species to expand their habitat use in age classes that were normally less used; and (3) the response to budworm was limited to specialists or was it more widespread. Results here indicated that three species, specifically the Bay-breasted Warbler (Dendroica castanea), <b>Tennessee</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Vermivora peregrina), and Cape May Warbler (Dendroica tigrina), had a larger numerical response to the budworm outbreak. They responded with increases in density of up to tenfold over 4 or 5 yr. No other species responded with more than a twofold increase in the same time period. These species also showed a functional response by breeding more frequently in young stands aged 1 - 21 yr and intermediate stands aged 22 - 36 yr as budworm numbers increased. Our data also suggested that many species profited to a lesser extent from budworm outbreaks, but that this effect may be too subtle to detect in most studies. We found evidence of a positive numerical effect in at least 18 additional species in one or two stand-age categories but never in all three for any one species. Given the numerical response in many species and the potential influence of budworm on bird populations because of the vast extent of outbreaks, we believe that the population cycle of spruce budworm should be considered in any evaluation of population trends in eastern boreal birds...|$|E

40|$|Long-distance {{migratory birds}} are declining {{globally}} and migration {{has been identified}} as the primary source of mortality in this group. Despite this, our lack of knowledge of habitat use and quality at stopovers, i. e., sites where the energy for migration is accumulated, remains a barrier to designing appropriate conservation measures, especially in tropical regions. There is therefore an urgent need to assess stopover habitat quality and concurrently identify efficient and cost-effective methods for doing so. Given that fuel deposition rates directly influence stopover duration, departure fuel load, and subsequent speed of migration, they are expected to provide a direct measure of habitat quality and have the advantage of being measurable through body-mass changes. Here, we examined seven potential indicators of quality, including body-mass change, for two ecologically distinct Neotropical migratory landbirds on stopover in shade-coffee plantations and tropical humid premontane forest during spring migration in Colombia: (1) rate of body-mass change; (2) foraging rate; (3) recapture rate; (4) density; (5) flock size; (6) age and sex ratios; and (7) body-mass distribution. We found higher rates of mass change in premontane forest than in shade-coffee in <b>Tennessee</b> <b>Warbler</b> Oreothlypis peregrina, a difference that was mirrored in higher densities and body masses in forest. In Gray-cheeked Thrush Catharus minimus, a lack of recaptures in shade-coffee and higher densities in forest, also suggested that forest provided superior fueling conditions. For a reliable assessment of habitat quality, we therefore recommend using a suite of indicators, taking into account each species' ecology and methodological considerations. Our results also imply that birds stopping over in lower quality habitats may spend a longer time migrating and require more stopovers, potentially leading to important carryover effects on reproductive fitness. Evaluating habitat quality is therefore imperative prior to defining the conservation value of newly identified stopover regions...|$|E
