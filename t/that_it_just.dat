5|$|The {{last chapter}} {{of the body of}} the book – if Chapter 10 is {{considered}} more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town. Finally, the market towns like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, former Marlboro {{marketer}} John Hogan {{disputed the}} claim that Pironi had gone back on a prior arrangement with Villeneuve. He said: [...] "Neither of them would ever have agreed to what effectively was throwing a race. I think Gilles was stunned somebody had out-driven him and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> caught him so much by surprise." [...] Hogan's company sponsored Pironi {{while he was at}} Ferrari. A comparison of the lap times of the two drivers showed that Villeneuve lapped far slower {{when he was in the}} lead, suggesting that he had indeed been trying to save fuel.|$|E

500|$|In July 2013, at a {{screening}} of Broadway Idiot, Mayer reported that the film adaptation was still happening, but production had not been scheduled due to [...] "Hollywood bullshit". In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The {{idea is to get}} it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There's {{not going to be a}} lot of dialogue and it probably should be a little shorter, too. After <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> takes its 'movie time' in getting done". He expected to finish it by the end of the month.|$|E
500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Yori and her user, Dr. Lora Baines, {{do not appear}} in the sequel, even though the film refers to Alan Bradley being married to Lora. Fans have lobbied for actress Cindy Morgan to be in the film with active campaigns online, such as [...] "Yori Lives" [...] on Facebook, which is independent of Morgan herself. [...] "All I know is what I'm seeing online," [...] Morgan said. [...] "I am so thrilled and touched and excited about the fan reaction and about people talking about the first one and how it relates to the second one. I can't tell you how warm a feeling I get from <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>just</b> means so much." [...] No one from Tron: Legacy had contacted Morgan, and she did not directly speak with anyone from the sequel's cast and crew. As Dr. Lora Baines, Cindy Morgan had appeared with Bruce Boxleitner (as Alan Bradley) at the Encom Press Conference in San Francisco, April 2, 2010.|$|E

500|$|Just as the Save Our Children {{campaign}} was a motivational force for conservative Christians, {{it was also}} one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, [...] "While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have {{marked the beginning of}} the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community". The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the Stonewall Library & Archives sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the Broward County Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered [...] "the best thing to happen to the gay rights movement. She and her cohorts were so over the top <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> completely galvanized the gay rights movement".|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>just</b> seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|... 11 overall {{received}} mixed, {{but mostly}} unflattering reviews from critics. Music reviewer Chris Jones from the BBC wrote generally positively about 11 in his review. He {{concluded that it}} was another strong album, even if Adams voice sounded dispassionate on some tracks. The Canadian website Jam! gave the album an average review. Reviewer Darryl Stedan found the lyrics clichéd, predictable and, while not criticising it, described it as an album [...] "that didn't really mean much." [...] Ryan Wasoba from the alternatively weekly magazine, Houston Press wrote favorably of the record in a backhanded way, commenting that 11's appeal laid in its [...] "inoffensiveness" [...] and [...] "digestibility". In another favorable review, Daily Mail writer Adrian Thrills said the album highlight was [...] "Oxygen", commenting on the similarities with the music of Bob Dylan. Amy O'Brian of The Vancouver Sun wrote favorably of the new album, {{while at the same}} time criticising it for its clichés, bad lyrics and for its too-familiar melodies, and concluded, [...] "It's cheesy and overdone, but the truth is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> might give Adams his first hit in a decade." ...|$|E

500|$|The Stone Tape remains well-regarded to this day. [...] Roger Fulton, {{writing in}} The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, calls it [...] "arguably the most creepy drama {{ever seen on}} television". The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as [...] "one of the masterpieces of genre television, an {{authentic}} alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics". Writer and member of The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape [...] "strikes a note <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it just has this impact on you, rather {{like being in the}} room itself. Extraordinary piece of work". [...] Writer Grant Morrison recalled The Stone Tape as [...] "really creepy and very memorable. Just brilliant images. That {{scared the hell out of}} me!". Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that [...] "The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre". Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as [...] "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today".|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Billboard, West revealed that he had worked with Chris Martin, the lead singer of the British alternative rock band Coldplay, on a song entitled [...] "Homecoming", and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> might possibly be released as the lead single for Graduation. The collaboration occurred the year before when Kanye West and Chris Martin met one another during an impromptu jam session at the Abbey Road Studios in London, England. West had just finished performing at a show that had been held at Abbey Road and the band just so happened to be recording their music in the recording studio {{at exactly the same}} time. The song in itself is actually a re-vamping for [...] "Home (Windy)", a track that originated from a demo tape dating back to the year 2001. It was made available two years later under the new title [...] "Home" [...] on West's 2003 mixtape Get Well Soon... and also on the advance copy of West's debut studio album The College Dropout, which due to a leak was never released. This original version possesses Kanye West's once trademark classic soul vocal sample production style, with singer John Legend on the chorus, which contains lyrics that are different than Martin's. This {{is due to the fact}} that Chris Martin asked Kanye West to change the song's lyrical content.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Taylor and the Junk Beer Kidnap Band would be performing at Rockfest in 2009. The group performed on April 24, 2009 at People's Court in Des Moines, Iowa, marking Taylor's first official solo show. Taylor performs with his band the Dum Fux, who make covers for 1970s punk rock and 1980s hair metal. Taylor also performs with Audacious P, {{a band that}} is primarily a Tenacious D cover band. Rapper Tech N9ne confirmed that Taylor was to perform on his album K.O.D., but was removed because Taylor did not submit his vocals in time. Taylor recently admitted that he tried out for the vacant singer spot in the band Velvet Revolver, but said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> did not work out. However, according to a recent Billboard article, it seems likely that he may in fact become the vocalist for Velvet Revolver, though no official confirmation has been made. Duff McKagan added that they can neither [...] "confirm or deny" [...] Taylor's membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the [...] "real deal". Slash has since ruled Corey out as the possible new vocalist explaining that [...] " [...] just wasn't right" [...] although he does love him. He however, has recorded 10 new songs with the band, drummer Matt Sorum stated it's unlikely it will ever be released. Taylor explained to Mark Hoppus on Hoppus on Music that McKagan and he were writing new music for a possible new supergroup.|$|E

500|$|Quantico was {{designed}} with over a half-dozen core characters, {{in addition to}} Alex Parrish, for pacing reasons. It was intended to have a flashback narrative, shifting between [...] "the present day with Parrish navigating her way through a class of FBI New Agent Trainees to the near future as the truth and repercussions of the attack emerge". Safran also used flashforwards to spread out the series' plot points. He said in a 2015 interview that although the series is [...] "intricately plotted", it {{does not intend to}} overwhelm the viewer, saying: [...] "It is tightly structured and moves quickly between two, sometimes three, time periods, but we made sure that it's not so complicated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> feels like too much. I like to say that {{we have a lot of}} tributaries, but they all lead to one ocean". The series' diverse cast has helped its writers create a variety of storylines and plot points. According to a Variety article on Safran and Quantico, [...] "The show delves below the surface into those disparate backgrounds to explore how each character’s personal stories influence their motivations for joining the FBI and in their perspective on the search for truth in the terrorism investigation. That offers a wealth of engaging material for writers to mine". Safran modeled Quantico on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in structure, with self-contained story arcs from season to season. Its producers said that each season would have a specific storyline, with Alex the series' focal point surrounded by a new cast.|$|E

[...] James Poniewozik of Time did not enjoy the flashforwards, commenting that they were [...] "the first of the flashforwards that resembled one of the bad old flashbacks, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> reconfirmed character traits we already knew and showed Jack and Kate falling into patterns we knew from the past … I didn't get much from it". [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.5/10, making it his least favorite episode of the season. [...] Carabott wrote that [...] "this season [...] seems to have been relegated to playing second fiddle … oddly enough, even in his own episode, Jack really isn't given much to do" [...] and stated that [...] "the possible rekindling of Jack and Kate's romantic relationship on the island is juxtaposed quite well with their relationship during the flashforward." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "the pace … was a bit too slow" [...] and [...] "I usually like the Jack-centered episodes, but a bout of appendicitis simply does not make for high drama or stimulating action"; however, he noted that [...] "all in all, this was a good episode, but it was nothing special." [...] Compora praised Fox's increasingly good acting, but said that [...] "this season has seen much stronger lead performances from Michael Emerson [...] and Henry Ian Cusick [...]" [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "a break after last week's action- and information-packed episode", argued that Rousseau was not given a proper death and enjoyed Rose and Bernard's roles. [...] UGO's Sara shared Martell's sentiments in regard to Rose and Bernard's appearances and speculated that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] would not be enjoyed by fans who like Rousseau or do not like Jack.

[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost."

[...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.
