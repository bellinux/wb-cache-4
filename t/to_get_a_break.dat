500|$|Vikram next {{featured}} in Rajapattai (2011) alongside Deeksha Seth {{under the direction}} of Suseenthiran where he played a henchman trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in the Tamil film industry. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics in December 2011 and performed below expectations at the box office. Vikram also completed half of a fantasy period film during 2011, Karikalan in which he played Karikala Chola, a Tamil king who ruled in 270 BC, opposite Zarine Khan {{under the direction of}} graphics director Kannan, but the film was later shelved owing to production troubles. He then appeared in his second project with director Vijay, portraying the lead role of a blinded RAW agent in the action-thriller, Thaandavam. The film, which also featured Anushka Shetty, Amy Jackson and Lakshmi Rai in pivotal roles, opened to mixed reviews in September 2012. For his role of a blind man, Vikram trained under noted human echolocation specialist Daniel Kish, with the latter also playing a cameo in the film. A critic from Sify.com noted that it was [...] "Vikram and him alone who diverts your attention from the film's little logical script flaws and spellbinds you with an endearing act that is Thaandavam's biggest strength"; subsequently the film did average business commercially. The actor was next seen portraying the title role in Bejoy Nambiar's bilingual David, which released with different cast members in Hindi and Tamil. Vikram remained the only common lead actor in the versions, with his segment playing out a love story between a careless drunkard fisherman and a mute girl played by Isha Sherwani. While the Tamil version opened to predominantly positive review, the Hindi film also won mixed reviews, with both films performing average business at the box office.|$|E
2500|$|The 1985 Wimbledon Championships final saw Evert play Navratilova for the fifth-time at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). [...] In {{the first}} set, Evert broke Navratilova {{in the third}} game of the set, which allowed her to go up on serve. [...] This {{would not be an}} {{uncomplicated}} set though for Evert because at five game to four with her serving for the match she had many complications. [...] Evert took the first point of the game on a volley that her opponent hit into the net. [...] Evert would find herself in a bind on break point in the first set, which Navratilova hit a backhand volley, but Evert reached it with a forehand shot. [...] Then she had to stave off another break point with a speedy forehand. [...] On the first set point, Evert misplayed a forehand to deep, and lost the point. [...] The second set point was played out by a weakly lobbed shot by Evert was tracked down by Navratilova, and her opponent played another lob back, which Evert played horridly overhead smash shot. [...] This was still barely strong enough to force a measger return by Navratilova, which Evert volley the ball into the corner to take the opening set six games to four. [...] In the second set, Evert could not get her playing level back from the first set. [...] Evert was at one-all love-30 on Navratilova's serve, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> point off of her, which in the subsequent game her opponent would break her serve and the score line was one game to three instead of the other way around. [...] Evert now found herself at two games to four and love-30 down, and got lambasted by four Navratilova winners. [...] At five games to three, Evert had two break points, but could not convert, which Evert lost the second set three games to six. [...] In the decider set, Evert was quickly put on the defensive by Navratilova in the first game, which she was down 15 points to love. [...] At this juncture, Evert saved those two break point opportunities, but on deuce came to net and got passed, which set up a three-times-a-charm break point and her opponent capitalized on the opening. [...] Evert could not get back on track because of the relentless nature to Navratilova's game, which in the last game was plagued by bad line calls and lost the set two games to six. [...] In the end, Evert never won a final appearance at Wimbledon against her arch-enemy Navratilova in all five-time they pair played in them together.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a low-tech fabric analysis on {{two types of}} fabrics found in Dutch archaeological context. This early-medieval pottery {{has been made in}} the German Rhine valley, close to Cologne, called „Vorgebirge‟. In this region, several potteries produced pottery with the same raw materials, which makes it hard to know their provenance. Two small villages, Badorf and Walberberg, are known to have produced a lot of pottery. The fabrics of these typical pots are light-coloured, mostly tempered with fine sand and baked at high temperatures. The produced forms are for instance relief-band amphorae, large vessels and cooking pots, but smaller forms also occur. The pottery was exported and traded by river (Rhine, lower Rhine, Meuse, IJssel) to early-medieval settlements in the lower countries and from there exported overseas. In Dutch archaeology, this typical pottery has been found at large-scale trade centres like Dorestad, but also on small sites related to big trade routes. The large quantity of sherds archaeologically found at Dorestad has been used to make a typology based on forms and fabrics. This typology is still used as a reference in processing sherds. The problem is that these sherds are examined on characteristics like colour and hardness, but those are problematic because of factors like baking atmosphere and post-deposition. However, with the low-tech fabric analysis it is possible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better notion in these fabrics. In this method a sample of a sherd is used, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fresh <b>break.</b> After preparation, this sample is re-baked at 900 °C <b>to</b> <b>get</b> disposed of sample-differences like moistness {{and to be able to}} reconstruct the original firing of the pots. Afterwards, the fresh breaks of these samples are all microscopically tested on several factors like calcite, colour and hardness subsequently, and their fabrics are described on porosity by looking at pores as well as on the main tempering and texture. By doing this, a distinction between the fabrics and a comparison with the results with other analyses can be made. The present low-tech fabric analysis on the Walberberg and Badorf fabrics sets a clear example of how useful this method is. It clarifies that several specified sherds should be determined differently...|$|R
