5|$|It is {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which {{the events of}} this war contributed {{to changes in the}} use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided {{with the end of the}} period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
25|$|The Fragility of Goodness {{confronts the}} ethical dilemma that {{individuals}} strongly committed to justice are nevertheless vulnerable to external {{factors that may}} deeply compromise or even negate their human flourishing. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which reason may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the Platonic notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the tragic playwrights and Aristotle in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability {{as a key to}} realizing the human good.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} deformity of {{the joint}} may get worse over time, or may remain static. A dog may have good X-rays and yet be in pain, or may have very poor X-rays and have no apparent pain issues. The hip condition is only one factor <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which dysplasia is causing pain or affecting the quality of life. In mild to moderate dysplasia it is often the secondary effects of abnormal wear and tear or arthritis, rather than dysplasia itself, which is the direct causes of visible problems.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{analysis}} from Peter Jones, a linguistics professor at Sheffield Hallam University, argued that Curtiss' earlier accounts of Genie's speech, {{up to and}} including her dissertation, were more accurate than those from after 1977. He argued that in these later analyses Curtiss did not provide sufficient evidence for many of her later conclusions, saying that she neither examined the utterances she cited in significant detail nor presented them in a manner conducive to doing so, and in a few instances asserted that Curtiss' data outright contradicted her conclusions. Jones wrote that, despite the tone of Curtiss' later works and interviews, he found nothing either suggesting reevaluation of her earlier arguments or disavowal of any of her earlier conclusions. In addition, he wrote that Curtiss did not release enough information about Genie's speech from after mid-1975 to determine exactly what, if any, grammatical abilities she had lost, and that the complete lack of data from any time after early January 1978 rendered it impossible <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which her language had regressed.|$|E
500|$|Because {{communication}} in ancient society was predominantly oral, {{it can be}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which regional or local languages continued to be spoken or used for other purposes under Roman rule. Some evidence exists in inscriptions, or in references in Greek and Roman texts to other languages and the need for interpreters. For Punic, Coptic, and Aramaic or Syriac, a significant amount of epigraphy or literature survives. The Celtic languages were widespread throughout much of western Europe, and while the orality of Celtic education left scant written records, Celtic epigraphy is limited in quantity but not rare. The Germanic languages of the Empire have left next to no inscriptions or texts, with the exception of Gothic. Multilingualism contributed to the [...] "cultural triangulation" [...] by means of which an individual who was neither Greek nor Roman might construct an identity through the processes of Romanization and Hellenization.|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{considered}} their sample of homosexual adults more representative than {{those used in}} previous studies, and argued {{that the fact that}} they examined blacks separately from whites, and men separately from women, helped them <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which patterns of homosexual and heterosexual development depend on race and sex. They wrote that while Bell, a psychologist and therapist, was [...] "relatively supportive of psychodynamic theory", Weinberg and Hammersmith were sociologists with a different theoretical perspective. They argued that their varying outlooks counteracted any bias due to their respective backgrounds. Bell et al. did not believe that completing their study earlier would have altered their findings. Believing that familiarity with scientific theories about homosexuality might bias their respondents′ answers, Bell et al. did not report results that could be explained through exposure to books, articles or scientific lectures about homosexuality. They used path analysis, a statistical technique originally developed for use in the biological sciences, to try to establish which factors were most important. Path analysis required dividing [...] "the independent variables into sequential stages, according to the time when their influences are most likely to occur." [...] The dependent variable Bell et al. wanted to explain, adult sexual preference, went at the final stage.|$|E

500|$|When {{describing}} the public reaction to Frank, historians mention {{the class and}} ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging {{the complexity of the}} case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian John Higham writes that [...] "economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of lynch law.... Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth." [...] Historian Nancy MacLean writes that some historians have argued that this was an American Dreyfus affair, which she said [...] " [...] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker." [...] Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself [...] "in a position of much latent tension and symbolism." [...] Stating that it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that [...] " [...] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, 'at his mercy'a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Racial {{and ethnic}} {{discrimination}} differentiates individuals {{on the basis}} of real and perceived racial and ethnic differences and leads to various forms of the ethnic penalty. It has been official government policy in several countries, such as South Africa during the apartheid era. Discriminatory policies towards ethnic minorities include the race-based discrimination of ethnic Indians and Chinese in Malaysia After the Vietnam war, many Vietnamese refugees moved to the United States, where they face discrimination. [...] Many studies report lower private sector earnings for racial minorities, although it is often difficult <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which this is the result of racial discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|Genes {{predispose}} individuals <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> {{which an}} individual may engage or interact with certain environments. Ridley exemplified that having ‘athletic’ genes makes one want to practice a sport, and having ‘intellectual’ genes makes one seek out intellectual activities. [...] "The genes are the agents of nurture {{and are more likely}} to be affecting appetite more than aptitude". Genes do not make the individual intelligent, the make them more likely to enjoy learning. [...] They encourage individuals to seek out environmental influences that will satisfy their appetites. [...] "The environment acts as a multiplier of small genetic differences, pushing athletic children toward the sports that reward them, and pushing bright children to the books that reward them".|$|E

2500|$|Finally, since a beam {{of light}} can be {{composed}} of many different wavelengths, <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which a physical color C in Hcolor stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to w), over the interval , of C(w)·s(w), of C(w)·m(w), and of C(w)·l(w). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color C (which is an element in Hcolor) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in R3color). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the [...] "physical" [...] space Hcolor can all result in the same single perceived color in R3color, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.|$|E
