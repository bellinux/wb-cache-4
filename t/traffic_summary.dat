40|$|Abstract—Numerous network anomaly {{detection}} techniques utilize <b>traffic</b> <b>summaries</b> (e. g., NetFlow records) {{to detect and}} diagnose attacks. In this paper we investigate the limits of such approaches, by introducing a technique by which compromised hosts can communicate without altering {{the behavior of the}} network as evidenced in summary records of many common types. Our technique builds on two key observations. First, network {{anomaly detection}} based on payload-oblivious <b>traffic</b> <b>summaries</b> admits a new type of covert embedding in which compromised nodes embed content in the space vacated by compressing the payloads of packets already in transit between them. Second, point-to-point covert channels can serve as a “data link layer ” over which routing protocols can be run, enabling more functional covert networking than previously explored. We investigate the combination of these ideas, which we term Summary-Invisible Networking (SIN), to determine both the covert networking capacities that an attacker can realize in various tasks and the possibilities for defenders to detect these activities.

40|$|Abstract. A user {{who wants}} to use a service {{forbidden}} by their site’s usage policy can masquerade their packets in order to evade detection. One masquerade technique sends prohibited traffic on TCP ports commonly used by permitted services, such as port 80. Users who hide their traffic in this way pose a special challenge, since filtering by port number risks interfering with legitimate services using the same port. We propose a set of tests for identifying masqueraded peer-to-peer file-sharing based on <b>traffic</b> <b>summaries</b> (flows). Our approach {{is based on the}} hypothesis that these applications have observable behavior that can be differentiated without relying on deep packet examination. We develop tests for these behaviors that, when combined, provide an accurate method for identifying these masqueraded services without relying on payload or port number. We test this approach by demonstrating that our integrated detection mechanism can identify BitTorrent with a 72 % true positive rate and virtually no observed false positives in control services (FTP-Data, HTTP, SMTP). ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Clearing of atherogenic {{lipoprotein}} particles by the liver requires hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP 1). This review highlights recent {{studies that have}} expanded {{our understanding of the}} molecular regulation and metabolic functions of LDLR and LRP 1 in the liver. Recent findings Various proteins orchestrate the intracellular trafficking of LDLR and LRP 1. After internalization, the receptors are redirected via recycling endosomes to the cell surface. Several new endocytic proteins that facilitate the endosomal trafficking of LDLR and consequently the clearance of circulating LDL cholesterol have recently been reported. Mutations in some of these proteins cause hypercholesterolemia in human. In addition, LRP 1 controls cellular cholesterol efflux by modulating the expression of ABCA 1 and ABCG 1, and hepatic LRP 1 protects against diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis through the regulation of insulin receptor <b>trafficking.</b> <b>Summary</b> LDLR and LRP 1 have prominent roles in cellular and organismal cholesterol homeostasis. Their functioning, including their trafficking in the cell, is controlled by numerous proteins. Comprehensive studies into the molecular regulation of LDLR and LRP 1 trafficking have advanced our fundamental understanding of cholesterol homeostasis, and these insights may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in the future...|$|R

This report describes the linkage of data from the 1999 – 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and traffic indicators from the 2005 National Highway Planning Network. Methods—The residential addresses of NHANES participants were used to assign the distance to the nearest road, the number of roads within concentric buffers of specific radii, and the average annual daily <b>traffic.</b> <b>Summaries</b> of these <b>traffic</b> indicators by participant characteristics, including urbanization of their county of residence, race and ethnicity, poverty status, and health status, were tabulated.

40|$|This {{research}} uses {{data collected}} from a university campus network via Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) monitoring and from the largest public BitTorrent tracker to characterize the extent of unauthorized transfers of copyrighted content using Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and limitations of DPI in detection of such activity, both to provide a perspective of how much copyright infringement happens using P 2 P and to inform those seeking to deploy DPI technology. Use of P 2 P and transfers of copyrighted content were widespread on campus. In Spring 2008, 40 % of students living on campus were detected using a P 2 P protocol, 70 % of which were observed attempting to transfer copyrighted material. In late 2010, we estimate that over 800 million copies of content were transferred globally using BitTorrent per day, with an estimated number of transferred songs 13. 1 times greater than worldwide sales of songs, and estimated number of transferred movies 6. 8 times greater than worldwide box-office sales and 16. 4 times greater than U. S. DVD and Blu-ray sales. Most transfers were from a small number of very popular titles that were widely available for sale. We found no evidence that use of P 2 P to transfer content without violating copyright was common both on campus and global BitTorrent. This indicates that copyright law is violated frequently using P 2 P, and while we cannot quantify how P 2 P transfers translate to lost sales, {{it is reasonable to assume}} some sales are lost due to P 2 P. Focusing on effectiveness of DPI, after a couple weeks of monitoring DPI found up to 80 % of detected P 2 P users attempting to transfer copyrighted content. In the short term, DPI could be effective to assess which network users transfer copyrighted content using P 2 P given some weeks of monitoring. However, limitations such as not being able to detect users of encrypted P 2 P can reduce DPIʼs effectiveness in the long term. Using behavioral classifiers that we implemented and that can detect encrypted BitTorrent from <b>traffic</b> <b>summaries,</b> we found students shifting from unencrypted to encrypted BitTorrent in the 2007 - 2008 academic year.

Meeting diverse delay requirements {{is one of the}} most critical goals for the design of 5 G wireless networks. Though the delay of point-to-point communications has been well investigated, the delay of multi-point to multi-point communications has not been thoroughly studied since it is a complicated function of all links in the network. In this work, we propose a novel tractable approach to analyze the delay in the heterogenous cellular networks with spatio-temporal random arrival of traffic. Specifically, we propose the notion of delay outage and evaluated the effect of different scheduling policies on the delay performance. Our numerical analysis reveals that offloading policy based on cell range expansion greatly reduces the macrocell traffic while bringing a small amount of growth for the picocell traffic. Our results also show that the delay performance of round-robin scheduling outperforms first in first out scheduling for heavy traffic, and it is reversed for light <b>traffic.</b> In <b>summary,</b> this analytical framework provides an understanding and a rule-of-thumb for the practical deployment of 5 G systems where delay requirement is increasingly becoming a key concern.

In this paper, we describe Street Viewer, a system capable of analyzing the traffic behavior in different scenarios from images taken with an off-the-shelf optical camera. Street Viewer operates in real time on embedded hardware architectures with limited computational resources. The system features a pipelined architecture that, on one side, allows one to exploit multi-threading intensively and, on the other side, allows one to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the system, since each layer is aimed at refining for the following layers the information it receives as input.

30|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the {{duration}} of the CFP phase has {{a significant impact on the}} delay encountered by the HP traffic. This is because, the longer the CFP (to accommodate the several LP flows in a network), the more the time required for the system to transition into the CP, thereby making the HP traffic wait for a longer period of time to get an opportunity to transmit their delay sensitive data. We intend to address this issue in a quantitative manner in our future study. In Section 4, we provide a numerical analysis of the above fact. We want to emphasize that an absence of LP traffic flow in the network will make our scheme behave exactly in the standard 802.11 e fashion. Thus, no undue delay will be encountered by the HP <b>traffic</b> flows. In <b>summary,</b> the extra opportunity to transmit data by the LP flows during the CFP phase leads to significant increase in their throughput with minor dent in the delay performance of the HP flows.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that protein interactions with phospholipids, particularly phosphoinositides, serve to regulate many different cellular processes. Due to the charged nature of biomembranes, electrostatic interactions are particularly effective between proteins and lipids at membrane interfaces where protein oligomerization and locally high charge densities of certain phospholipids can contribute significantly to cellular processes. Phosphoinositide distributions contribute to organelle identity, recruit proteins important for anterograde or retrograde trafficking {{to the right place}} at the right time, and directly influence the capacity of proteins to signal to downstream partners. Our studies provide evidence in support of the importance of protein-lipid interactions in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity and signaling, as well as in biosynthetic trafficking from the endoplasmic recticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane (PM). The polybasic juxtamembrane (JX) region of EGFR has been proposed to regulate protein activity by interacting with the PM and thus preventing tyrosine kinase domain activation. We demonstrate that reduction of the net charge of the JX region in wild-type EGFR results in constitutive activation of the receptor and conferral of its capacity to transform cells in a ligand-independent manner. These capabilities are maintained when the receptor is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, we show that the polybasic JX region also plays a positive role in the response of EGFR to ligand. Receptors in which the net positive charge of the JX region is reduced show reduced activation and are deficient in downstream signaling, including their capacity to mediate Ca 2 + mobilization. In addition, we demonstrate that protein-lipid interactions also contribute to proper biosynthetic trafficking in cells. We provide pharmacological and molecular genetic evidence for the functional requirement of a pool of phosphoinositide 4 -phosphate, synthesized by phosphoinositide 4 -kinase III[alpha], for ER to PM protein <b>trafficking.</b> In <b>summary,</b> strategies to perturb both protein structure and phospholipid availability provide evidence in support of roles for basic amino acid sequences and negatively charged phospholipids in biosynthetic trafficking and cellular signaling regulation. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial Na+ {{channels}} (ENaC) {{coexist with}} a family of ATP-gated ion channels known as P 2 X receptors in the renal collecting duct. Although ENaC is itself insensitive to extracellular ATP, tubular perfusion of ATP can modify the activity of ENaC. To investigate a possible regulatory relationship between P 2 X receptors and ENaC, coexpression studies were performed in Xenopus oocytes. ENaC generated a persistent inward Na+ current that was sensitive to the channel blocker amiloride (I(am-s)). Exogenous ATP transiently activated all cloned isoforms of P 2 X receptors, which in some cases irreversibly inhibited I(am-s). The degree of inhibition depended on the P 2 X receptor subtype present. Activation of P 2 X 2, P 2 X(2 / 6), P 2 X 4, and P 2 X(4 / 6) receptor subtypes inhibited I(am-s), whereas activation of P 2 X 1, P 2 X 3, and P 2 X 5 receptors had no significant effect. The degree of inhibition of I(am-s) correlated positively {{with the amount of}} ionic charge conducted by P 2 X receptor subtypes. ENaC inhibition required Na+ influx through I(am-s) -inhibiting P 2 X ion channels but also Ca 2 + influx through P 2 X 4 and P 2 X(4 / 6) ion channels. P 2 X-mediated inhibition of I(am-s) was found to be due to retrieval of ENaC from the plasma membrane. Maximum amplitudes of ATP-evoked P 2 X-mediated currents (I(ATP)) were significantly increased for P 2 X 2, P 2 X(2 / 6), and P 2 X 5 receptor subtypes after coexpression of ENaC. The increase in I(ATP) was due to increased levels of plasma membrane-bound P 2 X receptor protein, suggesting that ENaC modulates protein <b>trafficking.</b> In <b>summary,</b> ENaC was downregulated by the activation of P 2 X 2, P 2 X(2 / 6), P 2 X 4, and P 2 X(4 / 6) receptors.

40|$|The apicomplexan {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum is the causative {{agent of}} the most severe form of malaria with more than 600 000 death cases per year, mainly among young children and pregnant women. The development of the parasite within human erythrocytes is accompanied by extensive remodelling of the host cells. The establishment of nutrient acquisition pathways, the genesis of membranous structures within the red blood cell (RBC) cytosol {{and the formation of}} a cytoadherence complex {{on the surface of the}} host cell represent important examples of these modifications that contribute both to parasite survival and virulence. For this purpose P. falciparum exports hundreds of effector proteins into the RBC with the majority of them bearing a characteristic pentameric sequence termed Plasmodium export element (PEXEL), which is cleaved in the parasite after the third and N-terminally acetylated at the fourth amino acid position. To gain a better understanding of this important export signal, a mutagenesis screen on the PEXEL motif (48 RLLAQ 52) of a GFP-tagged model protein (STEVOR 1 - 80) was conducted in this study. The localization of the mutant proteins to different compartments of the parasitized erythrocyte was determined by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, mass spectrometric analysis of representative mutants confirmed a correlation between processing of the export motif and protein <b>trafficking.</b> In <b>summary,</b> amino acid replacements within position 1 (R 48) and 3 (L 50), representing the most conserved amino acids, had detrimental effects on PEXEL cleavage and protein export. In contrast, positions 2 (L 49) and 5 (Q 52) proved to be more permissive towards mutations and mostly maintained the wild-type export phenotype. Special attention was paid to position 4 (A 51), which is acetylated after cleavage and appeared more restricted than originally assumed. One interesting finding was the deficiency of non-acetylated mutant proteins to be exported into the host cell indicating N-terminal acetylation as a prerequisite for proper targeting of PEXEL proteins. Consequently, the second part of this study focussed on the characterization of a putative N-acetyltransferase (PfNAT) that might be responsible for this allegedly important post-translational modification. The localization of the candidate transferase to the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, the compartment of PEXEL processing, was confirmed by single crossover integration of a GFP tag into the endogenous locus. Despite the use of two different approaches, the attempted deletion of the gene for loss-of-function studies was unsuccessful. However, a conditional downregulation of protein levels by 50...|$|R

Despite that the application of MSNs {{in the field of}} intracellular drug delivery is still at its infancy very exciting breakthroughs have been achieved in the last years. A general review of the most recent progress in this area of research is presented, including a description of the latest findings on the pathways of entry into live mammalian cells together with the intracellular <b>trafficking,</b> a <b>summary</b> on the contribution of MSNs to the development of site-specific drug delivery systems, a report on the biocompatibility of this material in vitro and in vivo, and a discussion on the most recent breakthroughs in the synthesis and application of stimuli-responsive mesoporous silica-based delivery vehicles. A gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) -capped MSNs-based intracellular photoinduced drug delivery system (PR-AuNPs-MSNs) for the controlled release of anticancer drug inside of human fibroblast and liver cells was synthesized and characterized. We found that the mesoporous channels of MSNs could be efficiently capped by the photoresponsive AuNPs without leaking the toxic drug, paclitaxel, inside of human cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the cargo-release property of this PR-AuNPs-MSNs system could be easily photo-controlled under mild and biocompatible conditions in vitro. In collaboration with Renato Mortera (a visiting student from Italy), a MSNs based intracellular delivery system for controlled release of cell membrane impermeable cysteine was developed. A large amount of cysteine molecules were covalently attached to the silica surface of MSNs through cleavable disulfide linkers. These cysteine-containing nanoparticles were efficiently endocytosed by human cervical cancer cells HeLa. These materials exhibit 450 times higher cell growth inhibition capability than that of the conventional N-acetylcysteine prodrug. The ability to functionalize the surface of the MSNs with organic groups was used as a way to incorporate functional molecules that can interact with intracellular structures. A series of oligonucleotides intercalating (propidium) derivative functionalized MSNs (PAP-LP-MSNs and AP-PAP-MSNs) materials were synthesized. We selectively decorated the exterior particle surface of PAP-LP-MSN and the interior pore surface of AP-PAP-MSN with the oligonucleotide intercalating functionality. We observed that these materials are internalized by HeLa cells despite that the propidium group is known by its cell membrane impermeable properties. By confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we demonstrated that indeed PAP-LP-MSNs were able to bind to cytoplasmic oligonucleotides; such as messenger RNA, resulting in severe cell growth inhibition. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of AP-PAP-MSN, where the same oligonucleotide intercalating molecules were anchored inside the pores, was significantly lowered upon the endocytosis by HeLa cells. The results obtained prove that the biocompatibility and cell membrane trafficking properties of MSNs could be modified by selective functionalization of the two different surfaces (exterior particle and interior pore surfaces) and morphology control of MSNs...|$|R
30|$|Clustering is {{a popular}} {{approach}} taken by researchers to detect botnets using flow based features. Zeidanloo et al. have proposed a botnet detection framework that can detect botnets without prior knowledge of them by finding similar communication patterns and behaviors among the group of hosts that are performing at least one malicious activity using X-means clustering [21]. Using Audit Record Generation and Utilization System (ARGUS) [22], the authors have collected flow based information such as source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, duration, protocol, number of packets, and number of bytes transferred in both directions, which are later used to detect the group of hosts that exhibit similar behavior and communication pattern. Karasaridis et al. [23] have developed a K-means based method that employs scalable non-intrusive algorithms that analyze vast amounts of <b>summary</b> <b>traffic</b> data. Gu et al. [24] have proposed a novel anomaly-based botnet detection system that is independent of the protocol and structure used by botnets. This detection system has exploited the essential definition and properties of botnets, i.e., bots within the same botnet exhibit similar C&C communication patterns and similar malicious activities patterns. It utilizes a number of flow based information such as time, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, duration, {{and the number of}} packets and bytes transferred in both directions. A C-plane clustering method is used to read the communication logs generated by C plane monitor and finds clusters that share similar communication pattern. Arshad et al. [25] have developed an anomaly-based method that require not a priori knowledge of bot signatures, botnet C&C protocols, and the C&C server addresses. Flow characteristics such as IP, port, packet event times, and bytes per packet are examined by Amini et al. [26] to detect botnets where these NetFlow data is collected, filtered, and is finally clustered using hierarchical clustering. Rule based methods are then applied to refine the clusters to reduce the percentage of false positives.|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} effects of bacterial DNA on immune surveillance in ovine lymph nodes (LN). The first study identified long-term changes in lymph nodes following exposure to plasmid DNA. Treated lymph nodes were heavier and had larger medullary areas. Furthermore, medullary cord thickness and medullary sinus width as well as germinal center size and number were increased in plasmid treated lymph nodes. To determine whether bacterial DNA altered cell trafficking through lymph nodes, the efferent lymphatic of the prescapular LN of sheep was cannulated and cells were collected. Intradermal injection of as little as 4 ìg of plasmid DNA expressing the green fluorescent protein of jellyfish (eGFP) caused a marked increase in the cell trafficking through the prescapular lymph node. A dose-dependent facet existed for this response, as the increase in cell trafficking response persisted longer with 40 ìg or 400 ìg of plasmid-eGFP than with 4 ìg. This increased cell trafficking was independent of green fluorescent protein expression as both pCAN 1 -eGFP and pCAN 1 induced similar responses. Increased cell traffic induced by bacterial DNA was further characterized by determining whether bacterial DNA form was critical for this response. Treatment with intact plasmid (circular) DNA induced the greatest increase in cell traffic. In contrast, when plasmid DNA was digested with restriction enzymes into linear fragments of DNA, then cell trafficking was not significantly increased. Numerous studies have shown that immunostimulatory guanosine-cytosine (CpG) motifs activate cells in vitro and can improve protective immune responses in vivo. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that the presence of immunostimulatory CpG motifs within plasmids was responsible for altering cell trafficking. It was shown that plasmids with added immunostimulatory CpG sequences affected cell trafficking in a dose-dependent manner. The injection of 40 ìg of pBISIA- 88 caused an increase in cell trafficking while injecting 400 ìg pBISIA- 88 failed to increase cell flow above control levels. Analysis of cell populations collected in efferent lymph gives insight into treatment effects on immune surveillance. This is well-studied following treatment with antigen and in general, antigen induces a selective movement of cells into lymph that occurs 24 hours post-treatment. In contrast, plasmid DNA induced a rapid, non-selective movement of lymphocytes through the lymph node, suggesting that bacterial DNA and antigen may affect cell trafficking by different mechanisms and thereby have distinct effects on immune surveillance. Short-term effects of bacterial DNA on lymph node architecture and cellular composition were also investigated to determine whether an increase in cell trafficking was associated with structural changes within the lymph node. While it was shown that bacterial DNA induced changes within a lymph node, including and increased number of germinal centers and an increased frequency of CD 72 *CD 21 * B cells, these changes were not correlated to increased cell <b>trafficking.</b> In <b>summary,</b> bacterial DNA altered immune surveillance in sheep lymph nodes by changing cell traffic and lymph node architecture and composition. Many of these responses differed from responses observed by others following antigen treatment. The present observations suggest that bacterial DNA can function as an important signal to modulate immune surveillance and host responses to infections by pathogens...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 194 cows were {{randomly}} assigned into one of two treatment groups (Group A and cross over design Group B), with groups balanced for milk yield, days in milk (DIM) and parity. Group A grazed soybean {{in the first period}} and pasture in the second, while Group B grazed pasture followed by soybean. The herd was managed with controlled cow traffic and milked by a prototype Robotic Rotary (RR; Automatic Milking Rotary (AMR™), DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden). In controlled cow traffic cows pass one-way gates and automatic drafting gates were they will be recognized and sent to the milking unit or straight to the feeding area if the time since the last milking was less than the minimum milking interval. The trial consisted of two periods of seven days; four habituation days and three trial days. Before the habituation days all the cows had two training days on soybean. Between 0900 and 1500, cows had access to their treatment paddock following milking. Throughout the remainder of the day, treatment groups grazed shared paddocks as a combined herd. Behavioural observations in both treatment paddocks were recorded every 15 minutes starting at 0900 using scan sampling. Behaviours were recorded as: standing idle, lying idle/resting, walking, grazing, standing ruminating, lying ruminating and ‘other’ behaviour. Grazing, lying resting and standing were used for the analysis of cow behaviour. Day, period, cow number, lactation, group, treatment, DIM, yield and the milking interval were also considered in the analyses. A linear mixed model was used to analyze the cow <b>traffic</b> data, while <b>summary</b> statistics were used to describe trends in the behavioural data. Cows tended to graze more in the soybean paddock compared to pasture. They also grazed more during the morning compared to the afternoon. There was a difference in milking interval between cows grazing soybean and grass, where it was shorter when cows grazed soybean, however the difference was not significant. Lactation, DIM and yield had a significant effect on milking interval. Results indicated that grazing soybean did not act as an incentive to increase voluntary cow traffic despite a small difference in milking interval being detected...|$|R
40|$|Non-technical <b>summary</b> <b>Traffic</b> {{carried over}} two {{branches}} of the sympathetic nervous system can be recorded in cooperative human subjects, with fine needles inserted directly into leg nerves. We made simultaneous recordings of sympathetic activity with two needles inserted into nerve tracts supplying skin and muscles, and used a mathematical method, wavelet phase coherence, to obtain insights into how the brain regulates neural oscillations. Our results document continuously varying and coherently coupled human skin and muscle sympathetic nerve oscillations over time (suggesting that they are driven by other central frequency generators). Abstract Frequency-domain analyses of simultaneously recorded skin and muscle sympathetic nerve activities may yield unique information on otherwise obscure central processes governing human neural outflows. We used wavelet transform and wavelet phase coherence methods to analyse integrated skin and muscle sympathetic nerve activities and haemodynamic fluctuations, recorded from nine healthy supine young men. We tested two null hypotheses: (1) that human skin and muscle sympathetic nerve activities oscillate congruently; and (2) that whole-body heating affects these neural outflows and their haemodynamic consequences in similar ways. Measurements included peroneal nerve skin and tibial nerve muscle sympathetic activities; the electrocardiogram; finger photoplethysmographic arterial pressure; respiration (controlled at 0. 25 Hz, and registered with a nasal thermistor); and skin temperature, sweating, and laser-Doppler skin blood flow. We made recordings at ∼ 27 °C, for ∼ 20 min, and then during room temperature increases to ∼ 38 °C, over 35 min. We analysed data with a wavelet transform, using the Morlet mother wavelet and wavelet phase coherence, to determine the frequencies and coherences of oscillations over time. At 27 °C, skin and muscle nerve activities oscillated coherently, at ever-changing frequencies between 0. 01 and the cardiac frequency (∼ 1 Hz). Heating significantly augmented oscillations of skin sympathetic nerve activity and skin blood flow, arterial pressure, and R-R intervals, {{over a wide range}} of low frequencies, and modestly reduced coordination between skin and muscle sympathetic oscillations. These results suggest that human skin and muscle sympathetic motoneurones are similarly entrained by external influences, including those of arterial baroreceptors, respiration, and other less well-defined brainstem oscillators. Our study provides strong support for the existence of multiple, time-varying central sympathetic neural oscillators in human subjects...|$|R
40|$|The work of VRU-TOO is {{targeted}} specifically at {{the application of}} ATT for reducing risk and improving comfort (e. g. minimisation of delay) for Vulnerable Road Users, namely pedestrians. To achieve this, the project operates at three levels. At the European level practical pilot implementations in three countries (U. K., Portugal and Greece) are linked with behavioural studies of the micro-level interaction of pedestrians and vehicles {{and the development of}} computer simulation models. At the National level, the appropriate Highway Authorities are consulted, according to their functions, for the pilot implementations and informed of the results. Finally, at the local level, the pilot project work is fitted into specfic local (municipality) policy contexts in all three pilot project sites. The present report focuses on the Elefsina pilot application in Greece and the relevant National and Local policy contexts are the following. At the National level, the ultimate responsibility for road safety and signal installations rests with the Ministry of Environment and Public Works. The Ministry is responsible for the adoption of standards and solutions for problems and also for a large number of actual installations, since local authorities lack the size and expertise to undertake such work on their own One of the project's aims is to provide information to the Ministry as to the suitability of the methods developed for aiding pedestrian movement, ultimately leading to a specification for its wider use. The Ministry is expecting to use the final {{results of the present study}} for possible modifications of its present standards for pedestrian controlled traffic signals. At the local level (Elefsina) the municipality has, in the past, pursued environmental improvements through pedestrianisation schemes in the city centre. At the same time it has developed a special traffic management policy, to solve a particularly serious problem of through <b>traffic.</b> A <b>summary</b> of the policy is contained in Appendix A and more details in a previous deliverable (Tillis, 1992). In the particular case of Elefsina pedestrian induced delay to through vehicular traffic, may form a key element in this policy ensuring at the same time, an incentive to divert to the existing bypass and enhancing pedestrian movement. The effectiveness of pedestrian detection techniques tested in the pilot, will provide valuable information on the future implementation of the policy. Thus, the Elefsina Pilot Project operates at the same time on three levels: It provides a basis, in combination with the other two pilot project sites, for comparing the effects of pedestrian detection on pedestrian safety and comfort at a European level. It provides information to the National authorities (Ministry of Environment and Public Works) for their standards setting, scheme design and implementation tasks. It fits into a comprehensive plan at the local level for effecting environmental improvements and enhancing pedestrian amenity and comfort at the same time. In addition, an investigation into the capabilities of pedestrian detectors to function as data collection devices, was performed. The data 'quality gap' betweenvehicular and pedestrian tr&c may be closed with the utilisation of microwave pedestrian detectors, providing a more solid foundation for the planning for total person movement through networks (vehicle occupants, public transport passengers, pedestrians). This the second deliverable issued for Elefsina and comprises of the main section which contains a description of the work undertaken, the results and a number of appendices serving as background material in support of the statements in the main text...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the working}} {{title of a}} {{workshop}} planned {{to take place in}} April 2012 as a step towards developing a grant proposal to meet the criteria of an appropriate EU framework call in the area of health policy and governance. The core idea is an interest in the use of expertise, standards and technologies {{on the one hand and}} on the other hand variations in adherence of patients to prescribed treatment - typically across a number of different lifestyle-related diseases or ailments, in comparison between a number of European countries. The focus would, more specifically, be on two aspects: evidence-basing of relevant treatments and patient adherence to expert recommendations for preventive purposes in the cases of the disease categories selected. At this point the selection of disease categories to focus on in the workshop and the grant proposal is left open; the following are only named as examples: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity, Type 2 diabetes and certain infectious diseases. This is in view of the urgent call to action issued by the WHO Regional Office for Europe in its Summary Report 2005 on European Health which identifies the high risks to health, related to tobacco and alcohol consumption, high blood pressure and cholesterol, overweight, low fruit and vegetable intake, and physical inactivity. The report urges that these health risks need to be dealt with in order to help prevent ischaemic heart disease, unipolar depressive disorders, cerebrovascular disease, alcohol-use disorders, chronic pulmonary disease, lung cancer and road <b>traffic</b> injury. The <b>summary</b> has a special focus on children’s health, because health in childhood determines health throughout life and into the next generation (WHO 2005). The present initiative comes from a group of scholars at the University of Gothenburg who have over the years done research that falls within the realm of science and technology studies (STS). Coming out of an amalgam of studies of scientific controversies, the role of expertise, critical studies of public understanding of science, scientific citizenship and governance issues, and earlier work in the field of science policy studies, several members of the group have now come to focus particularly on Studies of Medicine, Expertise and Controversies (SMEC).

40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{population}} and increase of travelling requirements in metropolitan areas, public transit has been recognized as a promising remedy and is playing an ever more important role in sustainable transportation systems. However, {{the development of the}} public transit system has not received enough attention until the recent emergence of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). In the conventional public transit system, little to no communication passes between transit vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, such as traffic signals and loop detectors. But now, thanks to advancements in automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems and wireless communication, real-time and high-resolution information of the movement of transit vehicles has become available, which may potentially facilitate the development of more advanced traffic control and management systems. This dissertation introduces a novel adaptive traffic signal control system, which utilizes the real-time location information of transit vehicles. By predicting the movement of the transit vehicle based on continuous detection of the vehicle motion by the on-board AVL system and estimating the measures of effectiveness (MOE) of other motor vehicles based on the surveillance of traffic conditions, optimal signal timings can be obtained by solving the proposed traffic signal optimization models. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed system improves a transit vehicle's operation as well as minimizes its negative impacts on other motor vehicles in the <b>traffic</b> system. In <b>summary,</b> there are three major contributions of this dissertation: a) development of a novel AVL-based adaptive traffic signal control system; b) modeling of the associated traffic signal timing optimization problem, which is the key component of the proposed system; c) applications of the proposed system to two real world cases. After presenting background knowledge on two major types of transit operations, i. e., preemption and priority, traffic signal control and AVL systems, the architecture of the proposed adaptive signal control system and the associated algorithm are presented. The proposed system includes a data-base, fleet equipped with surveillance system, traffic signal controllers, a transit movement predictor, a traffic signal timing optimizer and a request server. The mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) and nonlinear programming (NP) are used to formulate signal timing optimization problems. Then the proposed system and algorithm are applied to two real-world case studies. The first case study concerns the SPRINTER rail transit service. The proposed adaptive signal control (ASC) system is developed to relieve the traffic congestion and to clear the accumulated vehicle queues at the isolated signal around the grade crossing, based on the location information on SPRINTER from PATH-developed cellular GPS trackers. The second case study involves the San Diego trolley system. With the information provided by the AVL system, the proposed ASC system predicts the arrival times of the instrumented trolley at signals and provides the corresponding optimal signal timings to improve the schedule adherence, thus reducing the delays at intersections and enhancing the trip reliability for the trolley travelling along a signalized corridor in the downtown area under the priority operation. The negative impact (e. g., delay increase) on other traffic is minimized simultaneously. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests in the microscopic environment are conducted using the PARAMICS software to validate the proposed system for the aforementioned applications. The results present a promising future for further field operational testing...|$|R
