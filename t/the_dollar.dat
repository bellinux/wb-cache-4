2500|$|The term [...] "dollar" [...] {{has also}} been adopted by other {{countries}} for currencies which do not share a common history with other dollars. Many of these currencies adopted the name after moving from a £sd-based to a decimalized monetary system. Examples include <b>the</b> Australian <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Jamaican <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Cayman Islands <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Fiji <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Namibian <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesian <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Zimbabwe <b>dollar,</b> and <b>the</b> Solomon Islands <b>dollar.</b>|$|R
50|$|The G10 {{currencies}} are <b>the</b> United States <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling, the Swiss franc, <b>the</b> Australian <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar,</b> <b>the</b> Swedish krona, and the Norwegian krone.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> new Jamaican <b>dollar</b> (and <b>the</b> Cayman Islands <b>dollar)</b> {{differed}} from all <b>the</b> other <b>dollars</b> in <b>the</b> British West Indies {{in that it}} was essentially a half-pound sterling; <b>the</b> other <b>dollars</b> either began on <b>the</b> US <b>dollar</b> unit or <b>the</b> Spanish <b>dollar</b> unit.|$|R

5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance of <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the {{continued use of}} silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar against his better judgment.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, {{who tried to}} use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Spanish <b>dollar</b> unit {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>the</b> American <b>dollar</b> unit. <b>The</b> American <b>dollar</b> unit was first introduced in the USA in the year 1792, based on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish <b>dollars.</b> As such, <b>the</b> American <b>dollar</b> was marginally less valuable than <b>the</b> Spanish <b>dollar.</b>|$|R
25|$|On world markets, <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> {{historically}} {{tended to}} move in tandem with <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar.</b> An apparently rising Canadian <b>dollar</b> (against <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar)</b> was decreasing against other international currencies; however, during the rise of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> since 2002, it has gained value against <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> {{as well as other}} international currencies. In recent years, dramatic fluctuations in the value of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar</b> have tended to correlate with shifts in oil prices, reflecting <b>the</b> Canadian <b>dollar's</b> status as a petrocurrency owing to Canada's significant oil exports.|$|R

5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} <b>the</b> <b>dollar's</b> decline {{relative}} to {{its peak in}} 2002 depends upon {{the composition of the}} basket of currencies used in calculating <b>the</b> <b>dollars</b> value. Further, <b>the</b> appropriate index depends upon the question being asked, with the type of price deflators used if any dependent upon the question at hand. Various measures of <b>the</b> <b>dollars</b> value are discussed, and compared, including alternative weights based on liabilities and assets, instead of the standard trade flow weights...|$|R
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> return on dollar deposits is equal to <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|France voiced {{concerns}} over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the Vietnam War. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold {{as part of the}} Nixon Shock. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b> These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates. Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> price of gold was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the Smithsonian Agreement signed by the G-10 members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years. The system's erosion was expedited not only by <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> devaluations that occurred, but also by the oil crises of the 1970s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar recycling and balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) {{began to}} issue their second series of coins. The {{coat of arms}} is {{displayed}} on the obverse side of these coins, surrounded by an inscription comprising the name of Singapore in the four official languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil and English) and the year of minting.

25|$|Newfoundland went decimal in 1865, {{but unlike}} the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based on <b>the</b> Spanish <b>dollar</b> rather than on <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar,</b> {{and there was a}} slight {{difference}} between these two units. <b>The</b> U.S. <b>dollar</b> was created in 1792 {{on the basis of the}} average weight of a selection of worn Spanish <b>dollars.</b> As such, <b>the</b> Spanish <b>dollar</b> was worth slightly more than <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar,</b> and likewise, <b>the</b> Newfoundland <b>dollar,</b> until 1895, was worth slightly more than <b>the</b> Canadian colonial <b>dollar.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Straits <b>dollar</b> was {{introduced}} in Brunei in 1906. It was later replaced by <b>the</b> Malayan <b>dollar</b> which {{was introduced}} to British colonies and Brunei in 1939. It replaced <b>the</b> Straits <b>dollar</b> at par with a 1:1 exchange rate. <b>The</b> Malayan <b>dollar</b> was issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency in Malaya. The board stopped issuing <b>the</b> Malayan <b>dollar</b> during <b>the</b> Japanese invasion during World War II. <b>The</b> Malayan <b>dollar</b> had <b>the</b> portrait of King George VI {{in front of the}} note.|$|R
5|$|In late 1944 {{the prisoners}} had counterfeited {{the reverse of}} <b>the</b> <b>dollar,</b> and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the serial number, whose {{algorithm}} was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically inferior to the genuine notes.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} were soon partially allayed. With {{the global economy}} doing well, China was able to abandon its dollar peg in 2005, allowing a substantial appreciation of the Yuan up to 2007, while still increasing its exports. <b>The</b> <b>dollar</b> peg was later re-established as the financial crises began to reduce China's export orders.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's name on <b>the</b> <b>dollar,</b> {{and the design}} was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E

5|$|All {{dates of}} <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, {{rather than as}} part of a larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on <b>the</b> <b>dollar.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Director of the United States Mint Samuel Moore {{resigned}} his post, and Robert M. Patterson {{assumed the}} position. Shortly after, Patterson began {{an attempt to}} redesign the nation's coinage. After Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass suffered a stroke later that year, Christian Gobrecht was hired as an engraver. On August 1, Patterson {{wrote a letter to}} Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully laying out his plans for <b>the</b> <b>dollar</b> coin. He also asked Titian Peale to create a design for the coin. Sully created an obverse design depicting a seated representation of Liberty and Peale a reverse depicting a soaring bald eagle, which were converted into coin designs by Gobrecht. After the designs were created and trials struck, production of the working dies began in September 1836.|$|E

50|$|Prior to 1873, <b>the</b> Mexican <b>dollar</b> {{would have}} been to all intents and {{purposes}} equal in value to <b>the</b> silver <b>dollar</b> coins of <b>the</b> United States north of the border, but at that time in history, the Mexican coin would have had a much greater international notoriety than that of <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar.</b> <b>The</b> great silver devaluation of 1873 caused <b>the</b> Mexican <b>dollar</b> to drop in value against <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar,</b> but up until the beginning of the 20th century, <b>the</b> Mexican <b>dollar</b> would still have been a more widely accepted coin in the Far East, than <b>the</b> U.S. <b>dollar.</b> Between <b>the</b> 16th and 19th centuries, Mexico produced well over three billion of these coins.
