5|$|A {{ceremony}} at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 4 August 2004, marked the 90th anniversary of Britain's entry into the First World War. Allingham attended, together with three other First World War veterans, William Stone, Fred Lloyd and John Oborne. Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint-Omer on Armistice Day. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a First World War veteran marched past the Cenotaph and it {{marked the end of}} an era. No First World War veterans were present at the Cenotaph for the 2006 Remembrance Sunday Parade.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

25|$|Winnipeg Blue Bombers – Wore gold {{alternate}} jerseys as part {{of their}} 75th anniversary season in 2005. The jerseys were worn with either white pants or blue pants and were worn every season through to 2010. Additionally, for the three seasons that the Blue Bombers qualified for the playoffs, the gold jerseys were worn for each game, both home and away, and in the 95th Grey Cup. Also in 2010, the club wore retro 1970s era royal blue jerseys, which were then adopted as the alternates for 2011 and 2012. A modified 1980s era royal blue jersey was introduced in 2013 and was also worn in 2014. The Blue Bombers only wore their 2014 Signature series uniforms once, whereas all other teams wore theirs at least twice, possibly due to negative fan reception. To date, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that the club has worn a third jersey.|$|E
25|$|Against medical advice, Studd {{first visited}} the Belgian Congo in 1913 {{in the company}} of Alfred Buxton, and he {{established}} four mission stations in an area then inhabited by eight different tribes. Studd returned to England when Priscilla fell ill, but {{when he returned to the}} Congo in 1916 she had recovered sufficiently to undertake the expansion of the mission into the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade with workers in South America, Central Asia and the Middle East as well as Africa. Supported by his wife's work at home, Studd built up an extensive missionary outreach based on his centre at Ibambi in Budu territory. Priscilla made a short visit to the Congo in 1928. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> they met; she died the following year. Studd was joined in his work by his daughter Pauline and son-in-law Norman Grubb, and his grandson Noel Grubb, who died on his first birthday, is buried at Nala, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Studd's daughter Edith married Buxton.|$|E

500|$|Shirley {{replaced}} {{thousands of}} cymbal and drum hits with those used on previous recordings; the process took {{several days to}} complete. After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t like it, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> I played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya felt the same and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump {{at the beginning of}} the song got all over me. I couldn't hold my pick.

And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.'

500|$|Shortly after Lindesfarne had {{discovered}} her true origin as a human, Rudy's former schoolteacher Catherine Aura (a turkey buzzard) and her young son Nigel used an interdimensional portal {{to travel to}} [...] "our" [...] world permanently, taking both Lindesfarne's and Danielle's places there to restore the balance and cure the global instinct loss crisis that would otherwise have forced both of them {{to return to the}} world of humans permanently. Since the portal transforms travelers into a sapient species found in the destination world (which is how Lindesfarne became a hedgehog and Danielle a rabbit, though both were born humans in [...] "our" [...] world and had counterparts of those other species in the Kevin and Kell world), travelers from that world usually transform into humans, but Catherine and her son transformed into dolphins instead (indicating that dolphins are, in fact, sapient, and perhaps more so than humans). <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> they were seen in the webcomic strip.|$|E

2500|$|In the NFC Divisional Playoff game on January 13, 2007, Bush ran for 52 {{yards on}} 12 carries and scored a touchdown, and added three catches for 22 yards, as New Orleans edged the Philadelphia Eagles 27–24 to earn its first NFC Championship Game {{appearance}} in the team's 40-year history. The game was also notable for the vicious hit that Bush absorbed from Sheldon Brown while attempting to catch a swing pass on the Saints' first play of the game. On January 21, in the NFC Championship playoff game, Bush caught a pass on the 22 and ran 78 yards downfield (eluding the Chicago Bears safety) for an 88-yard touchdown thrown by Drew Brees.

2500|$|Although Ponce benefited {{early in}} his career from royal patronage, he was at first [...] "a fairly {{peripheral}} figure ... one among a large number of second-rate Leonese nobles who lacked the wealth and political clout of the great magnates of the realm." [...] During the first half of Alfonso VII's reign, Ponce was rarely in attendance at the curia regis (royal court), where noble attendees [...] "were expected to counsel the monarch in the day-to-day business of government." [...] The first record of Ponce at court dates to 25 March 1129, when the court was staying at Palencia and the king made a grant to the archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela, witnessed by Ponce among others. Although he was at court still, or again, on 8 July, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> before 23 March 1131, making his an absence of almost three years. During the decade of the 1130s his attendance at court was sporadic, marked by another three-year absence (28 May 1132 – 29 May 1135) and one of two years (2 October 1136 – 14 September 1138). In 1135 or 1136, he was in Catalonia again, signing a conventientia with his overlord and relative, Count Ermengol VI of Urgell.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 2007, Joe {{unexpectedly}} {{returns to}} the Fowlers' house, much to the horror of Pauline's friend Dot Branning (June Brown), who is inside {{the house at the}} time. Joe reveals to Dot that he had gone back to the house on Christmas Day to try to patch things up with Pauline, but that she harshly told him that he [...] was leaving, not her, and continued to insult him and his ways. He told Pauline he felt like lashing out at times, and she dared him to [...] "be a man" [...] and hit her. Joe then describes how, In an anger, he picked up a frying pan and hit Pauline hard on the head with it. He left the house after the incident, at which point Pauline was fine, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> he saw his wife, who later died due to a brain haemorrhage caused by the blow to the head Joe had given her. Dot then proceeds to try to convince Joe to tell the truth but he refuses. She then attempts to ring the police but Joe snatches the phone out of her hand and throws it away. Dot's husband, Jim (John Bardon) meanwhile, arrives at the Fowlers' house to find Dot. Seeing that Joe is holding Dot captive, Jim rushes over to save her and a struggle that follows results in Joe falling back and crashing out of a window and falling through a market stall.
