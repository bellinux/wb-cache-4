5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, a number of senior U.S. {{intelligence}} officials met {{with the leaders of}} <b>the</b> <b>KLA,</b> and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in Kosovo and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside Kosovo, not to continue participating in the drug trade, and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave Kosovo. Though few Kosovo Albanians sympathized with the Islamists, some argued that <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> should have accepted assistance from any source, fundamentalist or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered the mujahideen to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> ranks as what was to be done with them.|$|E
5|$|Within hours, {{suspected}} KLA gunmen {{attacked a}} Serb-owned café in Peć, killing six unarmed Serb youths. Western diplomats suspected {{the attack was}} carried out in retaliation for the ambush, though <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> denied responsibility. Several days later, Yugoslav authorities returned the bodies of all but three of the fallen militants following mediation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The militants were given heroes' funerals in a rebel-held area, in a ceremony attended by thousands of ethnic Albanians, including other KLA fighters. In January 1999, <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> abducted eight VJ personnel, who were later exchanged for the nine militants captured in the ambush.|$|E
5|$|The KLA's {{popularity}} skyrocketed {{after the}} VJ and MUP attacked the compound of KLA leader Adem Jashari in March 1998, killing him, his closest associates {{and most of}} his family. The attack motivated thousands of young Kosovo Albanians to join the ranks of <b>the</b> <b>KLA,</b> fueling the Kosovar uprising that eventually erupted in the spring of 1998.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>KLA's</b> {{first goal}} was thus to merge its Drenica stronghold with their stronghold in Albania proper, {{and this would}} shape {{the first few months}} of the fighting.|$|R

5|$|The Kosovo {{conflict}} escalated {{over the}} summer of 1998, and <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> increasingly took to smuggling weapons and supplies from Albania {{across the border into}} Kosovo. In September, Yugoslav officials stated that 90 militants had been killed while attempting to illegally cross the border since January of that year. The Yugoslav Defense Ministry reported that 947 rifles, 161 light machine guns, 33 mortars, 55 mines, 3,295 hand grenades, and almost 350,000 rounds of ammunition had been confiscated over the same period.|$|E
5|$|In October 1998, Milošević and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to temporarily end the fighting, whereby Yugoslavia would halve the amount of troops and police personnel stationed in Kosovo. The agreement came after Holbrooke convinced <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> to consider negotiations with Belgrade, while making it clear to Milošević that failing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict {{would lead to a}} NATO bombing campaign against Serbia. The agreement required Yugoslavia to let Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) observers enter Kosovo to ensure that the Yugoslavs were abiding by their commitment to withdraw thousands of soldier and police officers from the province. Small-scale clashes continued, and by December, over 1,000 people had been killed and more than 300,000 displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing <b>the</b> <b>KLA.</b> In response to the ambush, U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E

50|$|Agim Çeku, <b>the</b> <b>KLA's</b> {{military}} chief, became Prime Minister of Kosovo {{after the}} war. The move caused some controversy in Serbia, as Belgrade regarded {{him as a}} war criminal, though he was never indicted by the Hague tribunal.|$|R
5000|$|Gnjilane {{massacre}} - The {{remains of}} 80 Serbs were discovered {{after they were}} killed, allegedly by members of <b>the</b> <b>KLA's</b> Gnjilane Group, who were tried in absentia by a Serbian court and found guitly. A mass grave was found in Čena(r) Česma near Gnjilane.|$|R
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
25|$|After demilitarization of <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> {{following}} NATO's {{entry into}} Kosovo in 1999, <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> {{was transformed into}} the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC). In this new force, Haradinaj was appointed as a deputy commander, under Agim Çeku.|$|E
25|$|In some villages under Albanian {{control in}} 1998, militants drove ethnic-Serbs from their homes. Some {{of those who}} {{remained}} are unaccounted for and are presumed to have been abducted by <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> and killed. <b>The</b> <b>KLA</b> detained an estimated 85 Serbs during its 19 July 1998 attack on Orahovac. 35 of these were subsequently released but the others remained. On 22 July 1998, <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> briefly {{took control of the}} Belaćevac mine near the town of Obilić. Nine Serb mineworkers were captured that day and they remain on the International Committee of the Red Cross's list of the missing and are presumed to have been killed. In August 1998, 22 Serbian civilians were reportedly killed in the village of Klečka, where the police claimed to have discovered human remains and a kiln used to cremate the bodies. In September 1998, Serbian police collected 34 bodies of people believed to have been seized and murdered by <b>the</b> <b>KLA,</b> among them some ethnic Albanians, at Lake Radonjić near Glođane (Gllogjan) in {{what became known as the}} Lake Radonjić massacre.|$|E
50|$|Elton Zherka, Përmet Vula and Bashkim Lekaj fell on {{the same}} spot, a {{helpless}} Berisha was taken back to <b>the</b> <b>KLA's</b> makeshift headquarters {{in the center of}} Junik and died the same day as his friend Bedri Shala. Only days after his death, Junik fell {{into the hands of the}} Yugoslav authorities.|$|R
5000|$|By 1998 <b>the</b> <b>KLA’s</b> {{operations}} {{had evolved}} into a significant armed insurrection. According to {{the report of the}} USCRI, the [...] "Kosovo Liberation Army ... attacks aimed at trying to 'cleanse' Kosovo of its ethnic Serb population." [...] The UNHCR estimated the figure at 55,000 refugees who had fled to Montenegro and Central Serbia, most of whom were Kosovo Serbs.|$|R
50|$|By the {{conclusion}} of the pilot, the process' lack of stability renders it effectively useless for commercial or military applications, and <b>the</b> <b>Klae</b> Corporation is persuaded to re-employ him in his research capacity despite his condition, and thus the series begins from this point.

25|$|Mathews {{suggests}} {{the risk of}} nuclear terrorism remains unprevented. In 1999 during the Kosovo War, the U.S. supported the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a that was recognised as a terrorist organisation by the U.S. some years prior. Right before the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia took place, the U.S. took down <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> {{from the list of}} internationally recognized terrorist organizations in order to justify their aid and help to <b>the</b> <b>KLA.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some former KLA {{supporters}} {{had hoped}} to see Haradinaj enter a political alliance with Hashim Thaçi, the political leader of <b>the</b> <b>KLA.</b> By 2000 Thaçi led the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). They formed the chief opposition to the Ibrahim Rugova-led Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), which had been opposed to <b>the</b> <b>KLA.</b> Haradinaj said he had formed a new party {{to create a new}} paradigm for the future of democratic politics in Kosovo, to leave wartime divisions behind.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>KLA</b> {{seized the}} mine on 22 June, taking nine Serb mineworkers hostage, {{converting}} the mine into {{a base of}} operations and taunting the Yugoslav authorities by sending daylight patrols {{within sight of the}} provincial capital, Pristina. Over the next seven days, Yugoslav authorities and <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> negotiated over the fate of the mineworkers. Once negotiations broke down, the VJ and MUP attacked the mine and forced <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> out. Ten militants were killed in the clashes. The VJ and MUP reported suffering no casualties. Though the mine was recaptured, the hostages were nowhere to be found, and it is assumed they were killed by the militants. As of June 2014, the location of the mineworkers' remains is unknown. No one has ever been convicted of their deaths.|$|E

50|$|In 1990, Kosovo's {{autonomy}} within Yugoslavia was revoked. Soon after, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) {{was formed}} to fight the Yugoslav establishment. After a string of minor attacks, <b>the</b> <b>KLA's</b> mission became much more aggressive, which led to them claiming areas that were key to Serbia's fuel-supply, {{near the town of}} Orahovac. Years of ethnic tension had preceded the Kosovo War, and spilled into numerous atrocities on both sides.|$|R

25|$|Concurrent ground {{operations}} – <b>The</b> <b>KLA</b> undertook operations in Kosovo itself {{and had some}} successes against Serb forces. The Yugoslav army abandoned a border post opposite Morinë near the Yugoslav army outpost at Kosare in the north west of the province. The Yugoslav army outpost at Kosare remained in Yugoslav hands throughout the war: this allowed for a supply line {{to be set up}} into the province and the subsequent taking of territory in the Junik area. <b>The</b> <b>KLA</b> also penetrated a few miles into the south-western Mount Pastrik area. But most of the province remained under Serb control.|$|E
25|$|Haradinaj {{has five}} brothers. Two of them, Luan and Shkelzën, were killed {{as members of}} <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> during the fights with the Serbian {{security}} forces. In December 2002, Haradinaj's brother Daut was sentenced by a UN court in Kosovo for {{his involvement in the}} kidnapping and murder of four Kosovo Albanians, who belonged to the FARK, an armed formation of Kosovo Albanians and rivals of <b>the</b> <b>KLA,</b> to five years in prison. Enver Haradinaj, another brother of Ramush, was assassinated in April 2005 in a drive-by shootout in Kosovo. According to the UN security forces, there was a confrontation between rival Kosovo-Albanian clans. The youngest brother Frashër was still a student as of 2007 and worked {{in the service of the}} now former Provisional Institutions of Self-Government.|$|E

5000|$|Drenica is a hilly {{region in}} central Kosovo {{inhabited}} almost exclusively by ethnic Albanians. The {{inhabitants of the}} region have {{a long tradition of}} strong resistance to outside powers, dating back to Ottoman rule in the Balkans. The villages of the Drenica region are the birthplace of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which began armed operations in Drenica in 1996. By 1997, Kosovo Albanians had begun to refer to Drenica as [...] "liberated territory" [...] because of <b>the</b> <b>KLA's</b> presence.|$|R
25|$|Two days later, on 18 January, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Louise Arbour, {{attempted}} to enter Kosovo {{to investigate the}} killings but was refused access by Serbian authorities. On the same day, heavily armed Serbian police entered Račak under fire from <b>the</b> <b>KLA,</b> and removed the bodies, taking them to a morgue in Pristina to await a forensic examination.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 10 KLA militants. The Yugoslavs reported suffering no casualties. <b>The</b> <b>KLA</b> claimed two Kosovo Albanian civilians—an eight-year-old boy and a man—were killed in the clashes, and six injured. Yugoslav authorities confirmed that an eight-year-old boy had been killed in shelling near the town. By 1 July, the mine was reportedly back in operation. The same day, Western journalists attempting to enter Belaćevac were attacked by a mob of angry Serb civilians.|$|E
25|$|During the war Yugoslav strike {{aircraft}} J-22 Oraos and G-4 Super Galebs performed some 20–30 combat missions against <b>the</b> <b>KLA</b> in Kosovo at treetop level causing some casualties.

It was never firmly established whether an aircraft malfunction, pilot error or an enemy action (by KLA) was the cause (NATO never claimed it shot it down).|$|E
