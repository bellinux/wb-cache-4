5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators {{to determine whether a}} blip on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of three hydrocolloids (guar gum, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and locust bean gum (LBG)) and diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono-diglycerides (DATEM) on the rheological properties of hard wheat flour dough by using response surface methodology. Each independent variable was tested at five levels: guar gum, CMC and LBG were 0. 00 %, 50 %, 1. 00 %, 1. 50 % and 2. 0 % (w/w, on weight of flour basis), and DATEM was 0. 00 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 00 % (w/w, on weight of flour basis). The results showed that the guar gum was the most effective additive on water absorption values and the maximum resistance of the dough <b>to</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>out.</b> The best results among the combinations were generally obtained with CMC and DATEM on the maximum resistance of the dough <b>to</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>out...</b>|$|R
25|$|Although Yugoslavia {{joined the}} Axis powers, Fascist Italy demanded that their ally Nazi Germany invade Yugoslavia {{in order to}} reach Greece and help their {{disastrous}} campaign there and in the process break up Yugoslavia since Italians were laying claim on certain territories (mostly Dalmatia). The German Luftwaffe then began to mass at the borders of Yugoslavia from allied Axis nations. The VVKJ was forced <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> to defend Yugoslavia from an apparent invasion and imminent air war.|$|E
25|$|The Burmese {{battle plan}} was greatly shaped by their {{experience}} in the 1759–1760 war. First, they would avoid a single pronged attack route along the narrow Gulf of Siam coastline, which they discovered, could easily be clogged up by more numerous Siamese forces. In 1760, the Burmese were forced to spend nearly three months (January–March) to fight {{their way out of}} the coastline. This time, they planned a multi-pronged attack from all sides <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> the numerically superior Siamese defences.|$|E
25|$|The Workman layout {{employs a}} {{hypothesis}} about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, {{the index finger}} prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for the index finger, the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row. Contrarily, the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> rather than curl in. Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.|$|E

2500|$|This fact gives {{a general}} {{procedure}} for constructing any Frenet ribbon. [...] Intuitively, one can {{cut out a}} curved ribbon from a flat piece of paper. [...] Then by bending the ribbon out into space without tearing it, one produces a Frenet ribbon. [...] In the simple case of the slinky, the ribbon is several turns of an annulus in the plane, and bending it up into space corresponds <b>to</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>out</b> the slinky.|$|R
60|$|At last Maggot {{managed to}} touch the rock with the extreme point of his toe.

25|$|Vette's DC-10 was not {{carrying}} any instruments designed for search and rescue, {{so the two}} pilots were forced to get creative. The captain could roughly estimate Prochnow's position relative to his plane by comparing their relative headings when facing the sun and solar angles of elevation. Next, Vette began to triangulate the Cessna's location using the 200-mile range of its VHF radio. Vette also tried dumping 24,000 pounds of fuel from his own aircraft {{in the hope that}} Prochnow might be able to see it, but this proved to be unsuccessful. Prochnow and Vette then compared the time at which each of them observed the sun to set, and the addition of this new information finally made it possible for the Cessna's position to be calculated. After 23 hours of flying, and almost out of fuel—having used cruise control <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> the Cessna's usual 22 hours of fuel—Prochnow landed safely at Norfolk Island.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes are glial {{cells that}} are {{abundant}} in {{the central nervous system}}. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain. The glial scar that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and fibroblasts; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of cell processes <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple cell layers with complex 3D configurations.|$|E
25|$|The {{transponder}} {{problem had}} been growing before the introduction of AIS. IFF worked {{on the basis of}} a small receiver/transmitter set that listened for pulses from a radar and produced a low-power pulse broadcast on the same frequency but slightly delayed. The signal returned to the radar-equipped aircraft along with the original radar signal. When the two were amplified and displayed, the IFF signal caused the blip seen on the radar screen <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out.</b> The original 1.5m radar system had by this time been adapted to a wide range of roles including AI, ASV and acting as the basis for both the CHL and the new AMES Type 7 ground control interception radars. To avoid interference problems, each of these operated on slightly different frequencies, from about 180 to 210MHz. The Navy and Army added their own variations. The IFF Mk. II, originally designed to respond to the Mk. IV, had to be repeatedly modified to respond to new radar frequencies, and none of the many models were able to respond to all of these.|$|E

25|$|While most {{throws a}} first baseman must make {{go to the}} right, which a {{left-hander}} can generally accomplish with greater speed and fluency, this is a relatively small factor {{to the advantage of}} a left-handed first baseman. More important advantages are related to the position of a left-handed first baseman with respect to the base. First, a left-handed first baseman has an advantage over his right-handed counterpart when catching a pickoff throw from the pitcher—when a first baseman is in pickoff position, {{standing in front of the}} bag, the left-hander can catch the ball and make a tag without having to move his arm across his body. (See the picture in the Strategy over the course of the game section below for the standard pickoff position with a right-handed first baseman.) Second, because the first baseman starts most plays with his left leg closer to the base, the left-hander does not have to make a half-pivot to get into the correct position <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> for a throw. For these reasons, left-handed throwers are far more common at first base than in the general population of baseball players. In contrast, cricket is fielded in the round: the handedness of the fielder in any given position is of far less consequence due to the priority being placed on catching rather than throwing, coupled with the fact that the batsmen are running in opposite directions and both left-handed and right-handed throwers are found in all parts of the field.|$|E
500|$|According to Nyiszli, [...] "Eight {{hundred to}} a {{thousand}} people were crammed into the superimposed compartments of each barracks. Unable <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> completely, they slept there both lengthwise and crosswise, with one man's feet on another's head, neck, or chest. Stripped of all human dignity, they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other {{in an effort to}} get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep".|$|E

Lachman was hired, and New Found Power was formed in early 2003 with former Jerry Cantrell guitarist Shawn Matthews on bass initially, who was {{replaced}} after the album recording with the brothers' tattoo artist, Bob Zilla. When writing music, Vinnie claimed; [...] "we put no boundaries on it... we {{wanted it to be}} very diverse", and Darrell said [...] "We wanted <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> and expand our capabilities to their fullest."

500|$|Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton {{approached}} Depp and [...] "within 10 {{minutes of}} hearing about the project, I was committed," [...] the actor remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, {{it gave him a}} [...] "chance <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E
500|$|North of Ap Tan Thoi, three {{companies}} of the ARVN 11th Infantry Regiment fared no better. They marched south in three separate axes towards their objective. Again, well-concealed Viet Cong {{soldiers of the}} 514th Battalion allowed their opponents to come within [...] before opening fire. [...] Immediately, the South Vietnamese infantrymen were forced to hug the ground. During the next five hours, they managed to launch three major assaults, but failed to break the Viet Cong's line of defense. By 09:30, the last of Dam's reserve companies had been airlifted into Tan Hiep, about two hours late because American aircrews were prevented from landing their CH-21 helicopters, known as [...] "flying bananas" [...] for their shape, in the heavy fog that covered Tan Hiep Airfield most of the morning. With the ground attacks {{in the north and}} south bogged down, Dam decided <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> the defending Viet Cong units by attacking the east and the west.|$|E
500|$|... {{that was}} caught {{before the final}} climb to Sestriere. The first rider to launch a serious attack on the climb was Pedro Delgado, who was quickly {{followed}} by Chioccioli, Lejaretta, Eduardo Chozas, and Chiappucci, meanwhile Bugno was unable to follow their wheels. Chozas managed to win the stage as the group of four finish within four seconds of each other. With twenty kilometers {{to go in the}} fourteenth leg, Franco Ballerini, Casado, Juan Martínez Oliver, and Brian Peterson formed a breakaway group. The group managed <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> an advantage of almost two minutes as they entered the closing kilometers. Ballerini took the stage victory after he and Casado had managed to distance themselves slightly from the two other breakaway riders. LeMond abandoned the race following the conclusion of the fourteenth stage. The next day, on the ascent of the Mortirolo, race leader Chioccioli attacked and formed a solo attack. He rode the remaining fifty kilometers on his own to the stage victory, with his lead expanding to at most two minutes thirty seconds. He managed to put over a minute into each of his rivals.|$|E

500|$|... "Box Cutter", {{the fourth}} season premiere of Breaking Bad, was {{directed}} by Adam Bernstein and written by series creator Vince Gilligan. Filmed in January2011, the episode was edited by Skip MacDonald, {{one of a handful}} of editors who have regularly worked on the series. It was broadcast on July17,2011, and was the first original Breaking Bad episode in 13months, since the third season finale episode [...] "Full Measure" [...] aired in June 2010. AMC officials delayed the fourth-season premiere until July because they felt the Nielsen ratings would be better during the summer. While Breaking Bad scripts are generally 50pages long, the screenplay to [...] "Box Cutter" [...] was 43pages long, and Gilligan was originally concerned because he did not want <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> the episode simply to pad the running time. [...] "Full Measure" [...] ended with Jesse's pulling a gun on Gale and firing directly into the screen, with Gale's death not visibly revealed on-screen. This led to wide speculation among fans and reviewers that Jesse did not actually kill Gale, but rather aimed away from him and fired the gun. This speculation continued up until the original broadcast of [...] "Box Cutter", which confirmed Jesse indeed killed Gale. Gilligan said he never intended for that scene to be a cliffhanger and he thought it clearly conveyed that Gale had died.|$|E
500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Mom and Pop Art" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Giving it a positive review, Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com {{described it as}} [...] "one of the show's most gratifying eps". He wrote [...] "Amidst Homer's accidental acceptance as a producer of rage-filled outsider art, the episode concocts a knowing satire—but also warm appreciation—of modern art," [...] and added that it [...] "includes one of the show's best cameos of all time: a kleptomaniacal Jasper Johns." [...] Both James Plath of DVD Town and Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News considered it {{to be one of}} the season's best episodes. The A.V. Club named Milhouse's line [...] "Everything's coming up Milhouse!" [...] as one of the quotes from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations. Giving the episode a mixed review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson described it as [...] "pretty average." [...] He wrote that [...] "Mom and Pop Art" [...] "offer more than a few elements that echo bits from earlier years". He concluded by writing that the episode [...] "isn’t a bad program, but it lacks much inspiration". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide wrote, [...] "Well, Marge is justifiably upset when, as an artist herself, it is Homer who is suddenly getting the kudos for producing rubbish. It's a good gag but probably not enough <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> for an entire episode." [...] However, they added that the last scenes, along with Johns's cameo, were [...] "pure joy", even though the episode [...] "drag in the middle".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles {{considered}} the album [...] "an unexpected magnum opus", and while Pareles felt that [...] "the rock CD overpowers the acoustic one", he considered that [...] "among the quieter songs, {{there are enough}} supple melodies and hypnotic guitar patterns to suggest fine prospects for a follow-through album". Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly described the discs of In Your Honor as [...] "the outdoors and indoors sides", with the rockers [...] "pack an intoxicating wallop: 90-proof rock for 90-degree weather, they'll sound terrific blasting from convertibles, open windows, boom boxes, and at barbecues and beach parties" [...] and the acoustic songs [...] "all very pretty — sometimes scarily so", ultimately concluding that [...] "you'll probably revisit the rockin' half more often". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that the record [...] "showcases a reinvigorated band that is eager <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> and experiment", with the rock record having a [...] "fluid musicality and a [...] sense of drama that gives it a nearly cinematic sense of scope", and the acoustic album being [...] "quieter, {{but it also has}} a similar flow and easy grace that makes it a fitting complement to the harder first record." [...] Reviewer Joe Gross of Spin described the hard rock disc as [...] "the most consistent rockers of Grohl's career" [...] and considered that the album as a whole [...] "chronicle the physical and mental graffiti of figuring out how to emerge from some very large shadows, including his own, with nerve and power" [...] While Mike Schiller of PopMatters considered that [...] "In Your Honor has some great tunes, but {{it is by no means}} perfect", he praised the rock songs for [...] "indications of just how loud this band can get", and regarding the acoustic tracks, wrote that [...] "despite the down-tempo feel, the songs are infectious".|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, Eugene Chadbourne states [...] "This, the one {{existing}} album of this group, {{suffers from a}} syndrome of the time being too short <b>to</b> allow <b>stretching</b> <b>out</b> {{if it is to}} include a few different styles of compositions by each writing member of the group, which, in this case, included not only Smith but pianist Anthony Davis." ...|$|R
