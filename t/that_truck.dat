5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state <b>that</b> <b>truck</b> traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is {{informed}} by Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) that his former boss Ed Truck has died. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) and Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith) console Michael after he breaks the news to a mostly unmoved staff. [...] Later, Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) tells Michael <b>that</b> <b>Truck,</b> heavily inebriated, was decapitated in a truck accident. Michael summons the staff to a primitive grief counseling session involving a collapsible Hoberman sphere ball, in which Michael tells members of the staff to give stories of deceased love ones. This leads to the staff telling stories about losing loved ones based on death scenes in movies (Million Dollar Baby, The Lion King, and Weekend at Bernie's) with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) saying he would elaborate more on his story, {{but it would take}} {{about an hour and a}} half to do it.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{started on}} the project in May. One lane of traffic in each {{direction}} was maintained for US41/M-28. Motorist seeking access to downtown were detoured via Grove Street or Lakeshore Boulevard. The Downtown Development Authority had plans to purchase billboards helping to direct customers to the downtown shopping district. A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west. The lanes northbound into downtown were opened {{in the beginning of}} August, and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19, 2010. The remaining lanes were opened the next day. To address residents' concerns about truck traffic through the intersection, the mayor note <b>that</b> <b>truck</b> used the roundabout after the ribbon was cut. [...] "It just cruised right around and through. All of these people who are wondering is it big enough, can you get a firetruck on it? Yes, you can," [...] stated Mayor John Kivela.|$|E

In the same interview, he stated, [...] "Mr. Romanelli should go fuck himself."

2500|$|Sherwood's hard luck, unfortunately, did {{not stop}} there, and he was plagued with a {{frustrating}} amount of mechanical problems. For starters, he loses his battery box and batteries (resulting in two days lost while a replacement box is fabricated on the spot), suffers a flat tire, and then experiences problems with his truck’s on-board computer that forces him to abandon a load on the roadside. Sherwood ends up driving the truck of expelled driver Todd White just {{to pick up where}} he left off, yet ends up suffering through problems in <b>that</b> <b>truck,</b> as well (as seen in episode 7). [...] Hugh Rowland, the truck's owner, and Lee Parkinson, Rowland's mechanic, blamed many of these mechanical problems squarely on Sherwood. Sherwood ultimately decides enough is enough and leaves the ice roads to return home.|$|E
