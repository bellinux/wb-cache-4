5|$|On September 12, 1917, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} eighteenth {{biennial}} convention at the Bohemian Hall in Baltimore, Maryland. The welcome address {{was given by}} Maryland governor Emerson Harrington to 500 delegates. General Oden Lake also spoke at <b>this</b> <b>convention</b> and {{announced that he would}} not be running again as their national commander. The next day was scheduled a banquet reception and later in the week an old-time campfire event. Overall there were about 2000 visitors to <b>this</b> <b>convention.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by <b>this</b> <b>Convention</b> shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction for the purposes of <b>this</b> <b>Convention.</b> This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E
5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. <b>This</b> <b>convention</b> is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

5|$|Besides championing the Southern {{cause in}} Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky {{to bolster the}} state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a {{sovereignty}} convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to <b>this</b> <b>convention</b> chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Camp Burnett, a Confederate recruiting post two miles west of Clinton in Hickman County, Kentucky, was named after him.|$|E
5|$|By {{established}} practice, Byzantine emperors did {{not personally}} lead troops into battle. Heraclius ignored <b>this</b> <b>convention</b> and joined with his general Priscus' siege of the Persians at Caesarea. Priscus {{pretended to be}} ill, however, and {{did not meet the}} emperor. This was a veiled insult to Heraclius, who hid his dislike of Priscus and returned to Constantinople in 612. Meanwhile, Shahin's troops escaped Priscus' blockade and burned Caesarea, much to Heraclius' displeasure. Priscus was soon removed from command, along with others who served under Phocas. Philippicus, an old general of Maurice's, was appointed as commander-in-chief, but he proved himself incompetent against the Persians, avoiding engagements in battle. Heraclius then appointed himself commander along with his brother Theodore to finally solidify command of the army.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1861, both {{federal and}} Confederate troops entered Kentucky. Magoffin {{declared}} both sides equally guilty of violating Kentucky's neutrality {{and demanded that}} both sides withdraw. A resolution calling for immediate withdrawal by both Union and Confederate forces was defeated in the legislature. Instead, the legislature passed a resolution ordering only the Confederate troops out of the state. Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state. Despite his southern sympathies, Magoffin denounced the actions of <b>this</b> <b>convention.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took <b>this</b> <b>convention</b> much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 1915, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} seventeenth {{biennial}} convention in Washington, D.C.. The encampment was coordinated by General Oden Lake, their national commander. There were about 25,000 visitors during <b>this</b> <b>convention,</b> {{including members of}} the Army and Navy Union. There was a suite of rooms reserved at the New Willard Hotel for encampment headquarters from June 1 to September 30. A large parade was part of September convention, which involved all the veteran organizations of the Washington area garrisons. The program of events included a grand military ball and a banquet with high ranking government officials.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 1913, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} sixteenth {{biennial}} national encampment convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Some {{of the delegates}} took a river steamer trip {{the next day and}} went up the Delaware River from the Arch street wharf to Port Richmond. They were shown various piers and shipbuilding yards and stopped at League Island. Colonel H. Ogden Lake was presented as the next commander of the national organization, since Commander Downs retired from the position. There were about a thousand delegates that attended <b>this</b> <b>convention.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{sovereignty}} convention {{gathered at}} the William Forst House in Russellville as scheduled on November 18, 1861. Burnett also presided over <b>this</b> <b>convention.</b> Fearing {{for the safety of}} the delegates, he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8, 1862, but Scott County's George W. Johnson convinced the majority of the delegates to continue. By the third day, the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower on the campus of Bethel Female College, a now-defunct institution in Russellville.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that <b>this</b> <b>convention</b> only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones {{to attend}} a {{convention}} alongside Métis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to <b>this</b> <b>convention</b> a list of rights to be demanded {{as a condition of}} union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton area hosts several arenas and venues. South of Dayton in Kettering is the Fraze Pavilion, which hosts many {{nationally and}} internationally known musicians. Several notable {{performances}} have included the Backstreet Boys, Boston, and Steve Miller Band. South of downtown, {{on the banks of}} the Great Miami River, is the University of Dayton Arena, home venue for the University of Dayton Flyers basketball teams and the location of various other events and concerts. It also hosts the Winter Guard International championships, at which hundreds of percussion and color guard ensembles from around the world compete. North of Dayton is the Hara Arena, which frequently hosts expo events and concerts. In addition, the Dayton Amateur Radio Association hosts the annual Dayton Hamvention, North America's largest hamfest, at Hara Arena. Up to 25,000 amateur radio operators attend <b>this</b> <b>convention.</b> The Nutter Center, which is just east of Dayton in the suburb of Fairborn, is the home arena for athletics of Wright State University and the former Dayton Bombers hockey team. This venue is used for many concerts, community events, and various national traveling shows and performances.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{appointed}} Senator Murphy to the High Court, {{even though}} Murphy's Senate seat {{would not be}} up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Labor then held {{three of the five}} short-term New South Wales Senate seats. Under proportional representation, Labor could hold its three short-term seats in the next half-Senate election but, if Murphy's seat were also contested, Labor was unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, a Murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided Senate at the next election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis felt that <b>this</b> <b>convention</b> only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent. By March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as leader of the Opposition, and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives. Malcolm Fraser challenged Snedden for the leadership, and defeated him on 21 March.|$|E
