40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} prolong the life of steel worm pair used in track <b>tension</b> <b>adjuster,</b> a test method was {{designed}} to evaluate the effect of hardness on the fretting wear behavior of steel worm gear on a SRV oscillating friction and wear tester. Through this method the fretting wear behavior of 40 CrNiMoA steel- 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel with different hardness matching was studied under dry sliding condition at room temperature. The results show that in the steel worm gear pair composed of 40 CrNiMoA steel and 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel, the fretting wear volume loss of 40 CrNiMoA steel decreased {{and that of the}} 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel worm material increased with the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel increasing. When the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel is about HRC 49, fretting wear volumes of the worm specimen was equal to that of the worm wheel specimen. Based on the experimental results, reasonable hardness matching for prolonging the life of steel worm pair used in track <b>tension</b> <b>adjuster</b> was proposed...|$|R
50|$|In {{a common}} type of {{stuffing}} box, rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the stuffing box. A traditional variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of flax or hemp impregnated with wax and lubricants. A turn of the <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> compresses the shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just {{enough to make the}} seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when the shaft is turning. The drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat.|$|R

5000|$|A {{captured}} Type 97 mortar, {{which has}} been studied in detail, was marked [...] "Type 97 High-Angle Infantry Gun". The weapon was manufactured in 1942 in the Osaka Army Arsenal. Although the Japanese weapon closely resembles the US 81-mm mortar, M1, there are several identifying features by which the two can be distinguished. The <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> of the Japanese mortar {{is on the right}} bipod leg, while the sight is on the left. Other differences are the buttress-type threads on the traversing and elevating screws of the Japanese weapon, as well as the use of welding to fasten bipod legs to the clevis joint and grease fittings dissimilar to those used by the US model.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} make {{environmental}} test centrifuge balance automatically and accurately, reduce unbalance centrifugal force, balance adjusting system of centrifuge is designed. The new balance adjusting system comprises motor-reducer, timing belt, screw pair, slider-guideway and four rocker force sensors. According to information obtained by the four rocker force sensors, unbalanced value {{at both ends of}} the big arm is computed and heavy block is moved to achieve balance adjusting. In this paper, motor power and torque to move the heavy block is calculated. In full load running progress of centrifuge, the stress-strain of screw pair composed by <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> and big arm are analyzed. A successful application of the balance adjusting system is also put forwarded. The results show that the balance adjusting system can satisfy balance require of environmental test centrifuge.

5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{was of the}} Christie type, {{with long}} helical springs (in tension) angled back to keep the hull sides low. Of the five road wheels each side, four had shock absorbers. The tracks were driven by sprocketed wheels at the rear and <b>tension</b> <b>adjusted</b> at the front idler, this being standard British practice. Some variants were produced with 14 in tracks; later, 15.5-inch tracks were used. As with previous Christie-suspension cruiser tanks, there were no track return rollers, the track being supported instead {{on the tops of}} the road wheels, known as the [...] "slack-track" [...] design. The side of the hull was made up of two spaced plates, the suspension units between them, and the outer plate having cutouts for the movement of the road-wheel axles.|$|R
50|$|The Type 97 is {{approximately}} 120 lb {{lighter than the}} Type 94 90-mm mortar. This weight saving was created largely by {{the elimination of the}} Type 94's recoil mechanism, which weighed 110 lb. The bipod assembly of the Type 97 is 14 lb lighter than that on the Type 94. There is a cover for the level on the yoke of the Type 97 which is not on the Type 94, and the sliding bracket of the Type 97 is hinged to permit its easy removal from the leg of the bipod, whereas it is integral on the Type 94.Certain compromises in material and workmanship were made in the manufacture of the Type 97. The bipod feet and chain hooks were held to the legs of the bipod by pins, joined with solder, whereas on the Type 94 they are welded. No welds were polished on the Type 97, although no indications of fractures were reported despite the poor quality of the welding. The <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut,</b> sliding bracket, and hand wheels of the Type 97 are made of steel, rather than brass which was utilized in the Type 94.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The tendon {{transfer}} operation {{is the most}} preferred surgical method for chronic extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon rupture repair. The key factor in these operations is tension setting of the tendon transfer. In this article, we retrospectively reviewed our extensor indicis proprius (EIP) to EPL transfer cases for chronic EPL ruptures. Methods: Five patients were operated on for chronic rupture of the EPL tendon between December of 2011 and April of 2014. The EIP tendon {{was transferred to the}} EPL tendon using the wide-awake approach in order to optimally set the tension. Results: All five patients were able to extend their thumbs. No second operation was needed for <b>tension</b> <b>adjusting.</b> No complications were encountered postoperatively and during the follow-up period. Conclusion: Tendon transfers using the wide-awake approach provides the benefit of improved tendon tension setting with active movement and minimal risks of complication.

5000|$|The {{pressure}} of the breathing gas supply to a surface supplied diver is set at the gas panel, and does not automatically compensate for small depth changes the way most open circuit scuba first stages operate. To compensate for small variations due to moving around the workplace and variations in posture, the surface supplied demand helmet or full-face mask may be provided with a second stage valve spring <b>tension</b> <b>adjuster</b> screw, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "dial-a-breath", which allows the diver to make adjustments to compensate for these variations. The knob can usually control cracking pressure from free-flow through to quite hard to breathe, and will usually compensate adequately for depth variations in the order of tens of metres. This skill is also well practiced by most divers, and is used on most dives. The knob is usually first adjusted during the pre-dive checks, and after that whenever the diver feels the need.|$|R

50|$|The {{differences}} between the Type 99 and the US 81-mm mortar, M1 are more pronounced. The tube length of the Japanese weapon is only about half that of the US mortar 59.5 inches vs 25.5 inches. Of much greater significance, however, is {{the difference in the}} method of firing. Whereas the Type 97 has a fixed firing pin in the base cap, the Type 99 has its firing pin affixed to a camshaft that extends outside the base cap of the mortar. This shaft must be struck a sharp blow with a mallet to drive it inward so as to force the firing pin against the primer of the propellant cartridge. The primer ignites the propellant charge of the cartridge, which in turn ignites the powder increments attached to the fins. The weapon fires with an exceptionally loud report and a pronounced muzzle flash. When the firing pin camshaft is struck, the camshaft spring is extended. When it snaps back into its original shape, it withdraws the camshaft thus bringing the firing pin down into the base cap in position for the next shot. In addition to the different methods of firing, the Japanese weapon also employs a turnbuckle for cross-leveling instead of an <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> and connecting rod, and its recoil mechanism also differs from that of the US piece. Finally, the Japanese base plate has only one socket for the base cap knob, and it is not provided with a sighting line.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} ways {{to change the}} pitch of a {{vibrating}} string. String instruments are tuned by varying the strings' <b>tension</b> because <b>adjusting</b> length or mass per unit length is impractical. Instruments with a fingerboard are then played by adjusting {{the length of the}} vibrating portion of the strings. The following observations all apply to a string that is infinitely flexible (a theoretical assumption, because in practical applications, strings are not infinitely flexible) strung between two fixed supports. Real strings have finite curvature at the bridge and nut, and the bridge, because of its motion, are not exactly nodes of vibration. Hence the following statements about proportionality are approximations.|$|R

Fractographic analysis in both fracture surfaces indicated a ductile-brittle mixed fracture mode. Original pin surface exhibited a granular appearance while substitute pin surface showed fibrous and rough morphology. Precipitation of nearly rounded, elliptical and elongate second – phase particles containing Cr, C and Mn measured as intergranular and transgranular particle density was observed, promoting some brittle failure zones and ductile fracture measured as the volume fraction of grain boundaries and microvoids, respectively. A larger amount of intergranular medium precipitates was found on the original pin which favored the brittle failure among the grain boundaries compared to that of the substitute pin.
