5|$|Prior to {{this move}} to <b>the</b> <b>Vanilla</b> Studios {{rehearsal}} space, the Clash's songwriters Mick Jones and Joe Strummer {{had experienced a}} period of writer's block. They had not written a new song from scratch in over a year, with the material on their recently released Cost of Living EP, composed of a cover song and three songs that had all been written over twelve months earlier. The Clash arrived at Vanilla in May 1979 without a single new song prepared for their third album.|$|E

5|$|Although he was successful, Ice later regretted his {{business}} arrangements with SBK, which had paid him {{to adopt a}} more commercial appearance {{to appeal to a}} mass audience and published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. After surviving a suicide attempt, Ice was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. While his later, less mainstream albums failed to chart or receive much radio airplay, Ice has had a loyal underground following. In 2009, Ice began hosting <b>The</b> <b>Vanilla</b> Ice Project on DIY Network. His latest album WTF – Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus was released in August 2011.

25|$|Vanillin is a {{phenolic}} aldehyde, {{which is}} an organic compound with the molecular formula C8H8O3. Its functional groups include aldehyde, hydroxyl, and ether. It is the primary component of the extract of <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> bean. Synthetic vanillin is now used more often than natural vanilla extract as a flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|Vanillin is a {{phenolic}} aldehyde {{most commonly}} associated with <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> notes in wines that have been aged in oak. Trace amounts of vanillin are found naturally in grapes, but they are most prominent in the lignin structure of oak barrels. Newer barrels will impart more vanillin, with the concentration present decreasing with each subsequent usage.|$|E

25|$|Cyclones have precipitated illegal {{rosewood}} {{logging in}} other ways. When Cyclone Hudah hit {{the island in}} April 2000, affecting 50,000 people, it exacerbated local poverty. Its devastating effects, later coupled with the downturn in <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> market, drove the local people to increase their slash and burn agriculture (called tavy), the use of bushmeat, and the logging of precious hardwoods.|$|E
25|$|Reverse {{convertibles}} are a {{less common}} variation, mostly issued synthetically. They would be opposite of <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> structure: the conversion price {{would act as}} a knock-in short call option: as the stock price drops below the conversion price the investor would start to be exposed the underlying stock performance and {{no longer able to}} redeem at par its bond.

25|$|Impacting Tonga twice {{within the}} span of a few days, Winston caused {{significant}} damage across northern Tonga. Approximately 2,500people sought refuge in shelters. The first passage of the storm resulted in mostly crop damage while the second brought greater structural damage. At least 10homes were destroyed and 200 more were damaged. Agriculture sustained significant damage, with 85–95percent of the banana crop and most of <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> crop on Vava'u lost. Winston also affected Niue on 16 February; the FMS also issued tropical cyclone and damaging heavy swell warnings for the island nation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major group}} was the Totonacs, who have survived {{to the present}} day. Their region, called Totonacapan, is {{centered}} between the Cazones River and the Papaloapan River {{in the north of}} the state. Pre-Columbian Totonacs lived from hunting, fishing and agriculture, mostly of corn, beans, chili peppers and squash. This is also the native region of <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> bean. Clay sculptures with smiling faces are indicative of this culture. The major site is El Tajín, located near Papantla, but the culture reached its apogee in Cempoala (about five miles (8km) inland from the current port of Veracruz), when it was conquered by the Aztecs. When the Spaniards arrived in 1519, the territory was still home to a population of about 250,000 people living in fifty population centers and speaking four Totonac dialects. 25,000 were living in Cempoala alone.|$|E
25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips {{have the benefit of}} imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of weeks}} while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E

500|$|Catastrophic {{agricultural}} damage occurred {{across the}} island, with losses reaching an estimated €76 million (US$66.7 million). The entire {{fruit and vegetable}} crop was lost during the storm while <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> and geranium crops sustained heavy damage. Additionally, about 15 – 20 percent of the sugarcane crop was destroyed. Horticulture sustained about 50 percent losses; however, much of this resulted from lost work hours. Poultry farms suffered about 70 percent losses, from lost animals and destroyed buildings. Along the coast, large waves measured up to [...] caused moderate damage. Additionally, an estimated storm surge of [...] impacted the island. Some buildings were flooded, roads washed out, and other roads were left covered in debris.|$|E

500|$|Vanilla {{was first}} {{introduced}} to French Polynesia by French colonizers as an export crop. Later, it became an important cash crop {{in the development of}} the island's economy. In the early 20th century, production was much greater than it is today, with 150-200 tons produced annually and plantations employing a sizable percentage of the population. Over the years, its production has been influenced by several factors and has declined from a high of 200 tons to a 2013 yield of 60 tons. The largest concentration of <b>the</b> <b>vanilla</b> variety Vanilla tahitensis (Tahitian vanilla) is situated in the Society Islands. The island of Taha'a, known as the [...] "Vanilla Island" [...] because of its pervasive aroma of vanilla, produces about 80% of all French Polynesia's vanilla.|$|E
500|$|Once Angband was {{released}} to the public via USENET, there were efforts to have code maintainers (the [...] "devteam") to fix bugs, clean up the code and implement suggestions into the code. Due to numerous shifts in those maintaining the code (due to other obligations), and the number of potential user suggestions to include, Angband would become highly forked, leading to a number of Angband variants; at least sixty known variants exist with about a half dozen still under active development. One significant fork was ZAngband (1994) (short for Zelazny Angband), which expanded on Angband and altered the theme towards Roger Zelazny's The Chronicles of Amber. The ZAngband codebase would be used to create Tales of Middle Earth (TOME) in 2002, which later swapped out the Tolkien and Zelazny fiction setting for a new original one to become Tales of Maj'Eyal (2009). <b>The</b> <b>vanilla</b> Angband remains in development today by the devteam.|$|E
