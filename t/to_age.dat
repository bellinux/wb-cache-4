40|$|This thesis {{portfolio}} examines attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> {{in older}} adults, and explores {{the impact that}} attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> have on mental health status and quality of life. Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> are becoming more widely measured in older adults, particularly {{with the ageing population}} but also due the recent development of the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Ageing</b> Questionnaire. There is growing evidence to suggest a relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and mental health status in older adults. However, no study has explored the association between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life in older adults, incorporating the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Ageing</b> Questionnaire and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life measures. Firstly a systematic search of studies exploring the relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and mental health in older adults (≥ 55 years) was undertaken. All potentially relevant studies were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Variables related <b>to</b> attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing,</b> ageism, age stereotypes, depression and anxiety were considered in this review. Twelve papers met inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The setting, culture and measures incorporated varied across the studies. A negative attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was associated with poorer mental health status in older adults across all 12 studies. The second part of this portfolio was an international cross-sectional analysis of attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life in older adults (≥ 57 years). Correlation and regression analyses explored the relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and QOL and investigated the impact of socio-demographic variables, depression and attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> on two quality of life measures. The two constructs were positively related; a more positive attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was associated with a better quality of life. Further, positive attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} a better QOL. The sample was then divided into two age groups (57 - 79 years and 80 + years) and attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life ratings were compared. Results revealed more negative ratings in attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life in the over 80 year old age group. Correlation and regression analyses were then explored across both age groups. More positive attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was a significant predictor of better quality of life across both age groups. Overall, the two studies in this thesis portfolio highlight the need to better recognise and target older adults’ negative attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> Appropriate psychological interventions could be provided to challenge negative attitudes and promote attitude change in an attempt to improve mental health difficulties and quality of life in older adults. Continued use of the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Ageing</b> Questionnaire and quality of life psychometric measures in clinical practice and research is encouraged...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> {{have been}} {{investigated}} in non-carer populations and found to have important relationships with physical and mental health. However, these have not been explored in an older carer sample, although {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to clarify variables which are linked with positive carer outcomes. This {{is one of the first}} studies to report on older carers, their attitudes <b>to</b> <b>aging,</b> and the relationship with carer-related factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 202 carers with a mean age of 70. 8 years was conducted in Victoria, Australia, using carer demographic data, carer factors such as depression (using the Geriatric Depression Scale), burden (using the Zarit Burden Inventory, ZBI), physical health, personality, and attitudes <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> (using the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Aging</b> Questionnaire, AAQ). Spearman rank correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were used. RESULTS: This study showed that carers had overall positive attitudes <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> inspite of their caring role. It also identified that carer factors including depression and burden contributed a significant amount of the variance <b>to</b> attitudes <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> in terms of physical change and psychosocial loss. Personality traits, specifically neuroticism, and extraversion, were also important contributors <b>to</b> attitudes <b>to</b> <b>aging.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study demonstrated that inspite of moderate levels of depression and spending significant time caring, carers reported positive attitudes <b>to</b> <b>aging.</b> Treating depression, decreasing burden, and investigating the benefits of caring may assist older carers maintain their well-being...|$|R
40|$|To explore older adults’ {{perceptions}} of subjective <b>age</b> and adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and <b>to</b> analyse the correlational {{structure of the}} pre-categories in our study: subjective age, indicators of adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and of personal age perception. An exploratory, descriptive mixed-methods design was utilised. A purposive sampling method was used to select 154 older adults aged between 75 and 99 years from three different nationalities. Semi-structured interviews were performed, addressing two core areas: subjective <b>age</b> and adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> Data was subjected to content analysis. Representation of the correlational structure of the precategories in our study (subjective age and indicators of adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing)</b> were analysed by a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Standardised instruments measured regular cognitive abilities. Five categories derived from interviews for subjective age: ‘adapted’, ‘disconnected’, ‘old’, ‘youthful’ and ‘tolerant’. A total of seven categories emerged as indicators of adjustment to ageing: ‘social networking’, ‘health’, ‘time perspective’, ‘spirituality’, ‘financial autonomy’, ‘professional activities’ and ‘fulfilment and leisure’. These results supported a model for each pre-category. Subjective age was explained by a two-factor model: ‘age-conscientious’ and ‘youthful’. A three-dimensional model formed by ‘reconciled’, ‘satisficers’ and ‘maximisers’ was indicated as a best-fit solution for adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> A three-dimensional overall model for PAP was formed by ‘age-cognisant’, ‘fulfilled’ and ‘satisficers’. The findings highlighted the underdeveloped potential of subjective <b>age,</b> adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and a personal age perception overall model for this population. Enhancing subjective <b>age</b> and adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> might be an important target to improve older adults’ interventions’ outcomes...|$|R

Results: Staff training in each of 10 health conditions and 7 health procedures was positively associated with increased confidence in supporting residents with those health issues. Higher staff confidence in caring for residents with 9 conditions and requiring 4 procedures was negatively associated with a likelihood of recommending that a person with those health needs should relocate <b>to</b> <b>aged</b> care.

5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability <b>to</b> <b>age</b> and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability <b>to</b> <b>age,</b> some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{older people}} with more {{negative}} attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> are {{at increased risk}} of several adverse outcomes, including decline in physical function and increased difficulties with activities of daily living. Objective: we investigated whether negative attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> increase the risk of the onset or progression of frailty. Method: participants were 3, 505 men and women aged 60 years and over from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. They completed a 12 -item questionnaire on attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the structure of these items, and a single factor was derived which we labelled “physical and psychological loss. ” Frailty was assessed by the Fried phenotype of physical frailty at waves 2 and 4, and by a frailty index at waves 2 - 5. Results: having a more positive attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> as regards “physical and psychological loss” was associated with a decreased risk of becoming physically frail or pre-frail at follow-up. For a standard deviation increment in score, the relative risk ratios (95 % confidence interval), adjusted for age, sex and baseline level of physical frailty, were 0. 86 (0. 79, 0. 94) for pre-frailty and 0. 72 (0. 63, 0. 83) for frailty. Further adjustment for other potential confounding variables had only slight attenuating effects on these associations: multivariable-adjusted relative risk ratios were 0. 89 (0. 81, 0. 98) for pre-frailty and 0. 78 (0. 68, 0. 91) for frailty. Attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was not associated with change in the frailty index over time after adjustment for potential confounding variables. Conclusion: older people who have a more positive attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> are at reduced risk of becoming physically frail or pre-frail. Future research needs to replicate this finding and discover the underlying mechanisms. Attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was not a risk factor for change in the more broadly defined frailty index...|$|R
