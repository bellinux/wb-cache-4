5|$|When King {{bought the}} {{painting}} {{it consisted of}} 13 panels sewn together and rolled into one piece. To more easily store and transport the painting King unstitched the 13 panels and stored them individually together with two separate panels of scenery {{used to make the}} painting a bit longer depending on the exhibition space. The 13 panels along with the two extra scenery panels bring <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> 410 feet long according to King. The painting has, for the most part, remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996. The university sold the painting in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh, North Carolina, investors. The painting has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but the value of the sale remains unknown. The group intends to resell <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in {{the lower half of}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
5|$|During 1983–1984, the {{painting}} was exhibited at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, {{the painting}} should be moved there too.|$|E

5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E
5|$|In the centre, {{the women}} dance.

5|$|Jovanović {{composed}} the first, and most famous, {{version of the}} The Wounded Montenegrin in 1882 while studying at the Vienna Academy. It was sold to a merchant named Schwartz in Vienna later that year. Within several months, Schwartz sold <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> a Budapest casino for 1,000 florins. After World War II, it came into the possession of the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, which gifted it to the Matica Srpska gallery in 1971, where it is on permanent display.

5|$|Matejko {{began work}} on the {{painting}} {{in the middle of}} January 1891, to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution. Although the painting was not finished until October, by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Sukiennice, Kraków. On April 7, 1892, Matejko transferred <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko, marshal of Galician Sejm in Lwów, and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of the Lviv University). This painting {{was one of the last}} works by Matejko, who died in November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had had time to present their own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} his enthusiasm for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the painting, a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
5|$|Another {{work from}} this time is The Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} due {{to a change in}} the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening dress with a hat and a large feather. Knight sent <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E

5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie bring <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> {{city hall}} {{the next day}} to be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses {{disappointment}} that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be {{his best}} work, insisting that it form the centrepiece of his 1849 Royal Society of Arts solo exhibition. The Royal Manchester Institution {{was concerned that}} the painting would be damaged if moved, refusing {{to allow it to}} be used in the exhibition until Etty, and a number of influential friends, visited Manchester to beg them to release it. Etty died later that year, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. As it was rarely exhibited, The Sirens and Ulysses had little influence on later artists, although it is credited as an influence on Frederic Leighton's 1858 The Fisherman and the Syren.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E

50|$|First, {{the skin}} is prepped in a salt water solution. The {{subjects}} are instructed to let the salt water dry completely on the skin. This salt water simultaneously texturizes and adds an absorbent coating on the skin <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> adhere. Lotions and other moisturizers are recommended to be removed, as they prevent the salt from absorbing <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> properly. Drying <b>the</b> salt water takes about {{as much time as}} it takes water to air dry. Often, fans are installed at <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> site <b>to</b> allow for more practical drying times.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{behind the}} church is Tre Kronor castle. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and {{subsequently}} replaced by the Stockholm Palace, it was named after the central citadel, a large gun tower emblazoned with the Three Crowns symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown. While {{it is not known}} when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century. Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to Lübeck, expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed. In <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> the right of the church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction, the exposed roof trusses confirming the inconvenience experienced by the monarch.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the {{painting}} was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was displayed {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The painting was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be shown. The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The painting was restored in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club {{at the suggestion of}} chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E
