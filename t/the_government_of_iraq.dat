5|$|MEF {{commander}} Major General Richard Zilmer {{responded to}} press queries about {{the statement that}} Anbar Province was lost. Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, but added that his mission was only to train Iraqi security forces. He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E

Yousef is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a senior al-Qaeda member.

25|$|Tucson {{left for}} her first {{deployment}} ever, to the Western Pacific Ocean, in February 1998. At that time, tensions between the United Nations and Iraq had escalated drastically. In the 30 {{days leading up to}} departure, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> had blocked access to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and had withdrawn cooperation with the UNSCOM monitoring teams. The ship traveled as far west as the Persian Gulf before returning to Pearl Harbor in August 1998. It was during this period of time that the PBS series Nova filmed the episode “Battlegroups” aboard Tucson.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Petraeus's {{tenure in}} Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq {{endeavored}} {{to work with}} <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> {{to carry out this}} strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing—and maintaining—persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, the MEK killed US {{military}} personnel and US civilians working on defense projects in Tehran and supported the takeover in 1979 of the US Embassy in Tehran. In 1981, the MEK detonated bombs in the head office of the Islamic Republic Party and the Premier’s office, killing some 70 high-ranking Iranian officials, including Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti, President Mohammad-Ali Rajai, and Premier Mohammad-Javad Bahonar. Near {{the end of the}} 1980–1988 war with Iran, Baghdad armed the MEK with military equipment and sent it into action against Iranian forces. In 1991, the MEK assisted <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> in suppressing the Shia and Kurdish uprisings in southern Iraq and the Kurdish uprisings in the north.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{autonomy}} {{had originally}} been established in 1970 {{with the creation of}} the Kurdish Autonomous Region following the agreement of an Autonomy Accord between <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and leaders of the Iraqi Kurdish community. A Legislative Assembly was established and Erbil became the capital of the new entity which lay in Northern Iraq, encompassing the Kurdish authorities of Erbil, Dahuk and Sulaymaniyah. The one-party rule which had dominated Iraq however meant that the new assembly was an overall component of Baghdad's central government; the Kurdish authority was installed by Baghdad and no multi-party system had been inaugurated in Iraqi Kurdistan, and as such the local population enjoyed no particular democratic freedom denied {{to the rest of the}} country.|$|E

50|$|Accountability for all {{serious or}} gross {{violations}} of {{international human rights}} law and international humanitarian law is essential to ensure justice, provide redress to the victims and prevent future infringements. <b>The</b> <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Syrian Arab Republic {{have the responsibility to}} protect the individuals under their jurisdiction and ensuring justice and accountability in acts of grave crimes. Domestic courts in Iraq and Syrian Arab Republic have jurisdiction over all violations committed within their territories whether by nationals or foreigners. However, as there have been concerns regarding the judicial systems in both Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the involvement of the International Criminal Court. Its main purpose for intervention would be to investigate and prosecute the crimes allegedly committed by ISIL. As neither Iraq nor the Syrian Arab Republic are parties to the Rome Statute, the Court has no territorial jurisdiction over the crimes committed in their territory. In the Special Rapporteur report in 2015, the Special Rapporteur called on <b>the</b> <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and <b>the</b> Syrian Arab Republic to become parties without delay to the Rome Statute and to accept the jurisdiction of the Court over the current situation under article 12 (3).|$|R
25|$|In general, we {{absolutely}} condemn {{acts of violence}} and human rights violations committed against individuals in Iraq because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This {{is an issue that}} we've been following very closely since we have been made aware of these allegations, and we are aware of the allegations. Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
25|$|Events in Greece {{provoked}} a pro-Axis faction {{to take over}} <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Wavell, hard pressed on his other fronts, was unwilling to divert precious resources to Iraq and so it fell to Claude Auchinleck's India Command to send troops to Basra. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, saw Iraq as vital to Britain's strategic interests and in early May, under heavy pressure from London, Wavell agreed to send a division-sized force across the desert from Palestine to relieve the besieged British air base at Habbaniya and to assume overall control of troops in Iraq. By the end of May Quinan's forces in Iraq had captured Baghdad and the Anglo-Iraqi War had ended with troops in Iraq once more reverting to the overall control of GHQ in Delhi. However, Churchill had been unimpressed by Wavell's reluctance to act.|$|E

500|$|As the Americans withdrew, many Iraqis and Americans {{questioned}} {{the ability of}} the Iraqi security forces, especially the police, to protect the province. Others expressed skepticism over whether Iran would dominate Iraq and whether the Iraqi government would be able to provide security. One angry Iraqi described the American legacy as [...] "total destruction... you just came in, destroyed, and left." [...] Discussing the American withdrawal, a journalist in Fallujah predicted that <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> would continue to have trouble with Anbar Province, saying, [...] "Anbar was where instability began in Iraq.

Frederick Kagan, one of the [...] "intellectual architects" [...] of the Surge, referred to the visit as the [...] "Gettysburg" [...] of the Iraq War and observed that Bush thought Anbar was [...] "safe enough for the war cabinet of the United States of America to meet there with the senior leadership of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> to discuss strategy." ...|$|E
500|$|During this time, one of Colonel MacFarland's subordinates, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Deane, {{had kept}} {{contact with a}} {{low-level}} sheikh from the Abu Risha tribe, Abdul Sattar Abu Risha. In 2004 and 2005, Sattar's father and three of his brothers {{had been killed by}} AQI, but he had refused exile. In early September, Sattar told Deane that his tribe and several others were planning to ally with the United States and throw out the Baghdad-based government. Dean informed Colonel MacFarland, who pledged to support Sattar as long as Sattar continued to back <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> On 9 September, Sattar and former Anbar Governor Fasal al Gaood, along with 50 other sheikhs, announced the formation of the Anbar Awakening movement. Shortly after the meeting, Colonel MacFarland began hearing reports that off-duty Iraqi police operating as the military wing of the Awakening had formed a shadowy vigilante organization called [...] "Thuwar al-Anbar". Thuwar al-Anbar conducted terror attacks against known AQI operatives, while Colonel MacFarland and his soldiers turned a blind eye.|$|E
