500|$|Glenn was {{an ordained}} elder of the Presbyterian Church. His {{religious}} faith began {{before he became}} an astronaut, and was reinforced after he traveled in space. [...] "To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible," [...] said Glenn after his second (and final) space voyage. He saw no contradiction between belief in God and the knowledge that evolution is [...] "a fact" [...] and believed [...] evolution should be taught in schools: [...] "I don't see that I'm any less religious that I can {{appreciate the fact that}} science just records that we change with evolution and time, and that's a fact. It doesn't mean it's less wondrous and it doesn't mean that there can't be some power greater <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that has been behind and is behind whatever is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{also ran}} an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member, {{and led the}} group on a diving trip to the Bahamas. In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979 (eight years after Reinboldt's high school {{graduation}} in 1971), her brother {{had told her that}} he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. [...] Jolene said that Hastert [...] "damaged Steve I think more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will ever know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Handel has {{generally}} been accorded high esteem by fellow composers, both {{in his own time}} and since. Bach attempted, unsuccessfully, to meet Handel while he was visiting Halle. Mozart is reputed to have said of him, [...] "Handel understands affect better <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> When he chooses, he strikes like a thunder bolt." [...] To Beethoven he was [...] "the master of us all... the greatest composer that ever lived. I would uncover my head and kneel before his tomb." [...] Beethoven emphasised above all the simplicity and popular appeal of Handel's music when he said, [...] "Go to him to learn how to achieve great effects, by such simple means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is more, my lord, <b>than</b> we <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{can be sure}} of," [...] said Mr. Slope; [...] "I cannot, however, force Mrs. Proudie {{to leave}} the room; nor can I refuse to remain here if it be your lordship's wish that I should do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{concerned}} tone forced Felix to add, 'It came so {{much more}} heavily on her <b>than</b> on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> care and work and years of seeing my father's health failing; {{and in the last}} week of his life she had a fall, that brought on softening of the brain.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That we should," [...] Harris said warmly. [...] "We {{were all}} good friends before, but nothing {{to what we}} are now after living so long together, {{roughing}} it and sharing each others' dangers. For my part I would rather go without <b>any</b> more fighting <b>than</b> that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> should go down." ...|$|R
2500|$|After the race, her coach Dave Scott told {{journalist}} T J Murphy that Wellington was [...] "traumatised" [...] by {{the effects}} of her injuries, and that despite her [...] "stoic" [...] attitude, her injuries were [...] "worse <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> might have imagined", adding, [...] "I don't think Chrissie will appreciate me telling you this, but it's important." [...] Murphy described her performance as [...] "inspirational", but added, [...] "it was more than that. It was chilling. [...] It was chilling to watch because you could see Wellington racing her way right to the hospital, paying literally no heed to her brain's internal governor – {{one that has been}} wired into the human body through millions of years of evolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{contributions}} to the genre have been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Cash received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1996 and stated that his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980 was his greatest professional achievement. In 2001, {{he was awarded the}} National Medal of Arts. [...] "Hurt" [...] was nominated for six VMAs at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The only VMA the video won was that for Best Cinematography. With the video, Johnny Cash became the oldest artist ever nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. Justin Timberlake, who won Best Video that year for [...] "Cry Me a River," [...] said in his acceptance speech: [...] "This is a travesty! I demand a recount. My grandfather raised me on Johnny Cash, and I think he deserves this more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in here tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved {{to know what was going}} on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> by not coming back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rachel, [...] "may {{she never}} {{be out of}} your influence, or be left to untrustworthy hands. I should have been much better if I had had either father or brother to keep me in order. Poor child, she has a {{wonderful}} charm, not all my fancy, Alick. And yet there is one whose real working talent has been more <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> who has made it effective for herself and others, and has let it do her only good, not harm." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} that Hiram had given more thought to the situation, and to the {{possibility}} of turning it to our advantage, <b>than</b> had <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> From that moment I was well content to do as he suggested, save in one particular, and that was as to which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> should make the first venture, therefore I demanded to know why he claimed the right.|$|R
60|$|Polly {{arrived the}} day after I wrote, and was, poor child, in a dreadful state of grief. Harry came {{the day after}}: to him the shock was greater <b>than</b> to <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> He had not seen her fading {{gradually}} away as we had, and although from our letters, he knew how ill she was, he had never until he came back completely realized it.|$|R
60|$|Sir Percival {{burst out}} laughing, so violently, so outrageously, that he quite startled us all--the Count more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{is a more}} {{surprising}} discovery than Uncle John, Beth. The boy has a better right <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to inherit Elmhurst." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN [greatly amused] Only {{listen to}} him, George! Older <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us!</b> Well {{she has been}} {{stuffing}} you nicely with her importance.|$|E
50|$|The {{movement}} is bigger <b>than</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> But the young {{should know that}} they cannot be irresponsible about {{the present and the}} future because today's anarchy can be tomorrow's slavery. Before long, imperialism will start to exploit the newly created films. If the Brazilian cinema is the palm tree of Tropicalism, {{it is important that the}} people who have lived through the drought are on guard to make sure that Brazilian cinema doesn't become underdeveloped.|$|R
2500|$|... {{that the}} U.S. Sugar Program {{could become the}} next target for reform. However, some {{commentators}} expected heavy lobbying from the U.S. sugar industry, which donated $2.7 million to US House and US Senate incumbents in the 2006 US election, more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other group <b>of</b> <b>US</b> food-growers.|$|R
60|$|The change {{back was}} more marked in Margaret <b>than</b> in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> Perhaps {{it was that}} she was a woman, whilst we were men; perhaps {{it was that she}} was younger than the rest; perhaps both reasons were effective, each in its own way. At any rate the change was there, and I was happier than I had been through the long journey. All her buoyancy, her tenderness, her deep feeling seemed to shine forth once more; now and again as her father's eyes rested on her, his face seemed to light up.|$|R
60|$|SHEFFIELD--Yes, we must talk to him--quite openly, if we're forced to. After all, I {{guess he}} realizes the {{situation}} more keenly <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can do more}} <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> Mrs. Pendyce, {{both with}} George and with this man Bellew--and, if I am not mistaken, with his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{needed this}} holiday more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> Harold. I am glad {{it has given}} you fresh {{strength}} for your sad toiling life in town." ...|$|E
500|$|While the {{development}} teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport Robert Buron {{was meeting with}} the UK Minister of Aviation Peter Thorneycroft, and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> companies. The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due {{to the belief that}} the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of [...] "giving away" [...] US technological leadership to a European partner.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, Catton {{accepted}} the position as founding {{editor of the}} new magazine American Heritage. Catton served initially as a writer, reviewer, and editor. In the first issue, he wrote: We intend to deal with that great, unfinished and illogically inspiring story of the American people doing, being and becoming. Our American heritage is greater <b>than</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> It can express itself in very homely truths; in the end it can lift up our eyes beyond the glow in the sunset skies.|$|R
60|$|That canvas {{wanted more}} putting up <b>than</b> I think <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had bargained for. It looked so simple in the abstract. You took five iron arches, like {{gigantic}} croquet hoops, and fitted them {{up over the}} boat, and then stretched the canvas over them, and fastened it down: it would take quite ten minutes, we thought.|$|R
60|$|STREPHON. But your vow. Have you {{forgotten}} that? We all swore {{together in}} that temple: {{the temple of}} love. You were more earnest <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{are from}} Mr. John Effingham, who {{insists that he}} will come nearer to your heart <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> though the gift be of so little cost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{doing more}} for the cause <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> She's giving her youth--for, alas! when I was young there were {{domestic}} circumstances--" [...] she sighed, and stopped short.|$|E
50|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Wells Fargo's {{domestic}} profits rose faster <b>than</b> those <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other <b>U.S.</b> bank. Wells Fargo's {{loans to}} businesses increased dramatically after 1971. To {{meet the demand}} for credit, the bank frequently borrowed short-term from the Federal Reserve to lend at higher rates of interest to businesses and individuals.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, Elco {{formed the}} Elco Naval Division in Bayonne, New Jersey. Nearly 400 Elco PT boats were {{produced}} for the U.S. Navy. After experimentation, the first PT boat built in any quantity was the 73-foot type. Later 77-foot and 80-foot types were built. More 80-foot Elco boats were built <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other type <b>of</b> <b>US</b> motor torpedo boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "All that we know, Master Pilate," [...] {{retorted}} Conolly with a laugh. [...] "And {{we know a}} good deal. It {{may seem}} small in comparison with what we dont know; {{but it is more}} <b>than</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can hold, for all that. We know, for instance, that the world was not planned by a sentimental landscape gardener. If Marian ever learns that--which she may, although I am neither able nor willing to teach it to her--she will not thank those who gave her so much falsehood to unlearn. Until then, she will, I am afraid, do little else than lay up a store of regrets for herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Henry? He’s {{in worse}} case <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> His {{man is the}} only person who really understands that ridiculous new-fangled Turkish bath that he insists on taking with him everywhere.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! 'tis {{you that}} {{really need the}} holiday," [...] said Carey, wistfully; [...] "much more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> Look at this great crow's foot," [...] tracing it with her finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you are, but you are, Harold!" [...] I {{remember}} {{crying out}} with tears. [...] "God has made {{you to be}} nobler, and greater, and better <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> if you only would--" ...|$|E
2500|$|A United States Note, {{also known}} as a Legal Tender Note, was a type of paper money that was issued from 1862 to 1971 in the U.S. Having been current for over 100 years, they were issued for longer <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other form <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> paper money. They were known popularly as [...] "greenbacks" [...] in their day, a name {{inherited}} from the Demand Notes that they replaced in 1862.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the white {{population}} of Atlanta has increased. Between 2000 and 2010, {{the proportion of}} whites in the city's population grew faster <b>than</b> that <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other <b>U.S.</b> city. In that decade, Atlanta's white population grew from 31% to 38% of the city's population, an absolute increase of 22,753 people, more than triple the increase that occurred between 1990 and 2000.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's in this way," [...] Mr. Jarvis interrupted. [...] "Owing, I dare say, to Mrs. Weatherley, {{you have}} {{certainly}} {{been put in}} a unique position here. You see more of Mr. Weatherley now <b>than</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> For that reason I was anxious to make a confidant of you. I tell you that I am worried about Mr. Weatherley. He is a rich man and a prosperous man. There is no reason why he should sit in his office and gaze into the fire and look out of the window as though the place were full of shadows and he hated the sight of them. Yet that is what he does nowadays, Chetwode. What does it mean? I ask you frankly. Haven't you noticed yourself that his behavior is peculiar?" ...|$|R
