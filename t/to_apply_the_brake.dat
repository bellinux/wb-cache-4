5|$|In 2011, a {{new theory}} {{surfaced}} after the newspaper Crónica spoke to the police about {{the cause of the}} accident. The police source mentioned the possibility that Rodrigo's intensive routine might have increased the production of adrenaline in his body. The investigators explained that, if Rodrigo did not release the excess adrenaline through urination after his last concert, he could have lost his sense of distance in relation to Pesquera's Blazer. This could have caused Rodrigo <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> and turn the wheel violently.|$|E
25|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> A disadvantage might be brake fade - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|E
25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{straight}} air system, the Westinghouse system uses {{a reduction in}} air pressure in <b>the</b> train line <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ways {{of resolving}} sudden {{unintended}} acceleration are <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and/or clutch, or shift into Neutral or Park {{if the car}} has an automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> <b>to</b> all of {{the cars}} {{at about the same}} time, {{pressure}} is released from the train pipe, causing the triple valve on each car <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>To</b> release <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> on each car, pressure is increased in the train pipe until an excess pressure above that of the pressure in each auxiliary cylinder is reached, which throws the triple valve so as to close the inlet to <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder and open the inlet to the auxiliary reservoir from the train pipe, thus allowing the equilibrium of the two pressures to be reached.|$|R
2500|$|A second {{interim report}} was {{released}} on 20 February 2017. In April 2017, {{it was reported that}} there had been three cases of speeding on the section of line which included the accident site in the period November 2016 – April 2017. In one case, a tram was reported to be doing [...] in a [...] zone. Within the second interim report the RAIB notes that drivers of trams approaching the curve can be expected to sight the curve and the speed restriction sign from 90 meters with full beam headlights on and 60 meters with dipped beam headlights. Although the report states that the tram's braking system was not capable of slowing the tram sufficiently between the point where the speed restriction sign became visible and {{the point at which the}} speed restriction is enforced it also says [...] "There was no sign to indicate to drivers where they should begin <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> for the Sandilands curve; they were expected to know this from their knowledge of the route." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{found it}} {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> {{so that he would}} not take the sharp curves at dangerous speed. The brake did not work well and gave indications that it would not stand a great deal. With steady, rattling creak, and an occasional clank, the car rolled on.|$|E
50|$|When {{left foot}} braking is used <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> and the {{throttle}} {{at the same}} time it is very hard on the car, causing extra wear on the transmission and brakes in particular.|$|E
5000|$|Early systems used manual force <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> shoes; more {{recently}} system have used arrays of electromagnets {{to hold the}} shoes against the rail. In some applications, <b>the</b> shoes are <b>applied</b> by powerful springs, and held off by mechanical or electro-magnetic force.|$|R
50|$|The line {{suffered}} a serious accident at Aley on 12 April 1904. Aley had grown with the railroad and {{functioned as a}} summer resort {{for the people of}} Beirut. Part of the locomotive exploded on the 7% incline east of town and, not thinking <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>the</b> train was allowed to fly back through the station. Two cars were completely destroyed upon the rocks on the other side, killing 8 and seriously injuring 21.|$|R
50|$|In some situations, {{however, the}} driver is unaware that they have passed a signal at danger and so {{continues}} until a collision occurs, as in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash. In this instance, {{it is up to}} the safety system (where fitted) <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> or for <b>the</b> signaller to alert the driver.|$|R
50|$|EBS still {{relies on}} {{compressed}} air for braking {{and is only}} controlling the air through valves which means {{that it is not}} depending on higher voltages used by the electromechanical or electrohydraulical brake systems where electric power also is used <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pressure.|$|E
5000|$|School buses {{which are}} {{equipped}} with a hydraulic brake system will have a hand brake lever {{to the left of}} the driver (in left hand drive buses) near the floor. It is operated by pushing the lever down with one's hand <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> and pulling it upwards to release it.|$|E
50|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> A disadvantage might be brake fade - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|E
50|$|A {{distant signal}} (Vorsignal) shows Vr 0 by a yellow disc or two yellow lights (the right light {{is above the}} left light). This signal {{indicates}} that its respective main signal shows Hp 0. As the signal is placed at <b>braking</b> distance from <b>the</b> main signal, <b>the</b> driver needs <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> immediately <b>to</b> stop the train before reaching the main signal.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} design a system without the {{shortcomings}} of the straight air system, Westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an air reservoir and a triple valve, {{also known as a}} control valve. Unlike the straight air system, the Westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in <b>the</b> train line <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 27 January 2006 {{at least}} four {{passengers}} were slightly injured when a [...] train ran into the buffer stop at [...] The 6:05 pm service from [...] was travelling at a speed {{at the time of}} the collision of approximately six miles per hour. An investigation determined that <b>the</b> driver failed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> in a [...] "timely and appropriate manner".|$|R
50|$|In 2011, a {{new theory}} {{surfaced}} after the newspaper Crónica spoke to the police about {{the cause of the}} accident. The police source mentioned the possibility that Rodrigo's intensive routine might have increased the production of adrenaline in his body. The investigators explained that, if Rodrigo did not release the excess adrenaline through urination after his last concert, he could have lost his sense of distance in relation to Pesquera's Blazer. This could have caused Rodrigo <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> and turn the wheel violently.|$|E
50|$|At {{the top of}} {{the plane}} the incline chain/rope passed {{underground}} and into a pit where it was wound one and a half turns around a horizontal drum 14 ft in diameter. The groove in the drum for the chain/rope was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing outwards to increase the friction. Above this groove there was an integral brake wheel about 5 in wide. A wrought iron (or steel) band brake encircled this, which almost made a 360° arc of contact with the brake wheel, and this was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing inwards to increase the friction. The band brake was anchored to the back wall of the pit and at the front, one end was cranked upwards and the other end was cranked downwards. The upward crank was attached above the fulcrum of the brake lever and the downward crank was attached below the fulcrum. The brake lever was about 15 ft long and it extended into the hut at {{the top of the}} tower. In spite of the large mechanical advantage provided by the brake lever, the brakeman was unable <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> unaided. To further increase the mechanical advantage, a pulley block was fitted to the lever and the brakeman used this <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unintended {{acceleration}} {{resulting from}} pedal misapplication is a driver error wherein the driver presses the accelerator when braking is intended. Some shorter drivers' feet {{may not be}} long enough to touch the floor and pedals, making them more likely to press the wrong pedal {{due to a lack}} of proper spatial or tactile reference. Pedal misapplication may be related to pedal design and placement, as in cases where the brake and accelerator are too close to one another, or the accelerator pedal too large. The US NHTSA estimates 16,000 accidents per year in USA, when drivers intend <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> but mistakenly apply the accelerator.|$|E
50|$|These {{continuous}} brakes can {{be simple}} or automatic, the essential difference being what happens should the train break in two. With simple brakes, pressure is needed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> and all braking power is lost if the continuous hose is broken for any reason. Simple non-automatic brakes are thus useless when things really go wrong, as is shown with the Armagh rail disaster.|$|R
30|$|Acceleration control: when, {{due to a}} lane change, {{there is}} no longer a vehicle ahead of the driver's vehicle, the system accelerates the vehicle up to the {{velocity}} set by the driver, and then maintains a constant velocity. Furthermore, when the driver's vehicle approaches a vehicle ahead of it without slowing down enough, an alert buzzer and display prompt <b>the</b> driver <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> or take other appropriate action.|$|R
30|$|Time-To-Collision (TTC): The most {{standard}} indicator is the Time-To-Collision, which {{corresponds to the}} time remaining before the collision occursd. It {{can be used as}} an indication of what action (if any) should be taken [[2],[6],[9],[15],[66]]. For example, when the TTC is still large, it might be preferable to inform or warn the driver rather than <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> For autonomous emergency <b>braking</b> applications, <b>the</b> TTC can be compared with the time required for the vehicle to come to a full stop in order to decide when <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> [[67]]. For driver warning applications, the driver reaction time needs {{to be added to the}} time to stop the vehicle [[13]]. The TTC can also be used as a tool to identify the least dangerous maneuver for an autonomous vehicle, by assuming that the risk of executing a specific trajectory for the autonomous vehicle is inversely proportional to the earliest TTC (the TTC is calculated for all the possible trajectories of the other vehicles in the scene) [[42]].|$|R
5000|$|On December 30, 2016, a South Korean celebrity named Son Ji-chang filed {{a lawsuit}} against Tesla, claims of sudden {{unintended}} acceleration of his Tesla Model X. The lawsuit cites seven other Model X-related complaints registered in a NHTSA database dealing with sudden acceleration without warning. [...] "The evidence, including data from the car, conclusively shows that the crash was the result of Mr. Son pressing the accelerator pedal all the way to 100 percent," [...] Tesla said in response to the lawsuit. The NHTSA estimates 16,000 accidents per year in U.S. are caused when drivers intend <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> but mistakenly apply the accelerator.|$|E
5000|$|Various brake designs such as band {{brakes and}} many drum brakes are self-assisting: when the brake is applied, {{some of the}} braking force feeds back into the brake {{mechanism}} to further self-apply the brake. This is called [...] "positive feedback" [...] or [...] "self-servo". Self-assist reduces the input force needed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> but exaggerates fade, since a reduction in pad friction material height or thickness also reduces pad force. In contrast, for a brake without self-assist, such as a conventional disc brake, a loss of pad friction material {{does not change the}} pad force, so there is no necessary loss in the brake torque reaction for a given amount of input force.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{interim report}} was {{released}} on 20 February 2017. In April 2017, {{it was reported that}} there had been three cases of speeding on the section of line which included the accident site in the period November 2016 - April 2017. In one case, a tram was reported to be doing 40 mph in a 25 mph zone. Within the second interim report the RAIB notes that drivers of trams approaching the curve can be expected to sight the curve and the speed restriction sign from 90 meters with full beam headlights on and 60 meters with dipped beam headlights. Although the report states that the tram's braking system was not capable of slowing the tram sufficiently between the point where the speed restriction sign became visible and {{the point at which the}} speed restriction is enforced it also says [...] "There was no sign to indicate to drivers where they should begin <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> for the Sandilands curve; they were expected to know this from their knowledge of the route." ...|$|E
25|$|Passenger trains {{have had}} {{for a long time}} a 3-wire version of <b>the</b> {{electro-pneumatic}} <b>brake,</b> which gives seven levels of braking force. In most cases the system is not fail-safe, with the wires being energized in sequence <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> but <b>the</b> conventional automatic air brake is also provided to act as a fail safe, and in most cases can be used independently {{in the event of a}} failure of <b>the</b> EP <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Later {{systems were}} {{fitted with a}} sliding {{mechanism}} within the coupling enables the drawbar to {{move back and forth}} relative to the trailer chassis. When <b>the</b> towing vehicle <b>brakes,</b> <b>the</b> inertia of the trailer slides the mechanism, this in turn uses the travel of this mechanism to pull on <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> rod which <b>applies</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>The</b> sliding mechanism contains a damper to even out the shock loading transmitted from the tow vehicle. Therefore,the inertia of the trailer provides <b>the</b> force <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Most bicycle {{brake systems}} consist of three main {{components:}} {{a mechanism for}} <b>the</b> rider <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> such as brake levers or pedals; a mechanism for transmitting that signal, such as Bowden cables, hydraulic hoses, rods, or the bicycle chain; and <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> mechanism itself, a caliper or drum, to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert, via friction, kinetic energy of the bike and rider into thermal energy to be dissipated.|$|R
50|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted handbrakes.Power assisted handbrakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional handbrake, but pulling the lever will operate a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the handbrake easier. When releasing the handbrake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.Power operated handbrakes are fitted to heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These usually are spring applied, with air pressure being used to hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} experimental tests results {{about the influence}} of the tyre contact patch on the stopping distance of automotive vehicles. The objective of the performed tests is the evaluation of the effect of tyre inflation pressure, hence the resulting tyre contact patch on the braking system and the brake distance. The conditions of the experiment are a dry and level road surface without steering inputs. To record scientific results, a brake robot system is used. The benefit of a robotic system is the elimination of the interfering variable driver, who is not able <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> system at the same time with the same force. State-of-the-art data acquisition tools are used to log the data...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{autonomous}} braking {{system based on}} deep reinforcement learning. The proposed autonomous braking system automatically decides whether <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> at each time step when confronting the risk of collision using {{the information on the}} obstacle obtained by the sensors. The problem of designing brake control is formulated as searching for the optimal policy in Markov decision process (MDP) model where the state is given by the relative position of the obstacle and the vehicle's speed, and the action space is defined as whether brake is stepped or not. The policy used for brake control is learned through computer simulations using the deep reinforcement learning method called deep Q-network (DQN). In order to derive desirable braking policy, we propose the reward function which balances the damage imposed to the obstacle in case of accident and the reward achieved when the vehicle runs out of risk as soon as possible. DQN is trained for the scenario where a vehicle is encountered with a pedestrian crossing the urban road. Experiments show that the control agent exhibits desirable control behavior and avoids collision without any mistake in various uncertain environments...|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanical}} advantage of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> lever must be matched to <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> it {{is connected to}} {{in order for the}} rider to have sufficient leverage and travel to actuate <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> Using mismatched brakes and levers could result in too much {{mechanical advantage}} and hence not enough travel to properly actuate <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> (v-brakes with conventional levers) or too little mechanical advantage, requiring a very strong pull <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> hard (v-brake levers with other types of brake).|$|R
25|$|The {{first known}} fatal {{accident}} involving a Model S {{occurred when the}} autopilot was active in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016. In June 2016, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn {{in front of the}} Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and <b>the</b> car failed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>The</b> NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use {{at the time of the}} crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.|$|R
