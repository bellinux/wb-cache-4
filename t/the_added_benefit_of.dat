5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E
5|$|The German UB II {{design of}} coastal {{submarines}} was a development from {{the design of}} the UB I boats, which had been originally ordered in September 1914. During their trials, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow, but in-service use revealed another problem. The UB I boats had a single propeller shaft/engine combo such that if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. The UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine) which not only alleviated this problem, but also had <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> increasing the top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. The UB II boats could also carry twice the torpedo load of their predecessors, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To contain all of these changes the hull was larger, and the surface and submerged displacement was more than doubled.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped {{that there might be}} some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Managed {{accounts}} {{started as}} separately managed accounts (SMAs) and have since evolved into multiple strategy accounts (MSAs) and the rapidly emerging unified managed accounts (UMAs). There is broad agreement that managed accounts provide <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> greater transparency, liquidity and control.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cordless}} telephones have a handset speakerphone {{as well as}} a base speakerphone. The handset speakerphone allows {{hands free}} conversations away from the base unit. The base speakerphone is located in the base unit. The user must be at the base unit, but still gets <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> having hands free conversations. Most base speakerphones have a secondary keypad for dialing calls on the base unit.|$|R
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may {{be as simple as}} tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
25|$|In July 2005, the {{university}} purchased the Belgrave Centre, thus releasing Nottingham Law School from its ongoing rental commitment along with <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> providing rental {{income from the}} Government Office of the East Midlands, which had a tenancy agreement until 2010 for {{approximately half of the}} building.|$|E
25|$|As these {{bees are}} {{relatively}} short-lived, {{there is no}} generation overlap. However, old, abandoned and empty nests will be repaired and reused by new female bees. This is advantageous as they will only need to provision pollen to nurture larval development. It also has <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> decreasing the time required for nest completion and allowing females to put more resources into laying more eggs.|$|E
5000|$|Tradition {{has it that}} {{a walnut}} tree should be beaten. The old saying runs, [...] "A woman, a dog and a walnut tree; the harder they're beaten, the better they be." [...] The saying is {{believed}} to originate from the mainland European practice of harvesting by beating with long poles. This would have <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> removing dead wood and stimulating shoot formation.|$|R

25|$|Stableford {{can have}} <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> {{speeding}} up the pace of play, as once {{it is no longer}} possible to score a point, players do not have to complete the hole but can simply pick up their ball and proceed to the next hole. It is a popular form of the game, especially at club level and particularly in the United Kingdom, as it is still possible to record a competitive score despite having the occasional bad hole.|$|E
25|$|District heating has various {{advantages}} {{compared to}} individual heating systems. Usually district heating is more energy efficient, due to simultaneous production {{of heat and}} electricity in {{combined heat and power}} generation plants. This has <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> reducing carbon emissions. The larger combustion units also have a more advanced flue gas cleaning than single boiler systems. In the case of surplus heat from industries, district heating systems do not use additional fuel because they recover heat which would otherwise be dispersed to the environment.|$|E
25|$|After 123 {{production}} aircraft {{had been built}} a number of improvements {{were made to the}} 112 in 1974, producing the 112A. The doors were fixed by replacing them with new aluminum units, which added still more weight, but had <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> making the cabin quieter. The wing was redesigned internally with increased fuel capacity and a 100lb increase in maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) to 2,650lb; After another 30 112s were built, Rockwell offered an option for increased fuel capacity (68 US gallon vs. 48 gallon standard tanks).|$|E

The FS and XS models were both {{powered by the}} 140hp 3S-FE engine, whereas the ZS models were powered by the 170-180hp 3S-GE engine. The ZS Sport Selection had <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> a limited slip differential and a leather steering wheel. The ST207 only came in the XS Touring Selection, which was powered by the 3S-FE and came equipped with four wheel steering and Toyota's active suspension package called TACS.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{involves}} improved sanitation {{and access}} to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. They have <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E.coli. The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapyâ€”the replacement of fluids with slightly sweet and salty solutions. Rice-based solutions are preferred. Zinc supplementation is useful in children. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.|$|E
30|$|Cluster {{analysis}} is a multivariate technique to classify objects {{on the basis}} of their common properties, resulting in groups that are internally homogeneous but maximizes differences among them. In order to cluster our data, we applied the Twoâ€“Step Clustering procedure available in SPSS (release 15.0).

25|$|The Berlin Conference of 1884 {{assigned}} the territory to Germany {{and began a}} policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy; this system had <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> enabling colonization with small European troop numbers. European colonists, convinced the Tutsi had migrated to Rwanda from Ethiopia, believed the Tutsi were more Caucasian than the Hutu and were therefore racially superior and better suited to carry out colonial administrative tasks. King Yuhi V Musinga welcomed the Germans, whom he used to strengthen his rule. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and the country was formally passed to Belgian control by a League of Nations mandate in 1919.|$|E
25|$|One of Chagall's major {{contributions}} to art {{has been his}} work with stained glass. This medium allowed him further to express his desire to create intense and fresh colors and had <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> natural light and refraction interacting and constantly changing: everything from the position where the viewer stood to the weather outside would alter the visual effect (though {{this is not the}} case with his Hadassah windows). It was not until 1956, when he was nearly 70 years of age, that he designed windows for the church at Assy, his first major project.

25|$|William {{considered}} his veteran army to be sufficient {{in size to}} defeat any forces (all rather inexperienced) that James could throw against him, {{but it had been}} decided to avoid the hazards of battle and maintain a defensive attitude in the hope James's position might collapse by itself. Thus he landed far away from James's army, expecting that his English allies would take the initiative in acting against James while he ensured his own protection against potential attacks. William was prepared to wait; he had paid his troops in advance for a three-month campaign. A slow advance, apart from being necessitated by heavy rainfall anyway, had <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> not over-extending the supply lines; the Dutch troops were under strict orders not even to forage, for fear that this would degenerate into plundering, which would alienate the population.|$|E
25|$|DrÄƒghici {{was also}} {{involved}} in the disinformation campaign launched by the Securitate. The latter planted Silviu CrÄƒciunaÈ™, with false anti-communist credentials, inside the Romanian National Committee of Washington, D. C.. DrÄƒghici himself released political captives such as Herant Torosian, indicating through CrÄƒciunaÈ™ that Romania {{would allow them to}} leave for the West in exchange for foreign currency. This proposal had <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> generating false trust in CrÄƒciunaÈ™ amid the Romanian American exiles. According to DrÄƒghici's own justification, selling off Romanian nationals to other countries was a banal occurrence, particularly so for Jews emigrating to Israel. He claimed to have collected 6,250,000 US dollars from this source alone, and to have thus enriched the national budget. As historian Marius Oprea notes, this initiative of his was the culmination of periodic antisemitic purges inside and outside the party structures.|$|E
25|$|The steep hillsides {{along the}} Mosel and Rhine rivers {{provided}} an opportunity to extend the cultivation of grapes to a northerly location. A south-southwest-facing slope maximizes the amount of sunshine vines receive, with the degree of angle allowing the vines to receive the sun's rays perpendicularly {{rather than at the}} low or diffuse angle vineyards on flatter terrain receive. Hillsides offered <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> shielding vines from the cold northern winds, and the rivers' reflection offered additional warmth to aid in ripening the grapes. With the right type of grape (perhaps even an early ancestor of the German wine grape Riesling), the Romans found that wine could be produced in Germania. From the Rhine, German wine would make its way downriver to the North Sea and to merchants in Britain, where it began to develop a good reputation.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Experimental data are {{presented}} {{to show how}} imposed force fields can reduce flux decline during the crossflow microfiltration of aqueous, mineral based suspensions. Both electric and ultrasonic fields, employed individually or in combination, help prevent particle accumulation at the separating surface. This allows fluid removal rates {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those obtained in comparable tests without imposed force fields to be achieved. Such process intensification is demonstrated to have <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> lower overall power requirements, reduced pumping requirements and smaller filtration areas...|$|R
40|$|Whereas, historically, much of {{the effort}} on {{computer-aided}} geometric design has concentrated {{on the problems of}} representing so-called sculptured surfaces, there has recently been much interest in systems which can handle typical mechanical components by a volume modelling approach. The paper is concerned with the possibility of combining the two approaches and discusses the issues raised. A solution in terms of applying smoothing operators to a geometric coarse structure is proposed, with <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> detecting and successfully handling anomalous regions in surfaces and leading to potential benefits in the analysis of geometric properties...|$|R
50|$|Rice straw has water {{repellent}} properties. Raindrops striking a mat of straw {{will tend to}} flow along the fibers of the mat, rather than penetrate underneath it. For this reason, early Japanese rain gear was often made of straw, which has <b>the</b> <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> being cheap to acquire, easy to weave and fasten, and light in weight. It is, however, bulky in size, and highly flammable. In earlier eras, straw clothing had an additional advantage: it afforded a significant degree of camouflage in certain terrain, including forests and wetlands, similar to modern Ghillie suits.|$|R
