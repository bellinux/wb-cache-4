5|$|Clique-finding {{algorithms}} {{have been}} used in chemistry, to find chemicals that match a target structure and to model molecular docking and the binding sites of chemical reactions. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to find similar structures within different molecules.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} can {{be produced}} from their constituent ions by evaporation, precipitation, or freezing. Reactive metals such as the alkali metals can react directly with the highly electronegative halogen gases to form an ionic product. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> synthesized {{as the product of}} a high temperature reaction between solids.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings, {{and less}} {{white in the}} tail feathers. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{distinguished}} by their constant begging calls. It {{is not possible to}} tell the sexes apart until the male's bill begins to darken. This begins when the male is around one year old, and is complete some time after two years of age.|$|E
50|$|Discodeles vogti inhabit {{streams in}} {{tropical}} rain forests, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> found in suburban areas, rural gardens, and other degraded habitats, albeit at lower densities than in mature forests. The species breeds by direct development and lays its eggs on the ground. It {{is threatened by}} habitat loss caused by logging. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> consumed for food.|$|R
50|$|Tobacco {{contains}} the alkaloid nicotine, {{which is a}} stimulant. Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored shisha tobacco. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.|$|R
50|$|From late 2016, 29 of the Class 387/1s {{operating}} on Thameslink were {{displaced by the}} delivery of Class 700 Desiro City units, and were transferred to Great Northern.

5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} short-finned pilot whale, the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> hostile.|$|E
5000|$|The climbers use {{accepted}} climbing {{practices and}} state-of-the-art techniques appropriate to their climbing era. For example, they wear tubular nylon webbing [...] "swami belts" [...] around {{their bodies and}} tie the rope into them rather than harnesses clipped to the rope with carabiners. Also, though they use familiar hex nuts <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> seen hammering pitons into cracks for protection.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{portable}} ramps {{are available}} for use with many vehicles and typically do not require any vehicle modification. Portable wheelchair ramps cost much less both to purchase and to maintain. Since they are not attached to the vehicle, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used for handicapped access for other applications.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> easily <b>be</b> {{adapted to}} take values in any Lie group, by {{replacing}} the diagonal matrices by the maximal torus, {{and other similar}} modifications.|$|R
5|$|Abundant {{in eastern}} Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer {{temperate}} bushlands, {{and are usually}} located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands. The species {{is found in the}} eastern states of Australia, mostly on the coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found. They prefer tropical climates and warm temperatures. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E
5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E
50|$|Dog coats <b>are</b> <b>also</b> used functionally. <b>They</b> <b>can,</b> however, <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used as fashion accessories. Dog coats worn {{inside and}} not in {{response}} to the elements are primarily for show only.|$|R
50|$|The University chamber choir, The Elizabethan Madrigal Singers, {{have been}} {{singing in the}} town since 1950 and {{continue}} to hold a number of concerts throughout the year. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> often <b>be</b> heard singing in local pubs.|$|R

5|$|Auxois {{horses are}} usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> chestnut or red roan, {{similar to the}} Ardennais. gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois {{is known for its}} power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Chicken {{hearts are}} {{considered}} to be giblets, and are often grilled on skewers: Japanese hāto yakitori, Brazilian churrasco de coração, Indonesian chicken heart satay. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> pan-fried, as in Jerusalem mixed grill. In Egyptian cuisine, they can be used, finely chopped, as part of stuffing for chicken. Many recipes combined them with other giblets, such as the Mexican pollo en menudencias and the Russian ragu iz kurinyikh potrokhov.|$|E
50|$|Besides their similar morphology, graminoids {{share the}} {{widespread}} occurrence and often dominance in open habitats such as grasslands or marshes. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> however <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{found in the}} understory of forests. Sedges and rushes tend to prefer wetter habitats than grasses.|$|R
5000|$|Wrinkles {{have been}} sold as part of Ganz's [...] "Heritage Collection", though the line {{appears to have been}} discontinued. Wrinkles dogs are fairly common fare on eBay and other auction sites selling toys. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> still <b>be</b> {{purchased}} from the original designers at Senitt Puppets.|$|R
5000|$|Questions and negatives {{are formed}} {{from all of}} the above constructions in the regular manner: see Questions and Negation in the English grammar article. The {{auxiliaries}} will and shall form the contracted negations won't and shan't (<b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> sometimes <b>be</b> contracted when not negated, to [...] 'll).|$|R
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> crushed to yield a blue colorant that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis {{is found}} in Europe; it does not occur in North America, {{although}} a number of similar brownish-orange species were formerly classified under this species. It {{is found in}} broad-leaved woodland, especially {{on the floor at}} the base of beech trees. Along with L. vellereus, L.subdulcis is the most common fungi found on beech trees. The mushrooms can be found from late summer to late autumn, and are common. They are found individually, or in small groups. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> found in fields, generally appearing in large batches, with groups of over a hundred mushrooms not uncommon.|$|E
50|$|At intersections, roads cross at-grade. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> further {{subdivided}} into those {{with and without}} signal controls.|$|R
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> {{used in the}} {{production}} of dyes and in organic synthesis. For example, 2-naphthol reacts to form BINOL.|$|R
3000|$|... 10 While {{remittances}} {{need not}} always have an explicit investment purpose, they generally benefit the migrant by maintaining his/her membership rights, and by improving his/her social status in the community. In this case, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> therefore <b>also</b> <b>be</b> considered {{as a form of}} investment.|$|R
5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} its various {{artificial}} imitations {{are widely used}} as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup {{can also be used}} as a replacement for honey in wine (mead).|$|E
5|$|Player created digital walkthroughs are {{typically}} designed to assist other players in accomplishing certain feats within {{video games and}} are similar to text-based or telephony-based walkthroughs, except <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> solely for entertainment purposes. These digital walkthroughs {{are typically}} uploaded to video sharing websites such as YouTube or live-streamed playthroughs to media streaming sites such as Twitch.tv. Let's Play videos are a special type of walkthrough generally more focused on entertaining rather than informing the viewer through humorous commentary given by the video's host as they complete the game.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway breed {{comes from}} the cattle native to the {{south-west}} region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book. As a result, although black {{is still the most}} common colour for Galloways, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> red and several shades of dun. In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed.|$|E
50|$|Fugitive glues {{are usually}} {{available}} in hot melt or latex form, with low VOC emissions. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> applied in liquid form.|$|R
50|$|Basket ferns are epiphytic (growing on trees) or epipetric (growing on rocks). <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{sometimes}} <b>be</b> {{found in}} man-made structures like brick walls. They {{are found in}} wet tropical environments, usually in rainforests. Their native range extends from equatorial Africa to tropical South and East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Oceania.|$|R
50|$|In captivity, {{this species}} can be fed {{on a wide}} range of fruit and vegetables, plain unseasoned mince or boiled egg. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{occasionally}} <b>be</b> fed cuttlefish bone, which is commonly used as a calcium source for healthy shell growth. It requires about 18.28% of crude protein in its diet for optimal growth.|$|R
