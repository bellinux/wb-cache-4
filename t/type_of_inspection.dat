Choosing between preventive and major rehabilitation under uncertainties and financial constraints is a crucial issue. A model using lifetime functions to assess the probability of survival of bridges is proposed. The impact of inspecting the structure is modeled by updating the Probability Density Function (PDF) of time to failure. Depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> the uncertainty associated with the inspection result varies. Visual inspections are associ¬ated with greater uncertainties than in-depth inspections. Therefore, the provided information associated with visual inspections is less accurate than that provided by in-depth inspections and, consequently, the updating of the PDF of time to failure is less effective. An optimization framework is proposed where expected inspection, maintenance and failure costs are simultaneously minimized. The proposed approach is applied to an existing bridge...|$|E
