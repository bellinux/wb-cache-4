40|$|We {{establish}} {{a relationship between}} Heegaard Floer homology and the fractional Dehn <b>twist</b> <b>coefficient</b> of surface automorphisms. Specifically, we show that the rank of the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3 -manifold bounds the absolute value of the fractional Dehn <b>twist</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the monodromy of any of its open book decompositions with connected binding. We prove this by showing that the rank of Floer homology gives bounds {{for the number of}} boundary parallel right or left Dehn twists necessary to add to a surface automorphism to guarantee that the associated contact manifold is tight or overtwisted, respectively. By examining branched double covers, we also show that the rank of the Khovanov homology of a link bounds the fractional Dehn <b>twist</b> <b>coefficient</b> of its odd-stranded braid representatives.

40|$|We {{characterize}} the fractional Dehn <b>twist</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a braid {{in terms of}} a slope of the homogenization of the Upsilon function, where Upsilon is the function-valued concordance homomorphism defined by Ozsváth, Stipsicz, and Szabó. We use this characterization to prove that n-braids with fractional Dehn <b>twist</b> <b>coefficient</b> larger than n- 1 realize the braid index of their closure. As a consequence, we are able to prove a conjecture of Malyutin and Netsvetaev stating that n-times twisted braids realize the braid index of their closure. We provide examples that address the optimality of our results. The paper ends with an appendix about the homogenization of knot concordance homomorphisms.

40|$|Let M be an open, {{connected}} manifold. A classical theorem of McDuff and Segal {{states that}} the sequence of configuration spaces of n unordered, distinct points in M is homologically stable with coefficients in Z: in each degree, the integral homology is eventually independent of n. The purpose of this note is to prove that this phenomenon also holds for homology with <b>twisted</b> <b>coefficients.</b> We first define an appropriate notion of finite-degree <b>twisted</b> <b>coefficient</b> system for configuration spaces and then use a spectral sequence argument to deduce the result from the untwisted homological stability result of McDuff and Segal. The result and the methods are generalisations of those of Betley for the symmetric groups. Comment: v 3 : 25 page...|$|R

40|$|Let M_g be the moduli {{space of}} smooth genus g curves. We define {{a notion of}} Chow groups of M_g with {{coefficients}} in a representation of Sp(2 g), and we define a subgroup of tautological classes in these Chow groups with <b>twisted</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Studying the tautological groups of M_g with <b>twisted</b> <b>coefficients</b> is equivalent to studying the tautological rings of all fibered powers C_g^n of the universal curve C_g → M_g simultaneously. By taking the direct sum over all irreducible representations of the symplectic group in fixed genus, one obtains {{the structure of a}} twisted commutative algebra on the tautological classes. We obtain some structural results for this twisted commutative algebra, and we are able to calculate it explicitly when g ≤ 4. Thus we determine R^∗(C_g^n) completely, for all n, in these genera. We also give some applications to the Faber conjecture. Comment: 48 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{convergence}} {{properties of the}} polarized Bjorken sum rule amplitude with the four-loop expression for the coeﬃcient function, CBj(αs), {{in the framework of}} the common QCD perturbation theory and the singularity-free analytic perturbation theory. By using the model for the multiloop QCD correction, we tested the convergence properties of the coeﬃcient function. Our analysis of the PT series for this function gives a hint to its asymptotic nature manifesting itself in the region Q < 1 GeV. Besides, the related values of the higher <b>twists</b> <b>coeﬃcients</b> turn out to be highly unstable with respect to the PT order. On the contrary, the APT approach allows us to describe accurately the whole bulk of the JLab data down to Q ∼ 300 MeV and gives a possibility for reliable extraction of stable values for the higher <b>twists</b> <b>coeﬃcients</b> providing accuracy of theoretical predictions higher then accuracy of current data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{addresses}} the two significant aspects of Ozsváth and Szabó’s knot Floer cube of resolutions that differentiate it from Khovanov and Rozansky’s HOMFLY-PT chain complex: (1) {{the use of}} <b>twisted</b> <b>coefficients</b> and (2) {{the appearance of a}} mysterious non-local ideal. Our goal is to facilitate progress on Rasmussen’s conjecture that a spectral sequence relates the two knot homologies. We replace the language of <b>twisted</b> <b>coefficients</b> with the more quantum topological language of framings on trivalent graphs. We define a homology theory for framed trivalent graphs with boundary that – for a particular non-blackboard framing – specializes to the homology of singular knots underlying the knot Floer cube of resolutions. For blackboard framed graphs, our theory conjecturally recovers the graph homology underlying the HOMFLY-PT chain complex. We explain the appearance of the non-local ideal by expressing it as an ideal quotient of an ideal that appears in both the HOMFLY-PT and knot Floer cubes of resolutions. This result is a corollary of our main theorem, which is that closing a strand in a braid graph corresponds to taking an ideal quotient of its non-local ideal. The proof is a Gröbner basis argument that connects the combinatorics of the non-local ideal to those of Buchberger’s Algorithm. 1...|$|R
