Weaving patterns, opposed to knitting patterns, are more often used for knotless netting. Jason Mills states that, as there are no knots used to produce this kind of netting, it is usually less sturdy and movable. Each strand, when used for a knotless netting weave, can sometimes be coated before being woven to ensure more durability. If a weave is coated after being woven it can show to be more durable when exposed to heat or pressure- depending on the type of coat ...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradable sizing {{agents were}} {{developed}} from physically modified soy protein, acrylic-acid grafted soy protein and soymeal to substitute poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) sizes for high-speed weaving and reduce environmental pollution from textile desizing effluent. PVA {{is the best}} <b>textile</b> <b>size</b> due to its excellent film properties and adhesion to fibers. However, non-biodegradability of PVA leads to serious environmental issues. Till now, no biodegradable substitutes with size properties and cost-effectiveness comparable to PVA have been developed. ^ In this research, sizing agents from physically modified soy protein, acrylic-acid grafted soy protein and soy meal were developed to substitute PVA size. The potential of using the soy protein based sizes for warp sizing in textile industry were investigated by tensile properties of size films, adhesion of sizes to yarns, abrasion resistance of sized yarns, industrial-scale weaving performance, desizing efficiency and biodegradability of sizing agent. Our research showed that soy protein based sizes had film elongation, adhesion to yarns and abrasion resistance similar or higher than commercial PVA sizes. Industrial weaving trial showed that, at lower add-on, physically modified soy protein sized cotton and polyester/cotton yarns had weaving efficiencies 13 % and 3 % higher than the PVA sized ones, and 39 % and 10 % higher than the modified starch sized ones. Physically modified soy protein sized polyester yarns had weaving efficiencies similar to the PVA sized ones. In addition, soy protein based sizes had a chemical oxygen demand value of 70 - 109 mg/L after 5 days treatment in activated sludge, much lower than 398 mg/L of PVA, demonstrating that soy protein sizes were readily biodegradable. ...|$|E

Although DDGS is an inexpensive, biodegradable and abundant co-product, it has limited industrial applications. DDGS is a mixture of carbohydrates, proteins and oil which are used as sizing agents or as size additives. The effects of DDGS extraction conditions on sizing evaluation parameters such as fiber adhesion, film properties, viscosity and fabric abrasion were studied in comparison with commercially available PVA or starch based size. Among the various conditions studied, DDGS that was extracted in 0. 5 % alkali concentration solution for 1 hour was most suitable for <b>textiles</b> <b>sizing,</b> based on the improvement in the strength and elongation of rovings and fabric abrasion resistance. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of DDGS size decreased 80 % in 3 days compared to 25 % for PVA demonstrating that DDGS was easily biodegradable in activated sludge. Although DDGS contains up to 30 % protein, the total nitrogen and ammonia released from DDGS sizing agent had negligible effect on biodegradability.

Unfortunately, like other organic materials, it is sensitive to UV light that is the major limitation for its use in exterior conditions. Semiconductor cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs have been chosen as a stabilizing antiageing improver, and their influence on the UV endurance of the NP-containing polymer was studied by optical methods.|$|R

40|$|An {{environmentally}} friendly and inexpensive substitute to the widely used poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) {{has been developed}} from soy proteins for <b>textile</b> warp <b>sizing.</b> <b>Textile</b> processing is {{the major source of}} industrial water pollution across the world, and sizing and desizing operations account for nearly 30 % of the water consumed in a textile plant. PVA {{is one of the most}} common sizing agents used for synthetic fibers and their blends due to PVA’s easy water solubility and ability to provide desired sizing performance. However, PVA does not degrade and is a major contributor to pollution in textile effluent treatment plants. Although considerable efforts have been made to replace PVA with biodegradable sizing materials, the performance properties provided by PVA on synthetic fibers and their blends have been unmatched so far. Soy proteins are inexpensive, biodegradable, and have been widely studied for potential use in food packaging, as resins and adhesives. In this research, the potential of using soy proteins as <b>textile</b> <b>sizing</b> agents to replace PVA was studied. Polyester and polyester/cotton rovings, yarns, and fabrics sized with soy protein showed a considerably better improvement in strength and abrasion resistance compared to commercially available PVA-based size. Soy protein size had a 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand / chemical oxygen demand ratio of 0. 57 compared to 0. 01 for PVA indicating that soy protein sizes were easily biodegradable in activated sludge. The total and ammonia nitrogen released from the proteins also did not adversely impact the biodegradability. Good sizing performance and easy biodegradability demonstrate that soy protein-based sizes have potential to replace PVA-based sizes leading to substantial benefits to the textile industry and the environment...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Marketing)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. This study {{concentrated}} {{on the concept of}} relationship marketing and its implementation by small and medium <b>sized</b> <b>textile</b> retailers in the Northwest province of South Africa. This study addressed the gap between the relationship marketing theory and its implementation by small and medium <b>sized</b> <b>textile</b> retailers in the textile industry of the Northwest province. Researchers in relationship marketing have started to realise that there is a definite need for detailed empirical evidence on how relationship marketing could be implemented in order to establish a beneficial customer-business relationship. This need was one of the bases for carrying out this study. This led to the identification of prerequisites for relationship marketing orientation. These prerequisites are internal marketing and customer orientation. This {{is due to the fact}} that relationship marketing raises the need for customer orientation, and customer orientation raises the need for customer-oriented employees. The latter can be achieved through internal marketing. Without customer oriented employees, there is no customer orientation implementation because employees are the ones that have to make it happen (Reuters, 1999 : 8). If there were no customer orientation (which leads to customer satisfaction), there will be no relationship marketing because unsatisfied customers will never develop good relationships with the business (Engel, Blackwell & Miniard, 1995 : 47). This study found that small to medium <b>sized</b> <b>textile</b> retailers in the Northwest province have shown some problems in implementing the relationship marketing 01 -ientation. This study concluded that small to medium <b>sized</b> <b>textile</b> retailers are not relationship marketing oriented. These conclusions are based on findings. indicating that the relationship marketing concept is not fully understood by the management of most of these small to medium <b>sized</b> <b>textile</b> retailers in the Northwest province. To address this problem, this study recommends some solutions, such as internal marketing and a customer orientation. This study also recommends ten steps that might help to solve,the relationship marketing disorientation problem of small to medium <b>sized</b> <b>textile</b> retailers in the Northwest province. These steps are called the ten daily relationship marketing orientation basics. These steps act as a tool for small to medium-sized textile retailers in the Northwest province to be successful in the market. It is a system that enables the business member to focus on what his job is and then to check that the business is maximising the profit in its outlet through planned daily relationship marketing duties.

PVA has found application also in pharmaceutical, biomedical and biochemical fields, {{due to its}} attractive characteristics, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability and good water-solubility. However, low deformability limits applicability of PVA when compliance is necessary. PVA and poly (vinyl acetate) - (PVAc) composite films (prepared by casting of two-component water-based system blends: a solution of the rigid PVA and emulsion of the compliant plasticized PVAc), show wide range of strength-deformation characteristic, which can be controlled by component ratio. Effect of small amounts (1 - 10 wt %) of nanoparticles: monmorillonite clay (MMT) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) on structural, thermal and strengthdeformation characteristics of PVA, PVAc and PVA - PVAc compounds was studied in this work. Both fillers are characterized by high surface free energy which ensures sufficient dispersibility of particles in water systems and potential compatibility with PVA and PVAc macromolecules. Despite the dissimilar chemical nature, particle {{size and shape of}} fillers, the strength-deformation characteristics of filled films unexpectedly differ little. Films containing MCC show somewhat higher values of the modulus of elasticity and tensile strength, due to more pronounced reinforcing ability of fiber-like cellulose particles, as well as because of presence of hydroxyl groups, which may form strong hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of PVA.

The adaptation of local preferences hence, seems to be crucial but also very complex for multinational retailers. This study therefore, determines the complexity of considerations that a shift from a global to a transnational strategy includes. The decision making of which strategy is appropriate for multinational retailers to compete on a global market can be quite puzzling, as is {{can be seen in the}} bed textile segment. Therefore this research paper investigates, within a case study of IKEA’s bed textile department, if a shift from a global to a transnational strategy is of advantage for a multinational retailer like IKEA and to what extend cultural awareness has to be considered. The methods that were used for this study include a literature review in the mentioned focus area and a collection of primary data through a qualitative research design with an open questionnaire sent to the Sales Leaders of IKEA. The research has shown that market research is an important factor when it comes to cultural related differences between the countries. Also, when dealing with the concern of adaptation of the market relevant bed <b>textile</b> <b>sizes</b> to the product range, the Sales Leaders of IKEA have perceived different concerns. Therewith a full adaptation may not be the solution for all businesses, since this depends on the product and market preferences.

Possible paths for future investigations are shown by the results of this study. Thus, an inclusion of other cases could enable the possibility of a generalization of the study’s findings. Also, the same case study could be expanded by including customers input in the individual markets; this would lead to a better understanding of the customer’s preferences and a higher validity of the study.

Ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) fungi {{have been found to}} produce hydrolytic enzymes (Cairney and Burke 1994, 1998) which include the production of amyloglucosidase. Other reports have also indicated that the enzymatic degradation of organic polymers in the soil and the transfer of some of the resulting products to the root is a significant benefit to the growth and development of ericaceous plants (Smith and Read 2008).
