5|$|Kaepernick {{took over}} on the Nevada 23-yard line with 4:01and made four {{completions}} {{to drive to the}} Terps' 15-yard line. Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an onside kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards. With the first down, Maryland had enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out the clock and clinch the 42–35victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice for them to be destroyed. Players can protect their positions by defusing the explosives before they detonate. In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount of time, with the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if they can hold their positions long enough for the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E

Salonga helped build the party from the grassroots, largely with the support of disgruntled young people who responded to the issues he raised, particularly the entrenchment of the political ruling class and their families in seats of governments, a major cause of disenchantment among the masses. In the November 1961 elections, he bested his two opponents by an overwhelming margin.|$|E
25|$|These {{limitations}} {{mean that}} supporting the multitasking {{of more than}} one program at a time would be difficult, without rewriting all of this operating system and application code. Yet doing so, would mean the system would run unacceptably slow on existing hardware. Instead, Apple adopted a system known as MultiFinder in 1987 which keeps the running application in control of the computer as before but allows an application to be rapidly switched to another, normally simply by clicking on its window. Programs which are not in the foreground are periodically given short bits of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> but as before, the entire process is controlled by the applications, not the operating system.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} building collapses was that of the Conjunto Pino Suárez, which was a complex of five steel-frame buildings. A 20-story tower, Tower Four, doubled over at the third floor and fell south onto a fourteen-story building. The fall left a huge piece of concrete blocking the road that leads to the Zócalo. People at the scene stated that there was simply no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> and escape the building's fall. The other three 20-story buildings were closed because of damage, as well as the Metro entrance next door. The building was occupied by family courts and offices of the public defender. The area now is a commercial center.|$|E
25|$|In {{the paradox}} of Achilles and the {{tortoise}}, Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.|$|E
25|$|Though the midshipmen {{picked up}} one first down on their next drive, {{they were forced to}} punt the ball away with just over two minutes {{remaining}} in the quarter. Greg Veteto's punt was downed at the Utes' 16-yard line. The Utes' offense connected on passes of 10, 18, and 11 yards before Johnson completed a 40-yard pass to Derrek Richards for another touchdown. The 1:24 long drive took five plays and covered 84 yards. With the touchdown, Utah regained the lead by a 21–17 score. Midshipmen Campbell ran the opening kickoff return to the Navy 32-yard line, but the team struggled on the next two plays, fumbling and recovering the ball each time. The two failed plays allowed <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out in the third quarter. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, the Utes held a 21–17 lead.|$|E

25|$|Nottinghamshire won the toss at Headingley and put Yorkshire into bat. The hosts {{suffered}} an immediate setback when Ian Harvey was {{out from the}} first ball to Andrew Harris, but Craig White and Phil Jaques settled the ship, with Jaques going on to score 55 off 33 balls. Richard Pyrah finished the innings with 31 off 17 as Yorkshire set their guests a target of 181 to win. The start of Nottinghamshire's innings was the opposite to Yorkshire's: openers Will Smith (55) and Graeme Swann (62) put on 101 before they were parted, as Swann slashed nine fours, three sixes, and also had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> eight times across the pitch in a 25-ball frenzy. Yorkshire took the next four wickets for 50 runs, with leg spinner Mark Lawson grabbing two, and with a high total to chase the game was in the balance. However, Chris Read's 28 off 18 balls saw Nottinghamshire home with just two balls to go.|$|E
25|$|His accomplishments as {{an athlete}} {{eventually}} led him to public service. As an accomplished youngster, governor Sila María Calderón decided to appoint Bernier to lead the Puerto Rico Office of Youth Affairs in 2003. Two years later, governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá appointed him as Secretary of Sports of Puerto Rico. But as a different political party took over the government, Bernier opted to leave his incumbency {{after four years of}} service. A few months later he was elected president of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee. In that capacity Bernier led the efforts to organize the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games celebrated in Mayaguez. A few years later and as he was preparing for his re-election for president of the committee, governor Alejandro García Padilla appointed him as Secretary of State of Puerto Rico. In that role, Bernier transformed the Department of State of Puerto Rico by creating the Morales Carrión Diplomatic and Foreign Relations School, by opening several Puerto Rican trade promotion offices in foreign countries, and by reducing the backlog of business charters filings and intellectual property filings. Bernier, however, left his incumbency once again but this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for governor of Puerto Rico in the 2016 general election for the Popular Democratic Party.|$|E

Reporting to a government select committee into the operation of the reserves later the same year, Homeswest director Greg Joyce defended Quartermaine: [...] "She has done her best over a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the place.
