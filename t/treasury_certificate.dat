40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} interest rate spreads in Nigeria using a panel of 12 commercial banks for the period 1986 - 2007. The results suggest that cash reserve requirements, average loans to average total deposits, remuneration to total assets and gross domestic product have positive effect on interest rate spreads. However, non-interest income to average total assets, <b>treasury</b> <b>certificate</b> and development stocks have negative relationship with interest rate spreads. In general, the findings that suggest a reduction in cash reserve ratio, high bank overhead costs amongst others will help to moderate the high interest rate spreads in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|Money market {{provides}} {{instruments for}} effective liquidity management and {{acts as the}} core source of raising short-term funds for lubricating economic activities in any nation. This study seeks to empirically explore developments in Money market operations and Economic viability in Nigeria. Economic viability is proxied by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and represents the explained variable. Core Money market instruments commonly used in Nigeria such as Treasury bills (TB), <b>Treasury</b> <b>Certificate</b> (TC), Certificate of Deposit (CD), Commercial Papers (CP) and Banker Acceptances (BA) served as the explanatory variables. The data used for empirical estimation covered the period 1981 to 2011 and were sourced from CBN statistical Bulletin, 2011. Analysis of data was carried out using Multiple Regression technique parameters. Research findings were robust. The variation in the growth trends of GDP and the explanatory variables in a graphic representation appear to cast doubts on whether Money market operations {{made significant contributions to}} GDP in the period under review. However, the results from Pearson correlation coefficient matrix substantially attest to strong linear relationship between the explained and explanatory variables. Besides, the summary statistics of the model as indicated by the Coefficient of determination (R 2) and ANOVA F-Statistics showed that the estimated model passed the test of overall significance at all significant levels, implying that a long run relationship exist...|$|E

It is important to notice that the implicit interest rates have been widely employed in the literature on market discipline due to data limitations; it is complicated to find data directly describing the interest rate on deposits. To evaluate the performance of IIRDE, I compare it with the 28  days CETES (Mexican Federal <b>Treasury</b> <b>Certificates).</b>|$|R
50|$|The general public, {{accustomed}} to metallic currency, avoided the paper money. To make matters worse, the notes were easily counterfeited. They rapidly fell in value until 100 pesos in paper was worth only 16 pesos in gold. The notes {{were used to}} pay the troops, but this stopped when soldiers began deserting. Finally, the government agreed (2 April 1813) to exchange the notes for <b>treasury</b> <b>certificates</b> paying 5% and renewable every four months. The copper coins, on the other hand, were well received and continued to be produced until 1815.|$|R

In the next period mainly internal sources will be taken into consideration, both for the reduction of the costs with the internal debt and for the reduction of the foreign currency course risk belonging to the governmental debt. The main objective of the governmental debt is represented by its maintenance in the sustainable limits and ensuring the sources necessary for the financing the budget deficits and the payment resources of the debt ´ service at the lowest acceptable risk. One of the objective of the public debt for the period 2008 - 2010 is represented also by the development of the state titles, in this respect, in insuring the financing on the internal market taking into consideration launching long and medium benchmark type emissions, that could be re-opened in order to increase their liquidity.

50|$|War {{savings stamps}} were {{issued by the}} United States Treasury Department to help fund {{participation}} in World War I and World War II. Although these stamps were distinct from the postal savings stamps issued by the United States Post Office Department, the Post Office nevertheless {{played a major role}} in promoting and distributing war savings stamps. In contrast to Liberty Bonds, which were purchased primarily by financial institutions, war savings stamps were principally aimed at common citizens. During World War I, 25-cent Thrift stamps were offered to allow individuals to accumulate enough over time to purchase the standard 5-dollar War Savings Certificate stamp. When the Treasury began issuing war savings stamps during World War II, the lowest denomination was a 10-cent stamp, enabling ordinary citizens to purchase them. In many cases, collections of war savings stamps could be redeemed for <b>Treasury</b> <b>Certificates</b> or War Bonds.|$|R
40|$|For 2009 as a whole, this quarter’s {{consensus}} outlook anticipates a steep {{decline of}} 6. 9 percent in real {{gross domestic product}} (GDP). This outlook for inflation-adjusted GDP is not surprising given the panelists expectations for private consumption, as consumers are expected to reduce expenditures by 6. 5 percent this year alone. Projections for the government stimulus package have declined substantially, however, with government consumption growth expected to slow to less than 1 percent. Diminished confidence in the Mexican business sector is still expected to cause total fixed investment to shrink at double digit rates. Given the lingering effects of the global economic downturn, the panelists also expect imports and exports to display steep contractions in excess of 11 and 22 percent, respectively. The 2009 consensus figure calls for consumer price increase in excess of 4 percent. Against this backdrop, the panelists expect a 2009 average exchange rate of 13. 42 pesos per dollar. The consensus outlook for the 2009 yield on 28 -day <b>Treasury</b> <b>Certificates</b> (CETES) holds steady at 5. 5 percent, again, this quarter. ...|$|R

40|$|The Mexican {{domestic}} securities markets {{date back to}} 1978, when short term fixed rate notes were issued for the first time. 1 Over the years, the Banco de Mexico (Banxico) has worked to develop {{a wide range of}} government instruments to provide a foundation for conducting monetary policy and for financing the public budget. The Tequila Crisis in 1994 / 5 had a salutary effect on the government securities market; it resulted in a shift toward improved fiscal discipline, which in turn has impacted positively various areas including the spread of maturities, regulatory environment, and the creation of benchmark issues. Instruments The primary government issued securities in Mexico are: • Zero coupon short term federal <b>treasury</b> <b>certificates</b> (Cetes); • 3 year or 5 year floating rate bonds with interest payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (Bondes); • 3, 5 and 10 year fixed rate bonds with interest payable semiannually (Bonos); • 5 and 10 year fixed rate inflation indexed bonds with interest payable semiannually (Udibonos); 2 and • Bonds issued abroad with interest payable semiannually (United Mexican States or UMS bonds). All bonds are peso denominated save for the UMS series. UMS bonds are also noteworthy in that they serve as the benchmark for the international community as they are geared toward external investors. In addition to the government issued securities, Banxico began to issue its own debt instruments (Brems) in 2000, which are 1 and 3 year floating rate bonds. Moreover, the deposit insurance agency issues floating rate debt with government guarantees. 3...|$|R

25|$|The first paper bank {{notes were}} gold certificates. They were first issued in the 17th century {{when they were}} used by goldsmiths in England and the Netherlands for {{customers}} who kept deposits of gold bullion in their vault for safe-keeping. Two centuries later, the gold certificates began being issued in the United States when the US <b>Treasury</b> issued such <b>certificates</b> that could be exchanged for gold. The United States Government first authorized {{the use of the}} gold certificates in 1863. On April 5, 1933 the US Government restricted the private gold ownership in the United States and therefore, the gold certificates stopped circulating as money (this restriction was reversed on January 1, 1975).

Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, National Bank Note, silver <b>certificate,</b> <b>Treasury</b> or [...] "Coin" [...] Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. $2 bills are seldom seen in circulation {{as a result of}} banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends and occasionally has created problems for people trying to use the bill to make purchases.|$|R

50|$|Until 2006, these Treasury Notes {{were issued}} by the Bank of England, in the City of London. The British Treasury would manage its cash and ensure that {{adequate}} funds were available. London's banks and other financial institutions would bid for these instruments, at a discount, specifying which day the following week they wanted the bills issued. Maturities would be for one, three, six, or theoretically but not practically, twelve months. The tenders were for the face value of the Treasury Notes, less a discount, which represented the interest rate. This system {{was replaced by a}} computerised system by the Debt Management Office, which is an Executive Agency of the Treasury, and the last Treasury Notes were printed in September 2003. These notes would often get traded to other banks, so they did circulate; this was done without the Bank of England's knowledge, and the notes would be redeemed by the bank on their date of maturity by the bearer. This circulating nature of the notes led to the robbery on 2 May 1990, of John Goddard, a messenger for the firm Sheppards, with £292 million in <b>Treasury</b> bills and <b>certificates</b> of deposit having been stolen. All but two of these have been recovered.|$|R
50|$|In 1920, the <b>Treasury</b> issued gold <b>certificate</b> notes. The {{following}} year, the South African Reserve Bank {{was established}} {{as the sole}} note issuing authority. Coins were issued from 1923. The South African pound remained equal to the pound sterling throughout its existence, except {{for a short period}} following the abandonment of the gold standard in the United Kingdom in 1931. When the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, Canada quickly followed suit because it had been under exactly the same pressure as the United Kingdom. The contraction of the money supply in the United States had been causing large amounts of gold bullion to flow west across the Atlantic Ocean, and south into the United States. The situation in South Africa was different, because gold exportation to London was a major business. According to Jan Smuts in his biography, the Nationalists specifically wanted to make a point of not automatically following suit with the United Kingdom, and they perceived that they were in a strong position to do so. For the United Kingdom and Canada, an outflow of gold was seen as a flight of gold, whereas for South Africa the same was seen as a profitable enterprise. The effect of South Africa's continuing adherence to the gold standard did not however turn out as Hertzog might have hoped. The South African pound rose dramatically in value against the pound sterling, and this virtually crippled South Africa's gold export industry overnight. By 1933, Hertzog abandoned the gold standard and the South African pound returned to parity with the pound sterling. The relief was felt almost immediately.|$|R
