5|$|Belonging to Kashyapa gotra, Mahavira {{was born}} into the royal Kshatriya family of King Siddhartha and Queen Trishala of the Ikshvaku dynasty. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> solar dynasty in which Hindu epics place Rama and the Ramayana, and in which the Buddhist texts place the Buddha, and the Jains {{attribute}} another twenty-one of their twenty-four Tirthankaras over millions of years.|$|E

5|$|Starting 260million years ago, the yellowish-gray {{limestone}} of the fossil-rich Kaibab Limestone {{was laid}} {{down as a}} limy ooze in a tropical climate. During this time, sponges, such as Actinocoelia meandrina, proliferated, only {{to be buried in}} lime mud and their internal silica needles (spicules) dissolved and recrystallized to form discontinuous layers of light-colored chert. In the park, this formation {{can be found in the}} Hurricane Cliffs above the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center and in an escarpment along Interstate 15 as it skirts the park. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{names were}} used for named storms in the North Atlantic in 2005. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2011 season. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> list used in the 1999 season. The names Franklin, Lee, Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince and Wilma {{were used for}} Atlantic storms {{for the first time}} in 2005. Also, the 2005 season ran out of named storms so they used letters of the Greek Alphabet such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Zeta.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{group that}} set up and {{maintained}} the in-house digital ink and paint systems for Hanna Barbera {{as well as the}} Avid and Pro Tools systems used in Post Production. The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. Real Adventures maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring off-screen deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing. The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.|$|E

5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E
