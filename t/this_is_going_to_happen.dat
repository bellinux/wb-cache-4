5000|$|On 20 September 2011, two trucks {{containing}} 35 {{dead bodies}} were found at an underpass near a shopping mall in Boca del Río, Veracruz. All of the corpses were alleged {{to be members of}} Los Zetas, but it was later proven that only six of them had been involved in minor crime incidents, and none of them was involved with organized crime. Some of the victims had their hands tied and showed signs of having been tortured. According to El Universal, at around 17:00 an undetermined number of vehicles blocked a major avenue in Boca del Río. Once the traffic stopped, armed men abandoned two trucks {{in the middle of the}} highway. They opened the doors of the trucks and pulled out the thirty-five corpses, leaving a written message behind. Other gunmen pointed their weapons at the frightened drivers. The gunmen then fled the scene. Consequently, the stunned motorists began to grab their cellphones and post messages on Twitter warning other drivers to avoid the area.

5000|$|The {{premise is}} that mankind is {{actually}} alien to the planet earth. And that we came here on a quest for this ultimate knowledge that these beings called the Setians had. They were the true inhabitants of earth {{and they are the}} direct descendants of God or the grand architect of the universe. So they have all of the answers as to why things are the way they are. And human beings were after this unlimited power. So they come to planet earth and they basically wipe out the civilisation of the setians -this is all in ‘Framing Armageddon’- and that story takes place from the point of invasion up until the birth of Set. The first part is a 10.000 year period. Before the invasion, the Setians see in a prophecy that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> So they send 10.000 of their own chosen people to go into hiding to survive the attacks of the humans. And until after this event called “the clouding” which is where the earth goes through this cataclysmic shift like the magnetic properties of the polar caps shift and volcanoes erupt and there’s earthquakes and sandstorms and the whole of earth goes haywire. At this point, the human beings believe that they have wiped out all of the Setians and they go through the days of clouding. When the days of clouding are over, they have lost their memories of where they came from and why they are here. And so this whole invasion armada that came, all the ships and other evidence has been buried in the desert. So they wake up and what was once a lush green land with water is now a desert. So the 10.000 come out of hiding after the days of clouding and they now look like human beings. Setians are humanoid anyway but they have different features, they can morph and shift and look exactly like humans. Another thing that happens after the days of clouding is like the story of the tower of Babel: the human beings that have similar skin colours can speak to each other. This creates confusion because now the white guys can talk to each other and the red guys can, but they can’t talk to guys with a different colour. Then they start to faction off. This is a way to keep people divided. It’s all part of the plan of the clouding. And when the Setians come back in and mix with humans, they take leadership positions and they spread around the planet, societies grow. But the whole time they are being manipulated by the Setian leaders. They build up the order of the Rose. This is a lodge, like a philanthropic organisation that is supposed to be different, doing good for the world and for humanity. And for the whole time they are actually plotting the destruction of mankind. Every empire that rises and falls, it all happens by their design. You could say, for instance, that {{the rise and fall of}} the Roman Empire was by the design of the Setians. And all of the religions of the world were created by the Setians as well, because all these things help keep mankind divided, they thrive on the weaknesses of man in order to bring us to our demise.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{immediate}} responses designed to defuse this category. First, {{it will be}} argued that the Technological Project is itself at fault and that humanity should embrace the GAIA world view and cease and desist immediately from using the products and services of the Technological Project. I do not think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> because (a) there are serious intellectual problems with the GAIA hypothesis, (b) we need the Technological Project to promote awareness of environmental issues, and (c) most especially it is too late to reject the Technological Project because modernity is committed to the faith in technology – that is, we assume and act on the assumption that future technology will solve the problems created by the older technology. So, for example, the creation of driverless cars will enable us to overcome the irresponsible driving habits of some drivers. This will, in turn, create a new set of problems – e.g., the malfunction of computers that direct such cars. A deep look into the modern world will reveal that it is too late to go back. There is a significant difference between responsible engagement with the environment and a wholesale rejection of the Technological Project.|$|E

40|$|Retention of {{students}} at colleges and universities {{has long been a}} concern for educators for many decades. The consequences of student attrition are significant for both students, academic staffs and the overall institution. Thus, increasing student retention is a long term goal of any academic institution. The most vulnerable students at all institutions of higher education are the freshman students, who are at the highest risk of dropping out {{at the beginning of their}} study. Consequently, the early identification of at-risk students is a crucial task that needs to be addressed precisely. In this thesis, we develop a framework for early prediction of student success using survival analysis approach. We propose time-dependent Cox (TD-Cox), which is based on the Cox proportional hazard regression model and also captures time-varying factors to address the challenge of predicting dropout students as well as the semester that the dropout will occur, to enable proactive interventions. This is critical in student retention problem because not only correctly classifying whether student is going to dropout is important but also when <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> is crucial to investigate. We evaluate our method on real student data collected at Wayne State University. The results show that the proposed Cox-based framework can predict the student dropout and the semester of dropout with high accuracy and precision compared to the other alternative state-of-the-art methods...|$|E

Much less clear to most of us are the hows, whens and whys of the change. In this paper, we will attempt to analyze the mechanisms and dynamics of the coming cultural revolution, focusing on the «artistic space» where the revolution is taking place, on the interactions between the artistic act and the space in which the act takes place and on {{the way in which the}} act modifies the space and the space the act. We briefly discuss the new category of «electronic artists». We then highlight what we see as the logical process connecting the past, the present and our uncertain future. We examine the relationship between art and previous technologies, pointing to the evolutionary, as well as the revolutionary impact of new means of expression. Against this background we propose a definition for what we call «Alive Art», going on to develop a tentative profile of the performers (the «Alivers»). In the last section, we describe two examples of Alive Artworks, pointing out the central role of what we call the "Alive Art Effect" in which we can perceive relative independence of creation from the artist and thus it may seem that unique creative role of artist is not always immediate and directly induced by his/her activity. We actually, emphasized that artist's activities may result in unpredictable processes more or less free of the artist's will...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Smoking {{prevalence}} differs significantly across Europe. In addition, {{there are}} considerable differences in tobacco control activities across European countries. The relationship between prevalence and policy is under-researched. The present analysis examines {{the motivation to}} change smoking behaviour across 5 different European countries that differ considerably in their tobacco control activities. Methods A population-based, representative survey of 1750 smokers, aged 16 – 59, from 5 different European countries (Germany, Greece, Poland, Sweden, UK) was used. Demographic variables, smoking status and the motivation to stop smoking were assessed. Motivation was assessed as, first, intending to quit (using the stages of change plus a modified stage for Precontemplation), and second, the desire to quit. Results The majority of smokers want to stop smoking (73. 5 %), while only 35. 0 % want to stop definitely. Across countries, 10. 2 % definitely {{do not want to}} stop. Most of the smokers can be categorised in the Precontemplation stage (between 62. 6 % and 77. 7 % depending on the country), one of the stages of change categories. The relationship between the stages of change and the country under examination is statistically significant (chi-square = 43. 466, p Conclusion There are differences in the stages of change between the countries under examination. However, the categorisation of the countries into low, medium and high tobacco control activity used in this analysis does not explain these differences. Most smokers want to stop smoking, but a high proportion cannot indicate a time-frame when <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Tobacco control efforts or other kinds of support might encourage these smokers to actually try to stop. Longitudinal studies at the population level are needed to assess, relate or monitor tobacco control activities and the intention to stop. </p...|$|E
