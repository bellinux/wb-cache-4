25|$|One {{apparent}} {{disadvantage of}} <b>twist-lock</b> connectors {{is that in}} the event that the cable is accidentally pulled too hard, rather than the plug falling out of the receptacle, exposed conductors may come out of the plug, causing dangerous shorts or shock hazards if the circuit is live. This is resolved in most cases by the connector having a robust integral strain relief.|$|E
25|$|Plug and socket systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or polyphase industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the security and safety of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a locking ring or <b>twist-lock</b> feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local safety disconnecting switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection. Plugs used for equipment in wet locations (such as mines) may include small supervisory contacts that check {{the integrity of the}} earthing conductor.|$|E
2500|$|The Shelby GT500KR {{features}} a {{carbon fiber composite}} hood with functional scoops and vents, <b>twist-lock</b> hood pins modeled on the original 1968 KR, a unique carbon fiber splitter, carbon fiber mirror caps, and functional brake cooling ducts. The suspension was tuned by SVT with unique spring rates, dampers, stabilizer bars, and strut tower brace and was sourced from Ford Racing. Unique Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires were developed for the KR with a unique compound. With the same tread pattern as the Eagle F1 Supercar tire on the 2007–2009 GT500 they can only be identified by a unique Goodyear [...] "Wingedfoot" [...] emblem on the sidewall.|$|E

5000|$|The {{electric}} foil contains a socket underneath the guard that {{connects to the}} scoring apparatus via the body cord and a wire that runs down a channel cut {{into the top of}} the blade. Electric foil sockets are fixed so that the body cord plugs into the weapon at the fencer's wrist. There are two main varieties of socket in use today: the two-prong variety which has unequal diameter prongs and is held in place by a retaining clip, and the single-prong [...] "bayonette" [...] which <b>twist-locks</b> into place.|$|R
50|$|The IP67 variant {{includes}} a gasket and <b>twist-lock</b> ring which seals the two together.|$|E
50|$|A {{consequence}} {{of these early}} modifications is that the lens mount became <b>twist-lock</b> instead of breach-lock; the lens is inserted and turned.|$|E
50|$|While G {{actually}} indicates bi-pin, those {{listed above}} have a <b>twist-lock,</b> but with parallel pins {{from the end}} instead of opposing pins on the side.|$|E
50|$|A GU24 {{lamp fitting}} is a bi-pin {{connector}} for {{compact fluorescent lamps}} (CFL) or LED lamps that uses a bayonet mount-like <b>twist-lock</b> bi-pin connector instead of the Edison screw fitting used on many incandescent light bulbs.|$|E
5000|$|Carabiners {{exist in}} various forms; {{the shape of}} the {{carabiner}} and the type of gate varies according to the use for which it is intended. There are two major varieties: locking and non-locking carabiners. Locking carabiners offer a method of preventing the gate from opening when in use. Locking carabiners are used for important connections, such as at the anchor point or a belay device. There are several different types of locking carabiners, including a <b>twist-lock</b> and a thread-lock. <b>Twist-lock</b> carabiners are commonly referred to as [...] "auto-locking carabiners" [...] due to their spring-loaded locking mechanism. Non-locking carabiners are commonly found as a component of quickdraws.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} {{configurations}} of NEMA plug and socket: straight-blade and locking. Numbers prefixed by L are <b>twist-lock,</b> others are straight blade. Locking type connectors are found mostly in industrial applications and are not common in residential and light commercial use.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{systems are}} used to secure {{containers}} aboard ships, depending on {{factors such as the}} type of ship, the type of container, and the location of the container. [...] Stowage inside the holds of fully cellular (FC) ships is simplest, typically using simple metal forms called container guides, locating cones, and anti-rack spacers to lock the containers together. [...] Above-decks, without the extra support of the cell guides, more complicated equipment is used. [...] Three types of systems are currently in wide use: lashing systems, locking systems, and buttress systems. [...] Lashing systems secure containers to the ship using devices made from wire rope, rigid rods, or chains and devices to tension the lashings, such as turnbuckles. [...] The effectiveness of lashings is increased by securing containers to each other, either by simple metal forms (such as stacking cones) or more complicated devices such as <b>twist-lock</b> stackers. [...] A typical <b>twist-lock</b> is inserted into the casting hole of one container and rotated to hold it in place, then another container is lowered on top of it. [...] The two containers are locked together by twisting the device's handle. [...] A typical <b>twist-lock</b> is constructed of forged steel and ductile iron and has a shear strength of 48 metric tons.|$|E
5000|$|In North America for {{moderate}} current requirements the 50 A California style connector {{is commonly}} used. It features a <b>twist-lock</b> design {{with a metal}} sleeve full protecting the blades on the male connector and a center ground spike on the female connector to aid in centering.|$|E
50|$|Screw-lock (or screw gate): Have a {{threaded}} sleeve over the gate {{which must be}} engaged and disengaged manually. They have fewer moving parts than spring-loaded mechanisms, are less prone to malfunctioning due to contamination or component fatigue, easier to employ one-handed. They, however, require more total effort and are more time-consuming than pull-lock, <b>twist-lock</b> or lever-lock.|$|E
50|$|One {{apparent}} {{disadvantage of}} <b>twist-lock</b> connectors {{is that in}} the event that the cable is accidentally pulled too hard, rather than the plug falling out of the receptacle, exposed conductors may come out of the plug, causing dangerous shorts or shock hazards if the circuit is live. This is resolved in most cases by the connector having a robust integral strain relief.|$|E
50|$|<b>Twist-lock,</b> push-lock, twist-and-push-lock: Have a {{security}} sleeve over the gate {{which must be}} manually rotated and/or pulled to disengage, but which springs automatically to locked position upon release. They offer the advantage of re-engaging without additional user input, but being spring-loaded are prone to both spring fatigue and their more complex mechanisms becoming balky from dirt, ice, or other contamination. They are also difficult to engage one-handed and with gloves on.|$|E
50|$|Épée body cords {{consist of}} {{two sets of}} three prongs each {{connected}} by a wire. One set plugs into the fencer's weapon, with the other connecting to the reel. Foil and sabre body cords have only two prongs (or a <b>twist-lock</b> bayonet connector) on the weapon side, with the third wire connecting instead to the fencer's lamé. The need in foil and sabre to distinguish between on and off-target touches requires a wired connection to the valid target area.|$|E
5000|$|The bonnet {{was widely}} rumoured {{to be sealed}} [...] - [...] Car and Driver wrote: [...] "...feature of the A2 that may foretell the future: the sealed hood". Actually, the bonnet is easily removed, being {{held in place by}} two <b>twist-lock</b> catches. The bonnet, {{weighing}} 8 kg, then comes away from the car altogether, unlike the usual hinged flip-up arrangement on most other cars. Due to the service hatch, the bonnet {{does not need to be}} removed frequently for access to the engine.|$|E
50|$|The M175 {{was their}} first product, {{released}} in 2008. It was designed to output 175 Watts of AC power, but is capable of up to 5% over that. The M175 was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box, similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles. Wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a <b>twist-lock</b> connection. A limited number of M210 models, {{based on the same}} generation system, were also available for a limited time.|$|E
50|$|The suffix {{after the}} G {{indicates}} the pin spread; the G {{dates to the}} use of Glass for the original bulbs. GU usually also indicates that the lamp provides a mechanism for physical support by the luminaire: in some cases, each pin has two diameters, being larger near the ends, in order to <b>twist-lock</b> into position in the socket (the transition between the two diameters is a right-angle step rather than a taper); in others, the base of the lamp has a groove which can be held by a spring or clip.|$|E
50|$|Twist-locking {{connectors}} {{were first}} invented by Harvey Hubbell III in 1938 and <b>Twist-Lock</b> remains a registered trademark of Hubbell Incorporated to this day, although the term {{tends to be}} used generically to refer to NEMA twist-locking connectors manufactured by any company. Twist-locking connectors all use curved blades that have shapes that conform to portions of the circumference of a circle. Once pushed into the receptacle, the plug is twisted and its now-rotated prongs latch into the receptacle. To unlatch the plug, the rotation is reversed. The locking coupling makes for a very reliable connection in commercial and industrial settings.|$|E
50|$|Many theatres {{also use}} Edison plugs, {{which are the}} {{standard}} connector used in homes and businesses in North America, because of their availability {{and the ability to}} connect household fixtures to a theatrical control system. <b>Twist-lock</b> connectors are used in many theatres because of their locking feature, which will not allow fixtures to become accidentally disconnected. Connectors used to power lighting fixtures must be rated at 20 amperes or higher, depending on local electrical codes. Temporary high-power distribution wiring often employs camlock connectors to connect dimming equipment, power distribution units, controllers for motorized chain hoists, and other high-power equipment to a company switch, generator, or other tie-in point.|$|E

50|$|Employees John Meyer and Bob Cavin {{created an}} active speaker system in 1971 {{known as the}} JM-3, named for John Meyer. This was a three-way, tri-amped system that {{enclosed}} the power amplifiers {{and all of the}} integrated electronics associated with the loudspeakers in an external equipment rack with few or no controls, the settings having all been calibrated at the shop. The fully horn-loaded system was used on CCR's final tour. The amplifier enclosure also included preset crossover filters, limiters and equalization. The outside of the amplifier rack was simple: a two-circuit AC power cable connection, XLR connectors for input audio signal, and two 4-pin female <b>twist-lock</b> NEMA L14-30 connectors for carrying the amplified 3-way audio signal to two JM-3 loudspeakers.|$|E
5000|$|Harvey Hubbell III soon {{showed that}} he had {{inherited}} his father's twin acumen for product innovation and business development. In product innovation, he devised the Company's lines of <b>Twist-Lock</b> industrial connectors with new 2-,3-,and 4-wire devices of various ratings, designed a whole new series of locking connectors for industrial use which he named [...] "Hubbellock", and introduced heavy-duty, circuit-breaking devices. The Company played a large part in the war effort by meeting the demand for electrical components and systems to power the nation's industries and by developing products for the special applications needed by military. These included components for military vehicle electrical circuits, battery-charging systems for M-4 tanks, power jacks for test meters, vacuum tube sockets for radio communications, and a line of electrical and electronic connectors for aircraft. The Company's {{years of experience in}} building devices reliable enough for industrial use was a valuable asset in the production of products which could perform under rugged battlefield conditions.A second plant was opened in Lexington, Kentucky, {{in order to meet the}} demand and as a safety measure since the main plant in Bridgeport was considered vulnerable to air or sea attack.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two <b>twist-lock</b> cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} three-dimensional pose estimation {{model for}} object with complex surface, which primarily absorbs {{the essence of}} scale-invariant feature transform and iterative closest point algorithm, includes two steps, off-line and online. At first, two kinds of feature databases are established in the off-line operations. Then, the online process mainly has three steps. The first one is two-dimensional edge extraction from red–green–blue (RGB) information based on scale-invariant feature transform algorithm. The second one is three-dimensional surface reconstruction from the previous two-dimensional edge and the depth information obtained from depth camera. The last one is three-dimensional pose estimation based on camera calibration and iterative closest point algorithm. The Kinect camera is selected as the information acquisition device which can produce red–green–blue information and depth information. In the experiment, the container <b>twist-lock</b> with complex surface is taken as the object. The result shows that {{the accuracy of the}} proposed model is very high...|$|E
