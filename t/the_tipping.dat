5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal room in a section called <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A thick tip foil blade was {{designed}} to reduce <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> leakage flow and weaken <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> vortexes in ducted propeller 19 A/Ka 4 - 55. <b>The</b> thick <b>tip</b> foil was constructed by normal extrusion of <b>the</b> original <b>tip</b> foil. <b>The</b> maximum thickness of the foil increased from 1. 64 % chord length to 7. 64 %. The commercial CFD code CFX was employed to simulate the flow field of the two ducted propellers. From the performance curves, it could be concluded that <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> foil thickening will not affect the thrust and torque of the ducted propeller much. <b>The</b> <b>tip</b> leakage vortex (TLV) in <b>the</b> thick <b>tip</b> foil propeller was obviously weaker than that in the original propeller. The pressure drop in TLV middle chord position decreased by 32. 8 %. In <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance, both propellers have <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance vortex. <b>The</b> difference is that <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance vortex in <b>the</b> thick <b>tip</b> foil propeller could form an expansionary channel in <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> clearance, which made <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> leakage flow slow down, and hence weaken the TLV...|$|R
25|$|Dip-pen {{nanolithography}} is {{a process}} that uses an atomic force microscope to transfer molecules on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to a substrate. Initially <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> is dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to <b>the</b> <b>tip.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> is brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> and <b>the</b> surface resulting in the diffusion of molecules from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> to <b>the</b> surface. These <b>tips</b> can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|R
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack.

Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth.

5|$|The Ojo de Agua Raid was {{the last}} {{important}} military engagement between Mexican Seditionistas and the United States Army. It took place at Ojo de Agua, Texas. As part of the Plan of San Diego, the rebels launched a raid across the Rio Grande into Texas on October 21, 1915 aimed at harassing the American outposts along the Mexican border and disrupting the local economy. After moving across the border, the Seditionistas began an assault against the United States Army Signal Corps station at Ojo de Agua. The small group of American defenders was cornered into a single building and suffered heavy casualties before reinforcements arrived driving the Seditionist force back into Mexico. The raid proved to be <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> point in the American conflict with the Seditionistas, as its severity convinced American officials to send large numbers of American troops to the area in order to deter any further serious border raids by the Mexican force.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  4 a, <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> is {{initially}} placed above the vacancy site with <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> height of 8  Å {{at which the}} tip-surface interaction is almost negligible.

When <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> reaches <b>the</b> height of 7.1  Å, as demonstrated in Figure  4 b, the dopant atom shows an obvious movement toward the up terrace since the attraction is strong enough.

40|$|We present first-principles total-energy electronic-structure {{calculations}} {{that provide}} the microscopic mechanism of the Ag atom diffusion between the half unit cells (HUCs) on the Si(111) -(7 x 7) surface with and without <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of <b>the</b> atomic force microscope (AFM). We find that, without the presence of <b>the</b> AFM <b>tip,</b> <b>the</b> diffusions between the two HUCs are almost symmetric with the energy barrier of about 1 eV in the both directions. The diffusion is a two-step process with an intermediate metastable configuration in which the Ag atom is at the boundary of the HUCs.
