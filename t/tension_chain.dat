40|$|It {{is known}} that {{terraces}} at the air-polymer interface of lamella forming diblock copolymers do not make discontinuous jumps in height. Despite the underlying discretized structure, the height profiles are smoothly varying. The width of a transition region of a terrace edge in isolation is typically several hundreds of nanometres, resulting from a balance between surface <b>tension,</b> <b>chain</b> stretching penalties, and the enthalpy of mixing. What is less well known in these systems {{is what happens when}} two transition regions interact with one another. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of the interactions between copolymer lamellar edges. We find that the data can be well described by a model that assumes a repulsion between adjacent edges. While the model is simplistic, and does not include molecular level details, its agreement with the data suggest that some of the the underlying assumptions provide insight into the complex interplay between defects...|$|E

An older derailleur-equipped bicycle with horizontal dropouts can be readily converted into singlespeed, fixed gear or to use an internally geared hub.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kinetic {{characteristics}} of chain drive system were investigated {{in this paper}} and some corresponding mathematical models were established. In accordance with the theory of chain drive, based on the multi-body dynamics software platform, a dynamic analysis model of timing bushing chain system for diesel engine was established. <b>Chain</b> <b>tension</b> force, <b>chain</b> contact force and chain fluctuation in a rotation cycle at different running speeds were analyzed. By analysis and evaluation these results, the kinematic and dynamic {{characteristics of}} the chain drive system during the operation could be effectively recognized, this research results can {{provide a basis for}} production tests. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT is choked {{using two}} small choking pulleys. Here one choking pulley is positioned on the tense {{side of the}} chain of the iCVT. Hence there is a considerable load on that choking pulley, the magnitude of which {{is proportional to the}} <b>tension</b> in its <b>chain.</b> Each choking pulley is pulled up by two chain segments, one chain segment to the left and one {{to the right of the}} choking pulley; here if the two chain segments are parallel to each other, then the load on the choking pulley is twice the <b>tension</b> in the <b>chain.</b> But since the two chain segments are most likely not parallel to each other during operations of an iCVT, it is estimated that the load on a choking pulley is between 1 and 1.8 times of the <b>tension</b> of its <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to the device often used on tandem {{bicycles}} with timing chains, single-speed bicycles with a rear disc brake or an internal-geared hub, or any bicycle with vertical dropouts and no derailleur, to allow slight repositioning, fore and aft, of a bottom bracket in order to properly <b>tension</b> the <b>chain.</b>|$|R

50|$|Brunel {{was known}} for his {{distrust}} of cast iron as a material, at least for large beams. This distrust of cast iron was vindicated when his friend Stephenson's adventurous cast-iron Dee Bridge (1846) collapsed in 1847. Brunel gave evidence in his support at the following inquiry, but this was on the basis of Stephenson being a competent engineer within the bounds of current knowledge, rather than in support of large cast-iron beams. Stephenson's Dee Bridge had used a truss girder, where an inverted T-shaped cast iron girder was trussed by applied wrought iron tension bars. This faulty design was instrumental in the bridge failure, where tension in the truss rods increased compression in {{the upper part of the}} girder such that it underwent columnar failure. Despite this, although with the advantage of hindsight, Brunel would use similar applied <b>tension</b> <b>chains</b> for his truss design.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chain is}} a [...] {{assembly}} of connected pieces, called links, typically made of metal, {{with an overall}} character {{similar to that of}} a rope in that it is flexible and curved in compression but linear, rigid, and load-bearing in <b>tension.</b> A <b>chain</b> may consist of three or more links. Chains can be classified by their design, which is dictated by their use: ...|$|R
5000|$|Lucien Juy owned {{a bicycle}} shop in Dijon, Côte d'Or, France. [...] It {{was there that}} he made the first Simplex {{derailleur}} in 1928. The bicycle historian Hilary Stone said: [...] "It used a single pulley to <b>tension</b> the <b>chain</b> {{and a pair of}} guide plates to push the chain to each one of two sprockets. The whole arm was spring-loaded in order to <b>tension</b> the <b>chain</b> - this was the first use of the sprung top pivot which was to become {{an essential part of the}} modern indexed derailleur as we know it today. The pulley and guide plates were moved sideways on a push-rod by means of a chain pulling through the centre of the push-rod. Lucien Juy managed to persuade the management of the Alcyon racing team to fit his Le Simplex gear to their machines for the 1928 Paris-Roubaix - unfortunately the riders revolted and refused to use the new unproven gears." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Ford-issued {{block was}} machined differently to improve strength. In {{place of the}} single-cam arrangement, an endless duplex hydraulically <b>tensioned</b> timing <b>chain</b> was used to drive the overhead cams. The chain measured 2.2 m. The casting and bearings for the standard underhead cam were repurposed for a shaft which drove the oil pump. Ignition was controlled by a EDIS-6 system, which would become a standard feature.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{vertical}} dropouts {{have the}} slot facing downwards. The {{advantage is that}} the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, chain tensioner, or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} motion of a knot along a <b>tensioned</b> <b>chain</b> whose {{backbone}} is corrugated due to excluded volume effects. At low applied tensions, the knot traverses the chain diffusively, while at higher tensions the knot makes slow, discrete hops that {{can be described as}} a Poisson process. In this “jammed” regime, the knot’s long-time diffusivity decreases exponentially with increasing tension. We quantify how these measurements are altered by chain rigidity and the corrugation of the polymer backbone. We also characterize the energy barrier of the reptation moves that gives rise to the knot’s motion. For the simple knot types examined thus far (3 [subscript 1], 4 [subscript 1], 5 [subscript 1], 5 [subscript 2]), the dominant contribution to the energy landscape appears in the first step of reptation—i. e., polymer entering the knotted core. We hope this study gives insight into what physics contributes to the internal friction of highly jammed knots.

50|$|An {{eccentric}} is a {{cylindrical plug}} or bearing cup that fits into an enlarged bottom bracket shell. The plug is machined {{to accept a}} typical bottom bracket, but offset {{from the center of}} the plug, so that by rotating the plug, the location of the bottom bracket (and hence the <b>chain</b> <b>tension)</b> may be adjusted (fore and aft to <b>tension</b> the <b>chain,</b> the upper or lower eccentric position for a given chain length can be chosen to fine tune bottom bracket height). Once properly adjusted the plug is then fixed in place by a pair of set screws, a clamping bottom bracket shell, an expanding wedge in the plug, or the plug may be manufactured in left and right halves that clamp against the faces of the bottom bracket shell with screws that connect the two halves.|$|R

40|$|Armoured face {{conveyors}} (AFCs) {{of length}} even up to 500 meters {{are used in}} coal mines for transportation of run-of-mine. The method of their installation depends on the geological and mining conditions and on a coal seam position. Operation of AFC in a horizontal or inclined position is allowed. The maximum accepted inclination {{is determined by the}} machine manufacturer. Two directions of longitudinal inclination of the conveyor have to be considered: upward and downward transportation of excavated material. Both the angle and the direction of inclination of the conveyor {{have a significant impact on}} the dynamics of its operation. Change in inclination of AFC results in <b>tension</b> of the <b>chain.</b> Loosening the scraper chain can lead to blockage, what can be a reason of damage. Excessive <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> results in speeding up frictional wear of conveyor components. Determination of an impact of longitudinal inclination of the conveyor on a degree and a place of loosening or excessive <b>tension</b> of the <b>chain</b> was the objective of the numerical analyses, the results of which are presented. Analysis were performed using the developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor.
