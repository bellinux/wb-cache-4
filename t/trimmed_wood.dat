50|$|From {{the start}} of {{production}} both models had a decorative, non-structural <b>wood</b> <b>trim</b> on the rear body which gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor Traveller and gave rise to these cars simply being called a woodie.

On Mercuries, the Villager name almost always denotes a top <b>trim,</b> <b>wood</b> grained wagon. Villager was the equal of the Ford designation [...] "Squire". The Mercury equivalent of the more well known Country Squire full-size station wagon was the Colony Park.|$|R

From 1982 to 1988, Chrysler used the Town & Country {{name on a}} station wagon version of the K-based, front wheel drive LeBaron, featuring plastic woodgrain exterior trim with three dimensional simulated framework. As the station wagon declined in North America, manufacturers offered faux <b>wood</b> <b>trim</b> on SUVs and minivans (e.g., the Jeep Cherokee and Chrysler minivans). Chrysler offered simulated wood as an option for the Chrysler PT Cruiser, introduced in 2000â€”and aftermarket firms offered kits as well.|$|R
