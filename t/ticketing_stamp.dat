60|$|Better, I should say, {{take the}} rapido which leaves Madrid {{three times a}} week at nine-thirty in the morning, than the night express which leaves as often at the same hour in the evening. Since there are now such good day trains on the chief Spanish lines, it is flying in the face of Providence not to go by them; they might be {{suddenly}} taken off; besides, they have excellent restaurant-cars, and there is, moreover, always the fascinating and often the memorable landscape which they pass through. By no fault of ours that I can remember, our train was rather crowded; that is, four or five out of the eight places in our corridor compartment were taken, and we were afraid at every stop that more people would get in, though I do not know that it was our anxieties kept them out. For the matter of that, I do not know why I employed an interpreter at Madrid to get my <b>ticket</b> <b>stamped</b> at the ticket-office; it required merely the presentation of the ticket at the window; but the interpreter seemed to wish it and it enabled him to practise his English with me, and I realized that he must live. In a peseta's worth of gratitude he followed us to our carriage, and he did not molest the mozo in putting our bags into the racks, though he hovered about the door till the train started; and it just now occurs to me that he may have thought a peseta was not a sufficient return for his gratitude; he had rendered us no service.|$|R

Baumser and his two friends had come back, all three smoking cigarettes, and looking the better for their visit to the cookshop. The five got into a first-class railway carriage and waited.

50|$|The strippenkaart, {{introduced}} on 1 October 1980 and abolished on 3 November 2011, was {{a ticket}} composed of several strips, to be validated when used. Passengers either validated the ticket {{themselves in a}} machine, or got it stamped by the driver or conductor. The number of strips to be cancelled was always the number of zones travelled plus one, up {{to a maximum of}} 20 strips.

50|$|Many {{locations}} {{still use}} heat-sensitive tickets (and TRA's tourist branches still use Edmondsons), requiring one ticket examiner per fare control. Examiners punch and collect non-magnetic tickets, provide customer information and assistance, troubleshoot AFC malfunctions (e.g. mutilated tickets), and return cancelled (<b>stamped)</b> <b>tickets</b> to passengers requiring proof-of-travel for expense claims. TRA volunteers (with yellow vest) staff some gates. Volunteers, like America's auxiliary police and volunteer firefighters, include carefully selected and specifically trained {{members of the}} public, and retired industry personnel. They assist passengers, sometimes exercising Japanese or English language skills, and report turnstile jumpers and AFC malfunctions to employees. Station management has considerable latitude in determining work scope of volunteers.|$|R

40|$|Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a {{disruptive}} technology that has penetrated almost every facade of modern civilization. RFID is an automated identification system that uses radio frequency waves to transmit data between a tag and a reader. Penetration of RFID in low cost item level tagging is hindered {{due to the}} high price of tags. The high cost of chipped tags stalled many ambitious projects such as low cost and perishable item level tagging for retails, supply chain management, logistics, pharmaceuticals and luggage handling to just name a few. The tag can be made low cost removing the microchip in the tag. The aim is to make the chipless tag that costs sub cents and is compatible with the current Electronic Product Code (EPC) Global standard. A few research groups have been working in the domain of chipless RFID tags. The big challenge of chipless RFID tag development is to incorporate 64 data bits in a half the credit card size real estate. Recently reported chipless RFID tags can meet neither the bit nor the real estate requirement. The thesis has presented numerous microwave passive designs to develop compact chipless tags with high data capacity. The goal is to develop fully printable uniplanar chipless RFID tags that offer: (i) high spectral efficiency meaning maximum number of data bits possible in the ultra-wide band (UWB) frequency range from 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz, (ii) high spatial efficiency meaning very compact design of multiple data encoding elements in prescribed surface area of the tag, and (iii) operational flexibility such as orientation insensitive tag design. To fulfil the thesis goal a set of high data capacity, spectrally efficient and compact chipless tags are designed. The designed chipless tags are: (i) polarization diversity (PD) based re-transmission type tag; (ii) dual-band modified complementary split ring resonator (MCSRR) based tag; (iii) single polarized radar cross section (RCS) based tag, (iv) dual polarized RCS based tag, (v) multi-dimensional data encoding (MDDE) based tag and (vi) polarization insensitive (PI) tag. To realize the aforementioned chipless tags, a number of compact resonant structures with different polarization attributes, such as single polarized, dual polarized and polarization insensitive, have been proposed. A chipless RFID tag reader is also developed to read the designed tags in a laboratory setting. Successful reading of the designed tags using the developed reader has been accomplished for both mono-static and bi-static tag reading arrangements. The developed chipless RFID system finds potential applications in authentications of Australian polymer banknote and secured documents, tagging of goods and consumables products, bus <b>tickets,</b> <b>stamps,</b> and pharmaceuticals...|$|R
50|$|One {{ticket is}} valid for five (not {{necessarily}} continuous) days (midnight to midnight), within the designated {{period of the}} season (see table below for seasonal periods). It {{can also be used}} by several people simultaneously; for example, five passengers can use entire one sheet of ticket for their one-day trip as a group instead of one passenger traveling individually on five different days. Basically a single sheet of <b>ticket</b> can be <b>stamped</b> for up to 5 times, and a single stamp means unlimited travel for one person for that day. The price of the ticket is 11,850 yen per sheet of 5 tickets, this means 2,370 yen per ticket. This ticket is ideal for long distance travellers, wherein people can get more value for their money.|$|R
