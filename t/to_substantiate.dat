5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
5|$|In 1191, monks at {{the abbey}} {{claimed to have}} found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere {{to the south of}} the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of {{contemporary}} historians including Giraldus Cambrensis. The remains were later moved and were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars suspect that this discovery was a pious forgery <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> the antiquity of Glastonbury's foundation, and increase its renown.|$|E
5|$|Castleshaw Roman fort was a castellum in the Roman {{province}} of Britannia. Although {{there is no}} evidence <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> the claim, {{it has been suggested that}} Castleshaw Roman fort is the site of Rigodunum, a Brigantian settlement. The remains of the fort are located on Castle Hill on the eastern side of Castleshaw Valley at the foot of Standedge but overlooking the valley. The hill is on the edge of Castleshaw in Greater Manchester. The fort was constructed in c.AD79, but fell out of use at some time during the 90s. It was replaced by a smaller fortlet, built in c.105, around which a civilian settlement grew. It may have served as a logistical and administrative centre, although it was abandoned in the 120s.|$|E

5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{hypothesis}} was put forth that argued the impactor {{that killed the}} dinosaurs belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. Concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family. Indeed, it was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature {{as the source of}} the K–Pg impact. Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K–Pg impactor more difficult <b>to</b> <b>substantiate,</b> it does not preclude the possibility. A 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, (WISE), study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80Ma, giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the Earth by 66Ma.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{independent}} effect of single and multiple forms of substantiated childhood maltreatment (CM) on {{quality of life}} (QoL), controlling for selected potential confounders and/or covariates, and concurrent depressive symptoms. Methods: We used data from a prospective pre-birth cohort of 8556 mothers recruited consecutively during their first antenatal clinic visit at the Mater Hospital from 1981 to 1983 in Brisbane, Australia. The data were linked <b>to</b> <b>substantiated</b> cases of CM reported to the child protection government agency up {{to the age of}} 14 years. The sample consisted of 3730 (49. 7 % female) young adults for whom there were complete data on QoL at the 21 -year follow-up. The mean age of participants was 20. 6 years. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between CM and QoL measured at the 21 -year follow-up. Results: There were statistically significant associations between exposure <b>to</b> <b>substantiated</b> CM and poorer QoL. This also applied to the subcategories of childhood physical abuse, childhood emotional abuse (CEA), and neglect. These associations were generally stable after adjusting for confounders/covariates and concurrent depressive symptoms, except physical abuse. CEA with or without neglect significantly and particularly predicted worse subsequent QoL. Conclusions: Exposure <b>to</b> any <b>substantiated</b> maltreatment substantially contributed to worse QoL in young adulthood, with a particular association with CEA and neglect. Prior experiences of CM may have a substantial association with subsequent poorer QoL...|$|R

However, baby Clara Shelley was sick and traveling made her even more ill. She died shortly after arriving in Venice. In the winter of 1818, Percy registered a child in Naples to himself and Mary: Elena Adelaide. However, it is unclear who this child's parents really were.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
5|$|In January 1195 Geoffrey {{was ordered}} to appear in Rome to answer various charges, under the threat of {{suspension}} from office {{if he did not}} appear by 1 June. Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed, including an instance of the cathedral chapter throwing chrism on a dungheap in protest. Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey's projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates once more. This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a legatine council at York in June 1195. Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November, but was still unable to attend, which led Pope Celestine to order that Geoffrey's suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln. Hugh protested, and as a result Celestine himself suspended Geoffrey on 23December 1195, finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him. He travelled to Rome in 1196, where his accusers were unable <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> their claims and he was restored to office by the pope.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{affected}} William, {{since he}} had been appointed chancellor by Raymond and may have fallen out of favour after Raymond {{was removed from the}} regency. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay's supporters. It seems that the canons of the Holy Sepulchre were unable to decide, and asked the king for advice; due to Agnes' influence, Heraclius was elected. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of the Historia, and there is no other evidence <b>to</b> <b>substantiate</b> such a claim. William himself says almost nothing about the election and Heraclius' character or his subsequent patriarchate, probably reflecting his disappointment at the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} findings of historian Carroll Quigley, {{author of the}} 1966 book Tragedy and Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old Right (W.

Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today the Round Table is largely a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.|$|E
