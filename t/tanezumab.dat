Materials and methods: Study 1027 (NCT 01089725), a placebo-controlled trial, evaluated the efficacy of SC <b>tanezumab</b> (ie, 2. 5, 5, and 10 mg) and the therapeutic equivalence of 10  mg <b>tanezumab</b> given subcutaneously versus intravenously every 8 weeks in the symptomatic treatment of OA. Coprimary endpoints were: change from baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) Pain and Physical Function indices, and Patient’s Global Assessment (PGA) of OA. Study 1043 (NCT 00994890) was a long-term, noncontrolled safety study of <b>tanezumab</b> (ie, 2. 5, 5, and 10 mg) subcutaneously administered every 8 weeks. Both studies were discontinued prematurely due to a US Food and Drug Administration partial clinical hold. Results: Due to the clinical hold, Study 1027 was underpowered, and no statistical analyses were performed. Mean (standard error [SE]) change from baseline to week 8 in WOMAC Pain in <b>tanezumab</b> groups ranged from − 3. 59 (0. 26) to − 3. 89 (0. 32), versus − 2. 74 (0. 25) with placebo. Mean (SE) change from baseline to week 8 in WOMAC Physical Function ranged from − 3. 13 (0. 25) to − 3. 51 (0. 28) with <b>tanezumab</b> and was − 2. 26 (0. 24) with placebo. PGA mean (SE) change from baseline to week 8 ranged from − 0. 90 (0. 11) to − 1. 08 (0. 12) with <b>tanezumab</b> and was − 0. 78 (0. 10) with placebo. Similar effectiveness was associated with <b>tanezumab</b> in Study 1043. Few patients in either study (1. 4 %– 5. 2 %) discontinued due to adverse events. Five patients required total joint replacements in Study 1027 (placebo, n= 2 [2. 8 %]; <b>tanezumab</b> 2. 5 mg, n= 3 [4. 1 %]) and 34 patients in Study 1043 (<b>tanezumab</b> 2. 5 mg, n= 11 [4. 8 %]; <b>tanezumab</b> 5 mg, n= 8 [3. 6 %]; <b>tanezumab</b> 10 mg, n= 15 [6. 6 %]). Conclusion: Preliminary results show similar efficacy and safety for both SC and IV administration of <b>tanezumab</b> based on the direct comparisons reported here and indirect comparisons with published results, confirming pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling predictions.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the use of}} <b>tanezumab,</b> a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits nerve growth factor, {{for the treatment of}} moderate to severe osteoarthritis in Japanese patients. DesignPatients received <b>tanezumab</b> 10, 25, 50, 100, 200  μg/kg, or placebo and were followed for 92 or 120 days. Endpoints included the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and the change from baseline to week 8 in pain intensity and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) subscales. ResultsPatients (n =  83) were 69 % female, age 44 – 73 years, with a Kellgren–Lawrence X-ray grade of 2 – 4. At week 8, compared with placebo, <b>tanezumab</b> 25, 100, and 200  μg/kg improved index knee pain during walking (− 18. 5, − 14. 3, and − 27. 6, respectively), index knee pain in the past 24  h (− 19. 1, − 14. 6, and − 24. 2, respectively), current index knee pain (− 16. 5, − 10. 9, and − 22. 8, respectively), and the WOMAC pain (− 11. 5, − 9. 6, and − 18. 8, respectively), physical function (− 8. 7, − 9. 5, and − 17. 6, respectively), and stiffness (− 20. 4, − 11. 2, and − 10. 2, respectively) subscales. Overall, seven patients reported AEs of abnormal peripheral sensation: allodynia (two in the <b>tanezumab</b> 200  μg/kg group); paresthesia (two in the <b>tanezumab</b> 200  μg/kg group), dysesthesia (one in the <b>tanezumab</b> 200  μg/kg group); thermohypoesthesia (one in the <b>tanezumab</b> 100  μg/kg group), and decreased vibratory sense (one in the placebo group). All of these AEs were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. ConclusionsTanezumab was safe and generally well tolerated and may improve pain symptoms in Japanese patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee.

40|$|<b>Tanezumab</b> {{is a new}} {{therapeutic}} {{intervention for}} patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. We performed the present meta-analysis to appraise the efficacy and safety of <b>tanezumab</b> for patients with knee OA. We systematically searched randomized controlled trials from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The primary outcomes were mean change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, the WOMAC physical function and patient's global assessment (PGA). Outcomes were reported as the standard mean difference (SMD) or relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). We assessed the pooled data using a random-effects model. Of the identified studies, four were eligible and were included in this meta-analysis (N = 1839 participants). Compared with the placebo groups, <b>tanezumab</b> yielded {{a significant reduction in}} mean change in the WOMAC pain (SMD = 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 69, P< 0. 00001), the WOMAC physical function (SMD = 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 74, P< 0. 00001) and PGA (SMD = 0. 34, 95 % CI 0. 22 to 0. 47, P< 0. 00001). There {{was no significant difference in}} serious adverse events (RR = 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 59 to 1. 92, P = 0. 84) between the <b>tanezumab</b> and placebo groups. <b>Tanezumab</b> significantly increased discontinuations due to adverse events (RR = 2. 89, 95 % CI 1. 59 to 5. 26, P = 0. 0005), abnormal peripheral sensations (RR = 3. 14, 95 % CI 2. 12 to 4. 66, P< 0. 00001), and peripheral neuropathy (RR = 6. 05, 95 % CI 2. 32 to 15. 81, P = 0. 0002). <b>Tanezumab</b> can alleviate pain and improve function for patients with OA of the knee.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} four complementary biosensors (Biacore 3000, Octet QK, ProteOn XPR 36, and KinExA 3000) in characterizing the kinetics of human nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to a humanized NGF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (<b>tanezumab,</b> formerly known as RN 624). <b>Tanezumab</b> is a clinical candidate as a therapy for chronic pain. Our measurements {{were consistent with the}} NGF/tanezumab binding affinity being tighter than 10 pM due to the formation of an extremely stable complex that had an estimated half-life exceeding 100 h, which was beyond the resolution of any of our methods. The system was particularly challenging to study because NGF is an obligate homodimer, and we describe various assay orientations and immobilization methods that were used to minimize avidity in our experiments while keeping NGF in as native a state as possible. We also explored the interactions of NGF with its natural receptors, TrkA and P 75, and how <b>tanezumab</b> blocks them. The Biacore blocking assay that we designed was used to quantify the potency of <b>tanezumab</b> and is more precise and reproducible than the currently available cell-based functional assays...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} anti-NGF antibody treatment in hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), a systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken utilizing the criteria described by the Cochrane collaboration. Both published and unpublished trials were identified for <b>tanezumab,</b> fulranumab and fasinumab in hip and knee OA; sponsors were contacted to provide and confirm data. Study quality was assessed by Jadad criteria; efficacy and safety data were extracted independently by two individuals and meta-analyses were performed using Revman 5. 2. 13 randomized, controlled trials were identified: 10 of <b>tanezumab,</b> two of fulranumab and one with fasinumab. All agents demonstrated superiority in efficacy compared to placebo. The highest doses in the phase II studies of <b>tanezumab</b> had a standardized effect size for WOMAC pain of 0. 73 (CI, 0. 51, 0. 95). Subsequent phase III studies of <b>tanezumab</b> and phase II studies of fulranumab and fasinumab reported standardized effect sizes for WOMAC pain of − 0. 15 – 0. 5, with no clear distinction among dose levels. <b>Tanezumab</b> compared to NSAIDs and opioids showed greater efficacy with a standardized effect size for WOMAC pain of 0. 23 (CI 0. 17 – 0. 29). WOMAC function and PGA results were similar to WOMAC pain. Safety, determined by odds ratios of withdrawals from studies due to adverse events (AEs), was better at the lower doses than higher doses and similar among all agents. These results demonstrate that antibodies to NGF provide efficacy in OA and that general safety at the lower doses appears similar to placebo. Additional data on both efficacy and safety of these antibodies are needed to define the optimal dose to maximize benefit to risk...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tanezumab,</b> an {{antibody}} to nerve growth factor, {{was administered}} to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys at 0, 0. 5, 4, and 30 mg/kg weekly, beginning gestation day (GD) 20 through parturition (GD 165). Maternal <b>tanezumab</b> administration appeared to increase stillbirths and infant mortality, but no consistent pattern of gross and/or microscopic change was detected to explain the mortality. Offspring exposed in utero were evaluated at 12 months of age using light microscopy (all tissues), stereology (basal forebrain cholinergic and dorsal root ganglia neurons), and morphometry (sural nerve). Light microscopy revealed decreased number of neurons in sympathetic ganglia (superior mesenteric, cervicothoracic, and ganglia in the thoracic sympathetic trunk). Stereologic assessment indicated an overall decrease in dorsal root ganglion (thoracic) volume and number of neurons in animals exposed to <b>tanezumab</b> 4 mg/kg (n 9) and 30 mg/kg (n 1). At all <b>tanezumab</b> doses, the sural nerve was small due to decreases in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Existing axons/ myelin sheaths appeared normal when viewed with light and transmission electron microscopy. There was no indication of tanezumab-related, active neuron/nerve fiber degeneration/necrosis in any tissue, indicating decreased sensory/ sympathetic neurons and axonal changes were due to hypoplasia or atrophy. These changes in the sensory and sympathetic portions of the peripheral nervous system suggest some degree of developmental neurotoxicity, although what effect, if any, the changes had on normal function and survival was not apparent.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of repeated doses of the humanized anti-nerve growth factor antibody, <b>tanezumab,</b> during open-label treatment of patients with OA knee pain. DesignThe current study (clinicaltrials. gov identifier: NCT 00399490) was a multicenter, phase II, open-label, multiple-dose extension of an earlier randomized clinical trial. All patients (N= 281) received infusions of <b>tanezumab</b> 50 μg/kg on Days 1 and 56 with subsequent doses administered at 8 -week intervals (up to a total of eight infusions). The primary endpoint of this study was safety. Effectiveness evaluations included overall knee pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index subscales, and subject global assessment (SGA) of response to therapy on 0 – 100 point visual analog scales. ResultsRepeated administration of <b>tanezumab</b> resulted in a low incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs; 7. 5 %). The rate of serious AEs was also low (2. 8 %) with none considered treatment-related. Few AEs of abnormal peripheral sensation were reported; hypoesthesia was reported by nine patients (3. 2 %), paresthesia by seven patients (2. 5 %), and hyperesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, and sensory disturbance were each reported by one patient (0. 4 % for each). Most AEs of abnormal peripheral sensation were rated as mild (95 %) and the majority (65 %) resolved before study completion. At Week 8, overall knee pain and SGA improved from baseline by a mean (±standard error) of − 12. 8 (± 1. 78) and 8. 0 (± 1. 66), respectively. Similar improvements occurred for WOMAC subscales. ConclusionsRepeated injections of <b>tanezumab</b> in patients with moderate to severe knee OA provide continued pain relief and improved function with a low incidence of side effects. Additional studies to define the efficacy and duration of pain reduction and to provide a more complete assessment of long-term safety are warranted...|$|E

However, the question that remains is whether we, as physicians, have adequate therapeutic options to offer to the {{patients who suffer from}} chronic low back pain but fail both conservative therapy and interventional pain procedures before they consider surgical options such as discectomy, disc arthroplasty, or spinal fusion. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the potential novel therapies that are on the horizon for the treatment of chronic low back pain. We discuss medications that are currently in use through different phases of clinical trials (I–III) for the treatment of low back pain. In this review, we discuss revisiting the concept of chemonucleolysis using chymopapain, as the first drug in an intradiscal injection to reduce herniated disc size, and newer intradiscal therapies, including collagenase, chondroitinase, matrix metalloproteinases, and ethanol gel. We also review an intravenous glial cell-derived neurotrophic growth factor called artemin, which may repair sensory nerves compressed by herniated discs. Another new drug in development for low back pain without radiculopathy is a subcutaneous monoclonal antibody acting as nerve growth factor called <b>tanezumab.</b> Finally, we discuss how platelet-rich plasma and stem cells are being studied for the treatment of low back pain. We believe that with these new therapeutic options, we can bridge the current gap between conservative/interventional procedures and surgeries in patients with chronic back pain.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundReports {{of serious}} joint adverse events (AEs) due to osteonecrosis were noted during {{randomized}} placebo-controlled clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies to nerve growth factor (NGF), including <b>tanezumab</b> and fulranumab. MethodsAll available medical records from subjects with {{reported cases of}} osteonecrosis, as well as records of subjects who underwent joint replacement during these studies, were reviewed by an independent adjudication committee that was established by each company; the committees were different for each company and included distinct individual experts. Cases were categorized as having definite osteonecrosis, normal or rapid progression of osteoarthritis (OA), another diagnosis or unable to determine the underlying diagnosis. ResultsThe vast majority of investigator reported cases of osteonecrosis were adjudicated as either normal or rapid progression of OA. Indeed, the syndrome of rapid progression of OA associated with chondrolysis and bone destruction {{appears to be a}} safety signal that is associated with not only increasing doses of anti-NGF antibodies but also concomitant therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. ConclusionsThese results have implications for future clinical trials of anti-NGF agents in OA and other painful conditions...|$|E

Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) dominate the clinical landscape despite limited effectiveness and considerable side-effect profiles. Although significant advancements have identified myriad potential pain targets over the past several decades, the majority of new pain pharmacotherapies have failed to come to market. The discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its interaction with tropomyosin receptor kinase A (trkA) have been well characterized as important mediators of pain initiation and maintenance, and pharmacotherapies targeting this pathway have the potential to be considered promising methods in the treatment of a variety of nociceptive and neuropathic pain conditions. Several methodologic approaches, including sequestration of free NGF, prevention of NGF binding and trkA activation, and inhibition of trkA function, have been investigated in the development of new pharmacotherapies. Among these, NGF-sequestering antibodies have exhibited the most promise in clinical trials. However, in 2010, reports of rapid joint destruction leading to joint replacement prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to place a hold on all clinical trials involving anti-NGF antibodies. Although the FDA has since lifted this hold and a number of new trials are under way, the long-term efficacy and safety profile of anti-NGF antibodies are yet to be established.
