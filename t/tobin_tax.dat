25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the <b>Tobin</b> <b>tax,</b> Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E

Other notable supporters include the Archbishop of Canterbury, Bill Gates and Michael Moore. David Harding, founder and CEO of one of London's biggest hedge funds has given qualified support for a European tax on financial transactions, breaking ranks with many of his peers fiercely opposed to such a measure. Speculator George Soros, put forward a different proposal, calling rich countries to donate their special drawing rights {{for the purpose of}} providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the <b>Tobin</b> <b>tax</b> idea. It has been widely reported that the Pope backs such a tax. However, the reality is that a commission of the Vatican of which the Pope is not a member merely said that such a tax would be worth reflecting on.|$|E

Such an approach sees world conscience best expressing itself through political reforms promoting democratically based globalisation or planetary democracy (for example internet voting for global governance organisations (see world government) based {{on the model of}} [...] "one person, one vote, one value") which gradually will replace contemporary market-based globalisation.|$|E

[...] However, on 16 June 1995 Spahn suggested that [...] "Most of the difficulties of the <b>Tobin</b> <b>tax</b> could be resolved, possibly with a two-tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax and an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates."

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} choice of {{monetary}} policy regime in a small open economy under productivity shocks and noise traders in forex markets. We focus on two simple rules: fixed exchange rates and inflation targeting. We contrast the above two rules against optimal policy with commitment.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the East Asian crisis a number of authors have argued that capital mobility is highly destabilizing, and that emerging countries would benefit from restricting capital flows. In this paper I investigate, from a historical perspective, the effectiveness of capital controls. I deal with <b>Tobin</b> <b>taxes,</b> controls on outflows and controls on inflows. I argue that controls on outflows have seldom worked as expected. They introduce major distortions and breed corruption. Market-based controls on inflows - similar to those implemented by Chile - have the potential for lengthening the maturity of foreign debt. They are not very effective, however, in achieving other objectives, including a higher degree of monetary policy independence. ...|$|R
40|$|Stochastic general {{equilibrium}} {{models of}} small open economies with occasionally binding financial frictions {{are capable of}} mimicking both the business cycles and the crisis events associated with the sudden stop in access to credit markets (Mendoza, 2010). In this paper we study the inefficiencies associated with borrowing decisions in a two-sector small open production economy. We find that this economy {{is much more likely}} to display "under-borrowing" rather than "over-borrowing" in normal times. As a result, macro-prudential policies (i. e. <b>Tobin</b> <b>taxes</b> or economy-wide controls on capital inflows) are costly in welfare terms in our economy. Moreover, we show that macro-prudential policies aimed at minimizing the probability of the crisis event might be welfare-reducing in production economies. Our analysis shows that there is a much larger scope for welfare gains from policy interventions during financial crises. That is to say that, within our modeling approach, ex post or crisis-management policies dominate ex ante or macro-prudential ones.

2500|$|To {{avoid this}} problem, most {{proposals}} emphasized taxing clearly speculative high-volume very-short-term (seconds to hours) transactions {{that could not}} in general reflect any change of fundamental exposure or cashflow expectation. [...] Some of these emphasized the automated nature of the trade. [...] FTT proposals often emerge in response to specific crisis. [...] For example, the December 1994 Mexican peso crisis reduced confidence in its currency. In that context, Paul Bernd Spahn re-examined the <b>Tobin</b> <b>tax,</b> opposed its original form, and instead proposed his own version in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|As {{another example}} of an FTT {{proposal}} {{as a warning to}} speculators, or as response to crisis, in March 2016 China drafted rules to impose a genuine currency transaction tax and this was referred to in financial press as a <b>Tobin</b> <b>tax</b> [...] [...] This was widely viewed as a warning to curb shorting of its currency the yuan. [...] It was however expected to keep this tax at 0% initially, calculating potential revenue from different rate schemes and exemptions, and not to impose the actual tax unless speculation increased.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest among economists, political leaders and non-governmental organizations in instituting a set of currency transactions <b>taxes</b> (CTT) or <b>Tobin</b> <b>taxes.</b> The motivation has been two-fold: {{to raise money for}} important social purposes, such as reducing poverty in developing, combating global warming, or providing basic health care in developing nations; and reducing instability in currency markets by reducing the volume of trading. It is plausible that a well-designed CTT could serve both ends. Simple arithmetic shows that a CTT set at even a very modest rate (e. g. 0. 1 percent), could raise an enormous amount of revenue. With daily trading volume now exceeding $ 1 trillion, a 0. 1 percent tax could raise over $ 100 billion annually, even with very large decline in trading volume. Similarly, by reducing the volume of trading, it is possible that a CTT will increase the stability of currency markets. This could be the case if the traders who are discouraged by the tax are destabilizing speculators, or noise traders, rather than arbitrage traders. Also, reduced trading volume should facilitate effective intervention by central banks seeking to maintain stability in currency markets. However, a CTT that applies to the spot market for currency cannot possibly achieve these objectives. This paper shows that: that such a tax will be readily evaded by speculators acting in secondary markets, and that trading in secondary markets can easily move the spot market. It argues that to be effective, any CTT will have to be applied {{to a wide range of}} financial instruments. Furthermore, a broadly based financial transactions tax is socially desirable, for all the reasons that a CTT is desirable in currency markets...|$|R

In Inside Story, John Langmore looks at {{an idea whose}} time has come NEARLY forty years ago the eminent macroeconomist James <b>Tobin</b> proposed a <b>tax</b> on foreign exchange transactions as a means of “throwing some sand in the well-greased wheels” of financial speculation. The idea attracted little attention at the time, and it wasn’t until twenty years later that I first learnt the detail of Tobin’s proposal. In the meantime he had been awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize for economics. By the early 1990 s I was deeply concerned by the power of international financial markets to dominate national economic policy. When the Parliamentary Research Service listed an article Tobin had published in the Financial Times in December 1992, I wrote to him and he sent me his original proposal. I was persuaded by his argument and started advocating that the idea be studied more closely. At the next Labor Party national conference the party platform was amended to include support for a study of the Tobin proposal, and with ministerial support I was able to speak about the idea at preparatory meetings for the United Nations Social Summit in New York in 1993 and 1994 [...] .

40|$|This thesis {{employs the}} {{disciplines}} of Law and Economics to analyse the effects {{and implications of}} speculative capital flows (SCF). Using descriptive analysis {{as part of its}} methodology, it covers matters relating to: globalisation, macroeconomics, the international monetary and financial system (IMS), the international monetary market (IMM), foreign exchange trading, financial stability, international monetary law, prudential regulation, case law and legal and economic philosophy. The global financial crisis of 2008 (GFC) demonstrated that there are several areas of weakness within the international monetary and financial system. Notwithstanding the variety of problems, this dissertation focuses primarily on the practise of moving speculative capital around the world to gain a profit and examines what effect that has on national economies and what should be done to reduce the impact of those practices. The thesis uses the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the Balance of Payments Equation and the Mundell Fleming IS-LM-BP Model to highlight the effects of speculative capital flows on national economies. The legal argument advanced in the thesis is that: for several decades speculative capital flows have become increasingly destabilising to the global economy, and that State Responsibility and the doctrine of due diligence imposed by the mandates of international monetary law can, and should, be employed to help rectify this problem. The thesis evaluates several options to minimise exchange rate volatility and shows how financial instability attributed to current practises might be curtailed through enhanced regulation. The thesis argues that enforcing the provisions already contained within international monetary law would help reform the framework through which the international monetary market operates; it is both economically warranted and legally justifiable. Not only might reform help stabilise the international monetary system, it could also create a more equitable and robust environment in which the global economy could flourish. The dissertation revisits the Social Contract theories prescribed by John Locke, Charles-Louis de Secondat and Adam Smith. The work of Vilfredo Pareto and his theory of Optimality, Nicholas Kaldor's and John Hicks's modified version of Cost Benefit Efficiency and Richard Posner's Economic Analysis of Law are applied to speculative capital flows. The philosophical and rational expectation arguments support the need for more control over financial markets and that legislators must be pro-active in pursuing that goal. The discourse examines what alternatives are available for reducing the destabilising effects of speculative capital flows. The thesis analyses capital controls, the adoption of <b>Tobin</b> type <b>taxes,</b> more currency unions, and a single world currency. It describes how the regulatory requirements for international finance are lagging behind market advancements and identifies deficiencies within global prudential regulation. Henceforth, the laws (both international and domestic) must catch up to current market practises. The thesis applies three theories for regulatory reform, these being: Ian Ayres' and John Braithwaite's Regulatory Pyramid, Stuart Umpleby's application of Requisite Variety, and Anne-Marie Slaughter's concept of a New World Order. The combination of those propositions guides the research towards the necessary components for an effective regulatory framework suitable for addressing the issue of speculative capital flows and financial stability within the global economy. The thesis makes recommendations but concludes that while international dialogue has increased since the global financial crisis and prudential supervision of global markets has become an agenda item for discussion in G 20 countries, any proposals or strategies for improving financial stability, reducing foreign exchange volatility and transaction costs within the global economy remain typically at the discretion of G 7 leaders...|$|R
2500|$|In 1972 the {{economist}} James Tobin proposed {{a tax on}} all spot conversions of one currency into another. The so-called <b>Tobin</b> <b>tax</b> is intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency.

In 2001, James Tobin {{looked back at the}} 1994 Mexican peso crisis, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and said: [...] " [...] tax [...] on foreign exchange transactions... dissuades speculators as many investors invest their money in foreign exchange on a very short-term basis.

Castro cited holocaust reparations as a previously established precedent for the concept of reparations. Castro also suggested that the United Nations be the administrator of this tax, stating the following:May the tax suggested by Nobel Prize Laureate James Tobin be imposed in a reasonable and effective way on the current speculative operations accounting for trillions of US dollars every 24 hours, then the United Nations, which cannot go on depending on meager, inadequate, and belated donations and charities, will have one trillion US dollars annually to save and develop the world.
