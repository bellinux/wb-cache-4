5|$|Bouck {{tried to}} contact Regimental {{headquarters}} on the SCR-300 radio for instructions. A sniper shot the radio as Bouck held it to his ear. <b>The</b> <b>sniper</b> also hit the SCR-284 radio mounted in the Jeep behind Bouck, eliminating any possibility of calling for reinforcements or instructions.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Major-General Charles Blackader {{left the}} {{division}} on medical grounds {{and was replaced}} by Major-General Thomas Cubitt. The division received replacements for casualties, disbanded <b>the</b> <b>sniper</b> company and engaged in rifle training. Once back on the line, the division return to its previous routine of static warfare: conducting patrols and raids, as well as being subjected to raids and artillery bombardments.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> did {{not have}} the proper {{equipment}} for this hostage rescue operation. The Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifles used were considered by several experts to be inadequate for the distance at which <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> were trying to shoot. The G3, the standard service rifle of the Bundeswehr at that time, had a 18 in barrel; at <b>the</b> distances <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> were required to shoot, a 27 in barrel would have ensured far greater accuracy. None of the rifles were equipped with telescopic or infrared sights. Additionally, none of <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> were equipped with a steel helmet or bullet-proof vest. No armored vehicles were at the scene at Fürstenfeldbruck, and were only called in after the gunfight was well underway.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, <b>the</b> five German <b>snipers</b> at Fürstenfeldbruck did {{not have}} radio contact with one another (nor with the German authorities conducting the rescue operation) and therefore were unable to coordinate their fire. The only contact <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> had with <b>the</b> operational leadership was with Georg Wolf, who was lying next to <b>the</b> three <b>snipers</b> on <b>the</b> control tower giving orders directly to them. <b>The</b> two <b>snipers</b> at ground level had been given vague instructions to shoot when <b>the</b> other <b>snipers</b> began shooting, and were basically left to fend for themselves.|$|R
50|$|According to a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{statement}} on 10 July, British Army snipers took up sniping positions in Corry's timber yard and reinforced them with sandbags. Two cars pulled into Springhill and <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> fired two shots at them. One {{of the cars}} fled while the other drove a short distance and stopped, the occupants got out and <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> opened fire again, One occupant {{was shot in the}} back of the head and was seriously wounded. A resident rushed to help the injured man but was immediately shot in the arm, and this man's brother and a friend ran to the downed occupant but both were shot by <b>the</b> <b>snipers.</b> At some point during this time a 13-year-old girl was fatally shot by <b>the</b> <b>snipers.</b> <b>The</b> parish priest and a passer-by (the priest was waving a white cloth) rushed to her but a sniper killed both with a single bullet that passed through both their heads. All the victims were unarmed.|$|R
5|$|James Bond is {{assigned}} to aid the defection of a KGB officer, General Georgi Koskov, covering his escape from a concert hall in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia during intermission. During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill <b>the</b> <b>sniper,</b> he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov {{across the border into}} Austria and then on to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Players use melee attacks, {{firearms}} and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons {{such as the}} Micro Uzi, an M16 rifle and a flamethrower. The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with <b>the</b> <b>sniper</b> rifle, rocket launcher and the M16 rifle. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle. The game gives players {{a wide variety of}} weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
5|$|This story {{occurs as}} the war reaches its height. The South American Unification Army {{receives}} reports of a rogue sniper operating deep in the jungles of Patagonia, and sends a platoon {{under the command of}} Master Sergeant Murdock to neutralize the threat. However, the entire platoon is killed off one by one by <b>the</b> <b>sniper,</b> until only Murdock is left. All alone, Murdock catches a glimpse of this mysterious sniper through his binoculars—and is shocked to find that he gazes upon the figure of a beautiful nun.|$|E

50|$|American and British {{special forces}} reacted by {{deploying}} their own sniper teams. Local Afghanistan civilians located {{a group of}} about six foreign-trained mercenary <b>snipers</b> working in <b>the</b> region, including <b>the</b> Sangin <b>Sniper.</b> Special Forces confirmed through close surveillance the precise co-ordinates of <b>the</b> <b>snipers,</b> then called in United States Air Force F-16 jets, which dropped their Joint Direct Attack Munitions and killed <b>the</b> Sangin <b>Sniper.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chris L., Dafydd, Jim, and Mel {{were shot}} by <b>the</b> <b>snipers.</b> Chris G., Paul, Paula, Tanya, {{and much to}} the other player's surprises, Karrie, made it past <b>the</b> <b>snipers.</b> They were close to {{completely}} defusing the bomb, but Chris G. and Tanya (Chris G. and Tanya worked on one side, Karrie, Paul, and Paula worked on the other) performed a wrong procedure, causing the bomb to explode.|$|R
5|$|Sing's marksmanship at Gallipoli saw him dubbed 'The Assassin' or 'The Murderer' by his comrades. He {{reportedly}} {{acquired the}} latter nickname {{due to his}} callous attitude towards the enemy. By early September 1915, he had taken 119 kills, according to Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, commanding officer of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Regimental records list Sing as having taken 150 confirmed kills, but on 23 October 1915, General William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC forces, issued an order complimenting him on his 201 unconfirmed kills. Historian Bob Courtney noted that an official kill was recorded only if the spotter saw the target fall. If the first shot missed the target, it was very risky {{to take a second}} shot, as this could give away <b>the</b> <b>sniper</b> team's position.|$|E
5|$|The player may run, jump, {{or drive}} {{vehicles}} {{to navigate the}} game's world. The player uses melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the Colt Python, an M60 machine gun and a Minigun. The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with <b>the</b> <b>sniper</b> rifle and rocket launcher. In addition, the game's combat allows the player to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle. The game provides the player {{a wide variety of}} weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
5|$|When his men {{finally took}} the hill, 15 Germans {{had been killed}} and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star. He was awarded a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot <b>the</b> <b>sniper</b> between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and {{kept him out of}} combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> semifinals, <b>the</b> <b>Snipers</b> {{made their}} move and {{finished}} {{in a tie}} with M. Lhuillier at the top, 4-2. However, <b>the</b> <b>Snipers</b> earned <b>the</b> home court advantage in the championship series. The Huskers finished at 3-3, bungling a chance to force a triple-tie thanks to a loss to Harbour Centre {{on the final day}} of the semis. That was Harbour Centre’s lone semifinal win.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>snipers</b> were John Allen Muhammad (aged 41) and Lee Boyd Malvo (aged 17), who {{travelled}} in a blue, 1990 Chevrolet Caprice sedan. Their crime spree, {{begun in}} February 2002, featured murders and robberies {{in the states}} of Alabama, Arizona, and Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, and Washington, which resulted in seven deaths and seven injured people; in ten months, <b>the</b> <b>snipers</b> killed 17 people and injured 10 other people.|$|R
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at <b>the</b> <b>sniper,</b> revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|By seven-thirty, {{the town}} was firmly {{in the hands of}} Major-General Hunter's force. Almost the {{entirety}} of the Mahdist garrison, excepting the cavalry, had been slain in desperate combats throughout the settlement. However, a few isolated pockets of Mahdist resistance remained in fortified houses, violently refusing to give up the fight. Six men sent to capture a Mahdist sniper's position in a small house near the river were each killed, forcing Hunter to invoke his artillery. The building was shelled to ruins, but <b>the</b> <b>sniper</b> survived, evidenced by the shooting of another soldier sent to locate his body. Finally, a second barrage of artillery blasted what remained of the structure and the rubble fell silent, though the sniper's body was never found. The local inhabitants had armed themselves with clubs and spears to defend themselves during the battle, but played little role in its outcome.|$|E
5|$|Section 9 {{operatives}} {{develop a}} theory that a hacker known as the Puppeteer or 傀儡廻 (Kugutsumawashi, literally 'Puppet Spinner', contrasted with the original film Puppet Master who was 人形使い Ningyō-zukai, literally 'Doll Handler') is responsible for Siak agents' forced suicides and Togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus. All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when {{they are part of}} a larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one in the same. <b>The</b> <b>sniper</b> says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> MR1 <b>sniper</b> is a {{long range}} {{counterpart}} of the MR1. <b>The</b> MR1 <b>sniper</b> is rated higher than the original marker for its superior accuracy to countless other markers. <b>The</b> MR1 <b>sniper</b> featuresa 16" [...] barrel rather than a 12" [...] on a standard model.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> D.C. <b>sniper</b> attacks (also <b>the</b> Beltway <b>sniper</b> attacks) were {{a series}} of coordinated shootings {{occurred}} during three weeks in October 2002, in the states of Maryland and Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Ten {{people were killed and}} three others were critically injured, in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and along Interstate 95 in Virginia. <b>The</b> <b>snipers</b> were John Allen Muhammad (aged 41) and Lee Boyd Malvo (aged 17), who travelled in a blue, 1990 Chevrolet Caprice sedan.

50|$|A {{friendly}} <b>sniper</b> {{is generally}} <b>the</b> most effective counter-sniper tool. With similar training, {{knowledge of the}} surroundings, and equipment, <b>the</b> friendly <b>sniper</b> can offer advice to the squad, enhanced searching capability, and combat <b>the</b> enemy <b>sniper</b> directly. When told what to watch for, the squad can also act as additional eyes and ears for <b>the</b> friendly <b>sniper.</b> Aside from watching over the squad, <b>the</b> friendly <b>sniper</b> also has <b>the</b> option to detach and engage <b>the</b> enemy <b>sniper.</b> Without any outside help from the squad, the respective skills of each sniper {{play a significant role}} in determining victory.|$|R

5|$|When Sorceress Edea {{becomes the}} Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is {{introduced}} as <b>the</b> <b>sniper</b> for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall {{that he always}} chokes under pressure. In spite of his nerves and under intense pressure, he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he {{and most of the}} other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.|$|E
