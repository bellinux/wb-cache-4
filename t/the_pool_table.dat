Alone in the billiard room, Sumner tells Diane that, against her will, he submitted one of her unfinished manuscripts {{to one of his}} colleagues, who praised it, and was sent to publishers. At first, she becomes excited. However, Sumner persuades her to leave everyone and everything behind, including Sam, in order to hone her talents. He warns her that finishing the novel is impossible and that her potentials will be wasted if she marries Sam. Diane tells Sumner to leave the bar and never return again. Unbeknownst to them, Sam overhears this conversation under <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>table</b> whose underneath is covered by drapes.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>table</b> where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video.

The south wall has three built-in television sets, a stereo, and cabinets for Elvis' record collection. [...] Opposite of the TV room is the billiard room; Elvis, an avid billiards player, bought <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>table</b> in 1960 and had {{the walls and ceiling}} covered with 350–400 yards of pleated cotton fabric after the two basement rooms were remodeled in 1974.

25|$|By {{elevating}} head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), {{a notable}} difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams {{with the same}} number of match points (table points). These rules allowed <b>the</b> winners of <b>Pools</b> A, B and C to be determined by the results of <b>the</b> third <b>pool</b> matches on <b>the</b> weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences at the end of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare.

5000|$|Queried on {{the subject}} of his pitching, Lassiter himself said, [...] "Oh, sure, I played some baseball.

Wellington Wimpy character of the Popeye comic strip by the same name who loved to eat hamburgers). So instead of baseball, Lassiter focused on pool, developing his game at City Billiards in Elizabeth City. The owner of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> room there, a man named Speedy Ives, allowed Lassiter to enter through the back door and to shoot whenever he wanted as long as Lassiter cleaned the floors and swept <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R

Bare-legged, sandal-footed Mexicans in white rubbed {{shoulders}} with Mexicans mantled in black and red.

2500|$|Late in 1976, another fellow student, Andrew Smith (Greedy Smith) made guest {{appearances}} {{with the}} band on harmonica whilst still a member of another band, and by year's end Smith had joined full-time and he also played keyboards.

They played numerous Elvis covers and two original songs, together with their usual set of Blues, Rockabilly, Country and 1960s covers including Roy Orbison and The Monkees. The band built up a live following in Sydney with their residencies at the Unicorn Hotel in inner-city Paddington on Mondays and the Civic Hotel in the CBD on Thursdays.

2500|$|However, {{there is}} a second problem about the interaction. Namely, the {{question}} of how the interaction takes place, where in dualism [...] "the mind" [...] is assumed to be non-physical and by definition outside of the realm of science. The mechanism which explains the connection between the mental and the physical would therefore be a philosophical proposition as compared to a scientific theory. For example, compare such a mechanism to a physical mechanism that is well understood. Take a very simple causal relation, such as when a cue ball strikes an eight ball and causes it to go into the pocket. What happens in this case is that the cue ball has a certain amount of momentum as its mass moves across <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>table</b> with a certain velocity, and then that momentum is transferred to the eight ball, which then heads toward the pocket. Compare this to the situation in the brain, where one wants to say that a decision causes some neurons to fire and thus causes a body to move across the room. The intention to [...] "cross the room now" [...] is a mental event and, as such, it does not have physical properties such as force. If it has no force, then it would seem that it could not possibly cause any neuron to fire. However, with Dualism, an explanation is required of how something without any physical properties has physical effects.|$|E

For this competition, HouseGuests were separated into two teams, and were required to get into two pools of chocolate {{one at a time}} and spell out words with the letters inside. The team with the most correctly spelled words would win the competition, but would only win the food items they had spelled. The team of Chelsia, Joshuah, Sharon, and Sheila were the losers, thus were put on the slop diet for the week. That same day, Ryan chose to nominate Sharon and Chelsia for eviction. Following this, Chelsia, James, Joshuah, Sharon, and Sheila devised a plan to get Ryan to backdoor Matt that week, and they told Natalie in hopes of getting her to agree with the plan. Despite initially agreeing, she later informed Matt of this plan. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Adam, Sheila, and Joshuah were selected to compete; Matt was selected to host. On Day 30, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Color of Veto" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests used an over-sized pool stick to shoot their ball {{as close as possible to}} the center of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> <b>table.</b> The HouseGuest furthest away each round was eliminated, and would be able to select a prize. Ryan was the winner of the competition, however, chose to take a prize and allowed Chelsia to win the Power of Veto. Despite Ryan agreeing to the plan to backdoor Matt, Sheila later became offended by Chelsia and attempted to convince Ryan to keep Matt in the game. On Day 32, Chelsia chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with James being nominated in her place. On Day 35, James became the seventh HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of five to one. Following this, it was revealed that the viewers had voted for one HouseGuest to return to the game, and that the current HouseGuests would vote to either bring back America's selection or the recently evicted James; though not revealed to the HouseGuests, Alex was selected by the viewers to return.

50|$|Prior to European settlement, {{the area}} {{surrounding}} the future site of Alliance was, at times, home to First Nations tribes who roamed the plains.

By 1910, the area surrounding what is now Alliance was well populated by Europeans, and in January 1916, the Canadian Northern Railway arrived in the young community.
