Greg Hermann, a 343 Industries <b>technical</b> <b>lead</b> who had experience with Bungie technology, assisted Saber in development of a networking solution that would allow online co-op. Since the original game would behave identically when given the same scenario and inputs, only the player inputs needed to be synchronized between players' Xbox consoles.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{announced}} {{the launch of}} IMA Lab, a consulting service within the museum's technology department. IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations that want to use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the <b>technical</b> <b>lead,</b> is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and make them more accessible.|$|E

In Overview mode, the user can scroll a zoomed-out version of certain web pages. Using a built-in pointer, the user can zoom into {{a portion of the}} page to provide a clearer view; this is similar to the functionality of Opera's Nintendo-based web browsers.

As part of the development effort for cross-platform QuickTime, Charlton (as architect and <b>technical</b> <b>lead),</b> along with ace individual contributor Michael Kellner and a small highly effective team including Keith Gurganus, ported a subset of the Macintosh Toolbox to Intel and other platforms (notably, MIPS and SGI Unix variants) as the enabling infrastructure for the QuickTime Media Layer (QTML) which was first demonstrated at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in May 1996. The QTML later became the foundation for the Carbon API which allowed legacy Macintosh applications to run on the Darwin kernel in Mac OS X.|$|E

500|$|New Musical Express {{journalist}} Nick Kent jammed occasionally {{with the}} band, but left upon Lydon's recruitment. [...] "When I came along, I {{took one look}} at him and said, 'No.That has to go,'" [...] Lydon later explained. [...] "He's never written a good word about me ever since." [...] In September, McLaren again helped hire private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, with a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook [...] "created a smokescreen" [...] by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a [...] "Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders" [...] (referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene). Most of the guitar players who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created a new sense of solidarity among the four band members. Steve New was considered the only talented guitarist who tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, and the band's developing sound had no room for the <b>technical</b> <b>lead</b> work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.|$|E

[...] The Lisa was a major project at the company, which reportedly spent more than $50 million on its development. More than 90 people participated on the design, plus more on the sales and marketing effort to launch the machine. BYTE credited Wayne Rosing with being {{the most important person}} {{on the development of the}} computer's hardware until the machine went into production, at which point he became <b>technical</b> <b>lead</b> for the entire Lisa project. Bruce Daniels was in charge of applications development, and Larry Tesler was in charge of system software.

Technical debate {{took place on the}} Interest Group mailing list and issues were resolved by consensus or, when that failed, majority vote of the Working Group. A record of design decisions and their rationales {{was compiled}} by Michael Sperberg-McQueen on December 4, 1997. James Clark served as <b>Technical</b> <b>Lead</b> of the Working Group, notably contributing the empty-element [...] "<empty/>" [...] syntax and the name [...] "XML".

The co-editors of the specification were originally Tim Bray and Michael Sperberg-McQueen. Halfway through the project Bray accepted a consulting engagement with Netscape, provoking vociferous protests from Microsoft. Bray was temporarily asked to resign the editorship. This led to intense dispute in the Working Group, eventually solved by the appointment of Microsoft's Jean Paoli as a third co-editor.|$|E

They use the HTML5 History API to maintain good-looking URLs in modern browsers despite the AJAX app. To achieve fast response times Google often renders the Closure templates on the server side before any JavaScript is loaded; then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes, hooks up event handlers, etc. The back ends are built mostly on top of BigTable and Colossus/GFS, and other common Google technologies such as MapReduce.|$|R
