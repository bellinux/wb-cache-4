40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we show how genetic {{programming}} {{can be used}} to discover useful texture feature extraction algorithms. Grey level histograms of different textures are used as inputs to <b>the</b> <b>evolved</b> programs. One dimensional K-means clustering is applied to the outputs and the tightness of the clusters is used as the fitness measure. To test generality, textures from the Brodatz library were used in learning phase and <b>the</b> <b>evolved</b> features were used on classification problems based on the Vistex library. Using <b>the</b> <b>evolved</b> features gave a test accuracy of 74. 8 % while using Haralick features, the most commonly used method in texture classification, gave an accuracy of 75. 5 % on the same problem. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>evolved</b> features are competitive with those derived by human intuition and analysis. Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>evolved</b> features are combined with the Haralick features the accuracy increases to 83. 2 %, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>evolved</b> features are finding texture regularities not used in the Haralick approach. ...|$|R

This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with <b>the</b> <b>evolving</b> tone and irreverence of the magazine.

5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space to improvise against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from the rhythm section—drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying electronic organ. <b>The</b> <b>evolving</b> {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread misunderstanding {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of the musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier.

Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia.

Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E

5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} event {{featured the}} buildup of a rivalry among two stables, groups {{of at least three}} wrestlers. The two groups were the Corporate Ministry and the Union. The Corporate Ministry was formed when the Corporation merged with the Ministry of Darkness; the Corporate Ministry consisted of Viscera, the Big Boss Man, and the Acolytes (Bradshaw and Faarooq). Throughout the month of May, the Ministry was involved in matches with Mankind, Ken Shamrock, the Big Show, and Test, and in retaliation, the four wrestlers formed the Union stable. The WWF continued to enhance the feud over several weeks, which included a brawl among all eight wrestlers on May 10, 1999. <b>The</b> <b>evolving</b> plot led to the promotion of an eight-man elimination tag team match between both groups at Over the Edge. In this bout, the team that eliminated all of its opponents would win.|$|E

After Batista retained his World Heavyweight Championship, Edge was scripted into a rivalry with him over his title. Eventually, The Undertaker was also placed in feud, {{which led to the}} advertising of a Triple Threat match at Armageddon for the title. At Armageddon, Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship. Due to the events that occurred at Survivor Series, a match was announced between Finlay and The Great Khali for Armageddon. Finlay prevailed at Armageddon via pinning The Great Khali. After surviving their Elimination tag team match, Triple H and Jeff Hardy were promoted into a match for Armageddon, in which the winner would win the opportunity to challenge for the WWE Championship. At Armageddon, Hardy defeated Triple H. Because Beth Phoenix and Mickie James were the leaders of their teams at Survivor Series, a feud evolved from this, which culminated into a match at Armageddon over Phoenix's WWE Women's Championship.
