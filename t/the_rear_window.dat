25|$|For film {{projection}} systems, Digital Theater Systems, the company behind the DTS surround sound standard, {{has created a}} digital captioning device called the DTS-CSS (Cinema Subtitling System). It {{is a combination of}} a laser projector which places the captioning (words, sounds) anywhere on the screen and a thin playback device with a CD that holds many languages. If <b>the</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> Captioning System is used, the DTS-CSS player is also required for sending caption text to <b>the</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> sign located {{in the rear of the}} theater.|$|E
25|$|Notchback: A {{configuration}} {{where the}} third box of a three-box styling configuration is less pronounced — especially where the rear deck (third box) is short or where <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> is upright.|$|E
25|$|The {{nose section}} can be removed, {{and there is}} also a hatch below <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> on <b>the</b> left side. Crew ingress and egress is {{possible}} by either route.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} two-door coupe {{models were}} offered. The lower-end Fairlane Club Coupe had pillars around <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> while <b>the</b> higher trim level was a pillarless two-door hardtop, {{similar to the}} convertible.|$|R
50|$|The M-407 {{was offered}} as an estate (407-423N), {{delivery}} (407-430), medical team model (407B), and taxi (407T). The delivery simply had <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> estate not cut out and <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> doors welded shut; {{it was only}} available to official groups.|$|R
25|$|The Limited {{trim level}} adds 17-inch alloy wheels, heated front seats, leather seat-upholstery, and a power sun shade in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> The Ultimate Package {{includes}} an enhanced audio system with 10 Infinity speakers and a 6 CD changer, a power sunroof, powered tilt-telescopic steering wheel, and rain-sensing windshield wipers.|$|E
25|$|Supreme V had a {{completely}} different rear design showing the styling of the next range that was probably under development. Tall heavily featured light clusters that were tinted to look dark were fitted vertically between the boot lid. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was a one piece design. The seat backs were no longer visible from outside the coach.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1971 Pontiac {{introduced}} the compact, budget-priced Ventura II (based {{on the third}} generation Chevrolet Nova). This same year, Pontiac completely restyled its full-sized cars, moved the Bonneville, {{and replaced it with}} a higher luxury model named the Grand Ville, while Safari wagons got a new clamshell tailgate that lowered into the body while <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> raised into the roof.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> {{elevation}} {{includes four}} short double-storeyed wings which form shallow courtyards. The first floor {{windows in the}} wings have round arches while <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> main building are flat arched. The roof dormers have barrel vaults and the wings are gabled.|$|R

50|$|All 1979, 1980 {{and some}} 1981 models had eight welded-in metal slats {{covering}} the engine ventilation passages behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows.</b> Later models had black plastic 16-slat covers that slotted {{in at the}} top and screwed down at the bottom.|$|R
25|$|In the exterior, Honda updates {{the front}} with larger air intakes {{on the lower}} front fascia, {{installs}} new head- and taillights, and has new wheel designs. The new grille comes with a blue stripe that Honda says represents the car’s “high-tech hybrid identity.” A thinner rear spoiler and a more compactly mounted rear wiper motor help to improve visibility through <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Matador station wagons had an {{available}} rear-facing third-row {{bench seat}} increasing total seating {{from six to}} eight passengers. In addition, all wagons included a roof rack and a two-way tailgate that opened when <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was down either from the top {{to serve as an}} extended flat surface that was even with the load floor, or to swing open like a regular door hinged on the left side.|$|E
25|$|Sedan: A car seating four or {{more with}} a fixed roof that is full-height up to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> Known in British English as a saloon. Sedans can have 2 or 4-doors. This {{is the most common}} body style. In the U.S., this term has been used to denote a car with fixed window frames, as opposed to the hardtop style wherein the sash, if any, winds down with the glass.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{model year}} was the 1969 [...] "K" [...] model. The 1969 172K had a {{redesigned}} tailfin cap and reshaped <b>rear</b> <b>windows.</b> Optional long-range 52 gal wing fuel tanks were offered. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> were slightly enlarged by 16 in2 cm2. The 1969 model sold for US$12,500 for the 172 and US$13,995 for the Skyhawk, with 1,170 made.|$|R
50|$|Farrand Hall {{is a large}} two-story Greek Revival {{frame house}} with {{clapboard}} siding and a gable roof. Pilasters decorate the eaves and {{the corners of the}} house, and flank the front door. A single story addition is located at <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> have six over six lights, with slightly smaller <b>windows</b> in <b>the</b> <b>rear,</b> and eyebrow <b>windows</b> in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> addition.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> and {{seats of}} the Kangoo could be removed, {{producing}} the panel van Kangoo Express. The Kangoo became {{popular with the}} mobility-impaired and wheelchair users due to its height and accessibility and because it could be adapted to include mounting points for wheelchairs.|$|R
25|$|In 2015, in {{the wake}} of renewed debate about the {{symbolism}} of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the General Lee 's roof and panel behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> in the first five episodes), reruns of the original series were pulled from circulation. Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the General Lee. However many people still make and sell custom General Lee diecast replicas everywhere online.|$|E
25|$|The Aura {{was a new}} styling {{direction}} for Saturn, with styling that resembled its cousin, the European Opel Vectra. All Aura models came standard with folding side mirrors and side marker lights, lending to its European stylings. The design of the Aura Special appearance pieces included an integrated radio antenna in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> a chrome appearance package available on XR models, standard 17inch wheels with five-spoke wheel covers and P225/50R17 all-season tires on XE models, and standard 18inch machined aluminum 14-spoke wheels on the XR with high-performance Goodyear Eagle LS2 P225/50R18 T tires.|$|E
25|$|Styling for 1939 {{featured}} a new two-piece “waterfall” grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and hubcaps were larger. Window area increased substantially with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges {{were moved to}} {{in front of the}} driver and the gear shift was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the later were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1545) sales only rose to 6097, with Roadmaster’s share of Buick’s total sales falling to 2.9 percent.|$|E
5000|$|While {{preparing}} Earl to {{be dropped}} from the crane, Scottie encountered a problem in that <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> needed to be opened to loop a chain through the passenger compartment, but the mechanism was jammed.

50|$|Prompted by a {{suggestion}} from a Fort Collins high school student, Fischer has floated legislation {{which would require}} teen drivers holding a learner's permit to display a decal in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> of their vehicles; the suggestion was not supported by an interim legislative committee on transportation.|$|R
25|$|For 1958, Chevrolet {{models were}} {{redesigned}} longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors, {{and the first}} ever production Chevrolet big block V8, the , was now an option. The Bel Air gained a halo vehicle in 1958, the Impala, available only as a hardtop coupe and convertible in its introductory year. Impala styling followed the basic lines of the other Chevrolet models but received special styling cues including a different roof line, a vent above <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> unique side trim, and triple tail lights housed in slightly broader alcoves. For the budget conscious, the Biscayne, (formerly the 210) and the Delray (formerly the 150) completed this model year's family-oriented and utility offerings.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design {{was different from}} the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left hand drive version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertible}} roof is fully automatic — an unusual feature {{in such a}} small car — and can be opened partially {{to act as a}} sunroof whilst the car is driving at speed. The convertible model forsakes the rear hatchback of the Hardtop Mini, replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' that is reminiscent of the classic Mini — it incorporates similarly prominent external hinges, and with the roof in the closed position, the rear roof section and luggage shelf can be raised with two handles, semi-tailgate style, to access the luggage space easier. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are lowered automatically when the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth, with many layers of insulation; <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> is glass with an integral heater/defroster, but no washer or wiper.|$|E
50|$|The first {{deliveries}} {{began in}} late 1966 and early 1967: in March, the range was completed {{with the arrival}} of the 1301U, an unprecedented version van with <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> replaced by sheet metal and only two seats, while <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> part of <b>the</b> passenger compartment has been completely emptied to make it a load compartment.|$|R
5000|$|A private-use {{version of}} the Life Van (called [...] "Wagon", chassis code WA) was added, priced midway between the two- and four-door sedans. This could also be {{equipped}} with the three-speed automatic. The Van can be told from a wagon by its tattletale luggage rails visible through <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>the</b> pulpit is on a {{slightly}} raised platform. It is centered {{in a round}} arch cut in the wall {{in such a way}} as to obstruct the upper portion of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows.</b> Double doors on the west wall lead to the wing, used for Sunday school during the church's active years. The newer wing on the north houses a modern kitchen and bathroom.|$|R
25|$|Probably {{the best}} known closed {{captioning}} option for film theaters is <b>the</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>Window</b> Captioning System from the National Center for Accessible Media. Upon entering the theater, viewers requiring captions are given a panel of flat translucent glass or plastic on a gooseneck stalk, which can be mounted {{in front of the}} viewer's seat. In the back of the theater is an LED display that shows the captions in mirror image. The panel reflects captions for the viewer but is nearly invisible to surrounding patrons. The panel can be positioned so that the viewer watches the movie through the panel, and captions appear either on or near the movie image. A company called Cinematic Captioning Systems has a similar reflective system called Bounce Back. A major problem for distributors has been that these systems are each proprietary, and require separate distributions to the theater to enable them to work. Proprietary systems also incur license fees.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse design language, {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> wiper and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance. The drag coefficient {{on the latest}} RX 350 {{has been reduced to}} 0.33 C'd. Exterior dimensions are increased, with cargo room increased by five percent over the prior generation. For the interior, major standard features include SmartAccess, a keyless entry and start system, electrochromic heated side mirrors, UV reducing exterior glass, Bluetooth, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power 10-way driver and passenger seats, sliding and reclining rear seats and a power rear hatch. The instrument cluster's multi-function display uses an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display. New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a computer mouse, with haptic feedback. Optional accessory features include XM Satellite Radio, a 15-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson Surround Sound audio system, a dual-screen Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES), 19-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, power front seat cushion extender, perforated and semi-aniline leather seats, a smog sensor for the HVAC system, power folding side view mirrors, and navigation system. With XM subscription the navigation adds real-time NavTraffic and NavWeather updates.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, the [...] "Kartal Kargo" [...] was introduced. This was a {{two-seater}} {{panel van}} {{version of the}} wagon, akin to Fiat's own Marengo line. The Kartal Kargo can manage a 600 kg payload. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> were plated and most trim details were in black plastic, but the Kargo did receive standard power steering.|$|R
