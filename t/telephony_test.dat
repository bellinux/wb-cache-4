40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the design}} of CTC-based all-neural (or end-to-end) speech recognizers. We propose a novel symbol inventory, and a novel iterated-CTC method in which a second system is used to transform a noisy initial output into a cleaner version. We present a number of stabilization and initialization methods we have found useful in training these networks. We evaluate our system on the commonly used NIST 2000 conversational <b>telephony</b> <b>test</b> set, and significantly exceed the previously published performance of similar systems, both with and {{without the use of}} an external language model and decoding technology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the technical and}} system building advances made in IBM’s speech recognition technology {{over the course of}} the DARPA Effective Affordable Reusable Speechto-Text (EARS) program. At a technical level, these advances include the development of a new form of feature-based Minimum Phone Error training (fMPE), the use of large-scale discriminatively trained full-covariance gaussian models, the use of septaphone acoustic context in static decoding graphs, and improvements in basic decoding algorithms. At a system building level, the advances include a system architecture based on cross-adaptation and the incorporation of 2100 hours of training data in every system component. We present results on English conversational <b>telephony</b> <b>test</b> data from the 2003 and 2004 NIST evaluations. The combination of technical advances and an order of magnitude more training data in 2004 reduced the error rate on the 2003 test set by approximately 21 % relative- from 20. 4 % to 16. 1 %- over the most accurate system in the 2003 evaluation and produced the most accurate results on the 2004 test sets in every speed category.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the architecture of}} our Internet <b>telephony</b> <b>testbed</b> intended to replace the departmental PBX (telephone switch). It interworks with the traditional telephone networks via a PSTN/IP gateway. It {{also serves as a}} corporate or campus infrastructure for various existing and future services like, web, email, video and streaming media. Initially intended for a few users, it will eventually replace the plain old telephones from our offices, due to the cost benefit and new services it offers. We also discuss common interoperability problems between the PBX and the gateway...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel mechanism for achieving secure and reliable peer-to-peer communications on the Internet. WhanauSIP merges a Sybil-proof distributed hash table with mature SIP technology to enable instant messaging, audio chat, and video conferencing that is resilient to censoring, eavesdropping, and forgery. Performance and security evaluations {{performed on the}} PlanetLab network demonstrate {{that the majority of}} resource lookups return within 5 seconds. These results indicate that WhanauSIP delivers practical performance with respect to call session initialization latency for VoIP <b>telephony.</b> Furthermore, the <b>tests</b> demonstrated that lookup performance was minimally affected during a Sybil cluster ID attack, illustrating the network’s resilience to malicious adversaries. The thesis delivers three software package...|$|R
40|$|The Remote Laboratory Management System (RLMS), REMLABNET (version 2014), for the {{integrating}} {{and management}} of remote experiments for starting university level and secondary schools, is presented. Its building was initiated both from the extensive use and expertise in Internet School Experimental System (ISES), remote experiments built {{and the lack of}} a similar system for secondary schools in Europe. RLMS is built, using new components, designed for the purpose, as Measureserver, web space management, data warehouse, communication board of RLMS, etc. The communication server will provide beside connection and diagnostics services also services for the teacher's comfort as white board, IP <b>telephony,</b> simulation inclusion, <b>test</b> management and reservation management.

40|$|Testing is {{a crucial}} part when {{developing}} electronics. One way to lower the costs and increase the efficiency is to avoid human interaction. This {{can be done with}} automated testing. The purpose with this thesis is to look into the possibility of automating <b>telephony</b> and facsimile <b>tests</b> with "off the shelf components" such as modems and standard computers. The proposed solution was put together and the needed software was developed, using Java. When testing electronics it is of most importance that the hardware and software carrying out the tests are reliable. To be able to ensure this, the software has been thoroughly tested, and the different error sources discussed. The biggest cause to the problems found was that the modems weren’t reliable. A general work around is presented, implemented and tested...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we will compare several {{approaches}} for predicting {{the quality of}} entire speech-only or audio-visual telephone calls from subjective judgments or predictions {{of the quality of}} individual segments of these calls. The comparison will be done using several databases which have been collected in a test paradigm to simulate conversational structures. The subjective judgments for individual conversation segments obtained in these tests, as well as instrumental quality estimations for these segments, are used as the basis for predicting episode-final quality ratings. Although different modeling approaches reach a similar performance, an optimum model is proposed which leads to comparably high prediction accuracy for speech-only and audio-visual <b>telephony.</b> Both the <b>test</b> paradigms as well as the call-quality prediction models are subject to standardization activities of ITU-T Study Group 12, for which this analysis is considered an input. Index Terms — call quality, episodic quality, time-varying quality, temporal integration, recency effec...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mobile {{telephony}} {{is described}} as a "two-sided " market where customers are seen as senders and receivers of communications that are mutually beneficial both to callers and receivers. This has implications in terms of market definition and market power. The economics of mobile call termination is discussed in this context. Key words: mobile telephony, market definition and call termination Market definition in mobile <b>telephony</b> The standard <b>test</b> adopted by most anti-trust and regulatory authorities to identify markets is the so-called SSNIP test (sometimes also referred to as the "hypothetical monopolist test"). This is designed to explore the consequences of a (hypothetical) Small but Significant and Non-transitory Increase in Price on the profitability of the (hypothetical) firm that initiates it. At the heart of this test lies the question of what might make such a price rise unsustainable. Some consumers may switch to substitute products ("demand-side substitutability") and some firms operating "near " to the (narrowly defined) candidate market may alter their plans and supply simila...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{cable system}} {{operators}} {{have to deal}} with bidirectional traffic from sources such as pay-per-view television, high-speed Internet access, and two-way <b>telephony.</b> A cable <b>testing</b> system is described that can handle bidirectional traffic even with RF noise (ingress) on the return path. The deregulation of the telecommunications industry has resulted in an unprecedented surge of effort to implement new telecommunications services. The cable television industry, in particular, is pushing hard to provide customers with two-way telephony, fast Internet service, and interactive video programming. As they prepare to implement and maintain two-way communications over their cable networks, cable industry engineers and providers of cable TV test equipment are facing {{a whole new set of}} challenges. This article describes the background and design of the new HP CaLan 3010 H and 3010 R sweep/ingress analyzer (see Figure 1), which enables cable television providers to do return path alignment in two-way cable systems and to troubleshoot the system quickly regardless of the presence of RF noise (ingress).

40|$|Context: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to define an appropriate quantitative method to evaluate the environmental quality affected by the location of antennas of base stations of mobile telephony near educative centers. This study is based on the method of Norbert Dee from Battel Columbus Laboratories. Method: For the development of the study, we took into account the most affected parts: number of species (both animals and plants), people, maximum levels of radiation, and the minimum allowed distance for the installation of antennas in Colombia. The study was conducted at a school in the city of Ocaña, located near an antenna base station for mobile <b>telephony.</b> For the <b>tests</b> we used surveys, the QGis software, and a high-frequency electromagnetic radiation measuring equipment (Spectran HF 60105. Aronia).   Results: As a result, we obtained six equations that help define the environmental quality index according to the mathematical relationship between the affected parts, the limit of location, and the radiation of mobile phone antennas permitted in any region. Conclusions: The proposed method allows measuring indices of environmental quality in educational centers affected by the location and function of antennas base stations of mobile telephony. Additionally, a quantitative method prevents the need to implement a subjective and unspecific evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Internet Telephony is an {{emerging}} and promising technology which enables {{the transport of}} voice over data networks. If {{it is going to}} be successful, standardization will be critical. The purpose of this study is to assess the suitability of the H. 323 standard for establishing and performing real time voice conversations over IP networks. The goals of the study were to: (1) examine the current status of Internet Telephony, (2) conduct research on the current Internet Telephony software solutions in terms of quality, performance, interoperability and H. 323 compliance, (3) analyze and evaluate the H. 323 standard, (4) compare H. 323 with Session Initiation Protocol, and (5) provide recommendations for further improvements of H. 323. The study shows the complexity of H. 323 and highlights the areas where more considerations are required. Part of the study includes the testing of 10 Internet <b>Telephony</b> programs. The <b>tests</b> show that H. 323 compliance does not guarantee interoperability and voice quality. Also it is shown that the standard is not yet mature despite its popularity. However, it is assessed that Internet Telephony is a technology which will experience tremendous expansion during the forthcoming years. Based on the analysis and evaluation results, recommendations are provided in order for the H. 323 to be more suitable for Internet Telephony[URL] Navy author...|$|R
