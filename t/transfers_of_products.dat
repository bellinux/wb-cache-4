An increasing body of evidence indicates that they play {{a pivotal role in}} cell-to-cell communication. Indeed, they may directly stimulate target cells by receptor-mediated interactions or may transfer from the cell of origin to various bioactive molecules including membrane receptors, proteins, mRNAs, microRNAs, and organelles. In this review we discuss the pleiotropic biologic effects of MVs that are relevant for communication among cells in physiological and pathological conditions.

If {{there is a need}} to supply a large–scale area with large number of customers, it is disadvantageous to deliver products from the only central warehouse or direct from producers. It is suitable to build up local distribution warehouses. The promptitude and quality of customer services improve as the number of warehouses increases. Transport cost created by <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> from producers to customers is reduced too. On the other hand, both the fixed costs caused by the warehouse operation and cost of maintenance of greater current, buffer and protective stocks increase all at once. The contribution is concerned with a common case of a location-allocation problem, which involves both the location of distribution centres or warehouses and an allocation of customers to warehouses. Warehouses receive products from production plants and distribute them to customers such as retail or wholesale outlets. The well-known Weiszfeld algorithm [1] was adapted for sequentially increasing number of warehouses until adding another warehouse is advantageous from transport cost standpoint. The basic criterion for decision is minimization of freight cost, but increasing expenses <b>of</b> <b>product</b> stocks are considered as well. Distances between warehouses and customers are given by a suitable two-dimensional metric corresponding to the network of routes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control and controllability approach {{for a general}} manufacturing transportation system. The system transports objects from a production unit to a stamping/packaging section. At arrival time, {{the position and velocity}} of every object must synchronize with the stamping device. The system constraints and a simplified model of the system dynamics are developed. The hybrid character of the system makes classical control approaches di#cult. A control scheme that controls interobject spacings and satisfies the constraints is proposed. A controllability analysis, independent from the control scheme and satisfying all constraints, shows the influence of system parameters on system controllability. Simulations verify the control scheme and controllability analysis. 1. Introduction Some production systems require timely arrival of produced objects at various stages of the production system.
