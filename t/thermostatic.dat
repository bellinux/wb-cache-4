40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the difficulties encountered in extending <b>thermostatics</b> to {{the description of}} irreversible processes in solid materials, and compares the resolutions proposed for them.

The discussion is in terms of the classical theory of irreversible processes. Basic concepts and results are compared with the more recent nonlinear field theory, employing memory functional representations. Finally, the role of internal variables is examined in bringing inelastic behavior {{within the framework of the}} classical theory.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the question of}} the definition of thermodynamic-like variables {{in the context of a}} statistical thermodynamics, which is a large generalization of Gibbs statistical <b>thermostatics</b> and linear and local-equilibrium classical irreversible thermodynamics. It is based on a nonequilibrium ensemble approach known as the nonequilibrium statistical operator method. Some of these quasithermodynamic variables are characteristic of the nonequilibrium state and go to zero in the limit of local or global equilibrium, but others go over the thermodynamic variables that are present in such a limit. We consider in particular temperature-like variables for the different subsystems of the sample. For illustration we apply the theory to the study of optical properties of highly photoexcited plasma in semiconductors, following a good agreement between theory and experimental data. It is shown that high-resolution spectroscopy provides an excellent experimental testing ground for corroboration of the theoretical concepts, and a quite appropriate way for characterizing and measuring nonequilibrium thermodynamic-like variables. © 1997 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{creation}} of structural hierarchies in open natural biosystems {{within the framework}} of quasi-closed systems is investigated by the methods of hierarchic thermodynamics (<b>thermostatics).</b> During the evolution of natural open systems, every higher hierarchic level j appears as a consequence of thermodynamic self-organization (self-assembly) of the structures of the lower (j- 1) -th level. Such a self-assembly proceeds as a result of stabilization of the j-th level. This is related to the Gibbs ` (Helmholtz`) specific function of formation {{of the structure of the}} j-th level tending to a minimum. As a result of action of the principle of substance (matter) stability, the structures of the j-th level are enriched with less stable structures of the (j- 1) -th level in the course of evolution. This provides a thermodynamic feedback between the structures of the higher j-th level and lower (j- 1) -th level, thus preventing full structural stabilization of the j-th level and causing "thermodynamic rejuvenation " of biosystems. The latter enhances "thermodynamic " deceleration of evolution and practically unlimited maintenance of life. Examples of quantitative correlations are provided that cal...|$|R
40|$|Ordinary {{thermodynamics}} provides reliable {{results when}} the thermodynamic fields are smooth, {{in the sense}} that there are no steep gradients and no rapid changes. In fluids and gases this is the domain of the equations of Navier-Stokes and Fourier. Extended thermodynamics becomes relevant for rapidly varying and strongly inhomogeneous processes. Thus the propagation of high­ frequency waves, and the shape of shock waves, and the regression of small-scale fluctuation are governed by extended thermodynamics. The field equations of ordinary thermodynamics are parabolic while extended thermodynamics is governed by hyperbolic systems. The main ingredients of extended thermodynamics are • field equations of balance type, • constitutive quantities depending on the present local state and • entropy as a concave function of the state variables. This set of assumptions leads to first order quasi-linear symmetric hyperbolic systems of field equations; it guarantees the well-posedness of initial value problems and finite speeds of propaga­ tion. Several tenets of irreversible thermodynamics had to be changed in subtle ways to make extended thermodynamics work. Thus, the entropy is allowed to depend on nonequilibrium vari­ ables, the entropy flux is a general constitutive quantity, and the equations for stress and heat flux contain inertial terms. New insight is therefore provided into the principle of material frame indifference. With these modifications an elegant formal structure can be set up in which, just as in classical <b>thermostatics,</b> all restrictive conditions [...] derived from the entropy principle-take the form of integrability conditions...|$|R
