5|$|On the December 27 {{episode of}} Raw, <b>The</b> <b>Nexus,</b> minus Barrett, {{announced}} {{they were under}} new management and offered to bury the hatchet with Cena, to which he refused. <b>The</b> <b>Nexus</b> attacked Cena, leaving a Nexus armband in the ring during the process. As the group retreated, CM Punk, who had attacked Cena with a steel chair twice the week before, came to the ring to apparently attack Cena, but instead put on the armband left behind to symbolically announce his allegiance with <b>The</b> <b>Nexus,</b> becoming leader the following week by manipulating Barrett's banishment from the group. On the January 17 episode of Raw, Cena returned and faced Punk in a match, which ended in a no contest after Cena was attacked by the debuting Mason Ryan, who later joined <b>The</b> <b>Nexus.</b> Cena competed in the 2011 Royal Rumble match at the pay-per-view, which saw Cena eliminate most of <b>the</b> <b>Nexus</b> members, ending his feud with the stable.|$|E
5|$|On the June 7, 2010 {{episode of}} Raw, Cena was {{suddenly}} thrust {{into a new}} storyline when during his main event match against CM Punk, he was attacked by all eight former contestants of the first season of NXT, with Wade Barrett as their leader. Punk, his follower Luke Gallows, and other personnel around the ring were attacked as well, but Cena took {{the worst of the}} attack and was carried out on a stretcher. This group later referred to itself as <b>The</b> <b>Nexus.</b> At Fatal 4-Way, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Sheamus, in a fatal four-way match involving Edge and Randy Orton, after <b>The</b> <b>Nexus</b> interfered. Cena again lost to Sheamus in a steel cage match at Money in the Bank, after <b>The</b> <b>Nexus</b> again interfered. Cena, in retaliation to <b>The</b> <b>Nexus,</b> formed an alliance with Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, R-Truth, The Great Khali, and Bret Hart. They defeated <b>The</b> <b>Nexus</b> at SummerSlam, with help from the returning Daniel Bryan, a former member of Nexus, who replaced Khali after he was injured.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Edge {{participated in}} the Raw Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, but failed to win the briefcase. Edge {{then went on to}} participate in the main event of SummerSlam in which he and six teammates were victorious in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match against <b>The</b> <b>Nexus.</b> On the 900th episode of Raw, he disqualified himself, in the main event in a five-on-five elimination match against <b>The</b> <b>Nexus.</b> This saw him enter into a feud with the anonymous Raw General Manager, during which the general manager cost him several matches. At Night of Champions, Edge participated in a six-pack elimination challenge for Sheamus' WWE Championship, but once again failed to win the title.|$|E

He {{took part in the}} interbrand tag team match at Bragging Rights after {{injuring}} Evan Bourne to win a place, but the team lost. It was reported later that he was suffering with a hip injury that would stop him from competing. To keep a presence on television, he began commentating on Raw from November 22, having already commentated one NXT. During his commentary, he criticized John Cena for his actions against <b>The</b> <b>Nexus.</b> Sometimes he favored heel wrestlers over face wrestlers. At the end of December, Punk left the commentary team after assaulting John Cena on Raw and SmackDown with a chair. Punk later revealed that his motives for the attacks were that he had joined and assumed control of <b>The</b> <b>Nexus.</b> Punk then made each member of the group prove themselves worthy of a spot, with some choosing to join The Corre, which had been started by former Nexus leader Wade Barrett on SmackDown, instead.|$|E

5|$|Punk {{then used}} {{the group to}} attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and <b>The</b> <b>Nexus</b> cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by taking {{out all of the}} New Nexus members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole {{surviving}} member of the group. This led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules, both of which Punk lost.|$|E

40|$|The United Nations {{has defined}} <b>the</b> food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> {{as a key}} issue in the green economy process towards {{sustainable}} development. The integrated assessment model is used here to frame and study the heterogeneity of <b>the</b> food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> and to manage <b>the</b> food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> in Germany in a social learning and decision-making process. For the integrated assessment of <b>the</b> German food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> sector, a four-phase approach based on the de Ridder method is used to analyse <b>the</b> food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> against <b>the</b> background of the completely revised German sustainability strategy of 2017. In the first step, the integrated assessment problem analysis, the interconnections of <b>the</b> food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> between <b>the</b> natural resources and the socio-economic system are formulated. The new political values and options needed {{for the management of}} <b>the</b> food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> sector are revealed in the second research step and it is stressed that justice is the defining ethical norm of the revised German sustainability strategy of 2017, which is the sustainability framework for <b>the</b> German food-energy-water <b>nexus.</b> Thus, inter- and intragenerational justice is also a central issue of <b>the</b> food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> and is integrated with the social discount rate in the food-energy-water measuring concept (Fisher nexus quantity index) presented in the third step. In the final research step of the integrated assessment approach, it is found that <b>the</b> new food-energy-water <b>nexus</b> policy process also needs a ‘culture of reflected numbers’, as Voßkuhle calls it, to ensure a social discourse as a permanent learning process for both the German government and society.  ...|$|R

Smith defeated Kidd in a singles match on the November 25 episode of WWE Superstars. Afterward, Smith offered to shake Kidd's hand, but Kidd refused and instead slapped him across the face. On the following episode of Raw, Kidd defeated Smith in a rematch, with this officially ending the alliance as a team.|$|E
5|$|After The Legacy disbanded, Orton unsuccessfully {{challenged}} Jack Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules in April. During {{a number}} one contender's {{match for the}} WWE Championship on Raw, Orton was speared by Edge, costing him the match and setting up a bout at Over the Limit, Orton separated his right shoulder during the match, which ended in a double countout. At Fatal 4-Way in June, Orton competed in a fatal four-way WWE Championship match involving champion Cena, Edge, and Sheamus, who won the title after interference from <b>The</b> <b>Nexus.</b> On July 18 at Money in the Bank, Orton competed in a Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE Championship contract, which was won by The Miz. The following night on Raw, he won a number one contender's match over Edge and Chris Jericho, earning a WWE Championship match against Sheamus at SummerSlam. Sheamus was disqualified for bringing a chair into the ring, giving Orton the win, but not the title. Immediately afterward, Orton hit Sheamus with the chair and an RKO onto the broadcast table.|$|E

40|$|This chapter takes a {{critical}} look at the sociological notion of ‘medicalisation’ in relation to recent trends and developments in neuroscience, neurotechnology and society, taking memory, medicine and the brain as our prime focus and the disease category of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as our empirical case study. Five relational nexuses in particular are identified as relevant to these developments and debates, namely <b>the</b> bio-psych <b>nexus,</b> <b>the</b> pharma-psych <b>nexus,</b> <b>the</b> selves-subjectivity <b>nexus,</b> <b>the</b> wellness-enhancement <b>nexus,</b> and <b>the</b> neuroculture-neurofuture <b>nexus.</b> We show that developments in memory medicine and the shifting boundaries of cognitive health, as embodied and expressed {{in the case of}} MCI, shed further valuable light on these issues and the interconnectivity of these relational nexuses. As an emergent disease and susceptibility category, MCI illuminates not only the fuzzy boundaries between normal and abnormal cognitive functioning, but also the working of neuroscientific, neurocultural and pharmacological interests, which, in this case, are already claiming MCI as the next locus of enhancing the mind and optimising aging. Thinking both within and beyond medicalisation challenges us {{to find new ways to}} critically understand the ideas about life and health as they travel, translate or migrate from (neuro) scientific and clinical spheres to cultural life and patient experience...|$|R

Following a hectic four-month development period during which the device was modified to reach a US$199 price point, mass production started in May. It was unveiled at the Google I/O annual developer conference on June27, when it also became available for pre-order through Google Play.

The great quantity of early Maya sculpture {{and the presence of}} early examples of Maya hieroglyphic writing suggest that the site played an important part in the development of Maya ideology. The origins of the Maya sculptural style may have developed in the Preclassic on the Pacific coast and Takalik Abaj's position at <b>the</b> <b>nexus</b> of key trade routes could have been important in the dissemination of the style across the Maya area.

5|$|Wes Gephart, {{though his}} {{personal}} brilliance {{and ability to}} attract investment, was able to cover the decline to some extent. By his death in 1905, he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces, extensive ore mines, and two railroads. But even during his lifetime, Bellefonte had seen {{the end of its}} glory: after 1890, its population, heretofore steadily growing, would decline for the next thirty years. Nor did Gephart's empire long survive him; little more than a decade after his death, the furnaces were demolished, the mines shut down, and one railroad scrapped. Only the Central Railroad remained, staggering to a pauper's grave in 1918, sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring. The era of Nittany Furnace was the twilight of ironmaking in Bellefonte. Though not fully apparent at the time, neither the rising lime industry nor any other would replace ironmaking as the guarantor of the town's prosperity. The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as <b>the</b> <b>nexus</b> of activity in Centre County.|$|E
