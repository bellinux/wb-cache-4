500|$|The group {{sent out}} demo tapes to record {{companies}} but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one-record contract, issuing their debut single, [...] "I Want <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>with</b> <b>You</b> Tonight", in 1977. GRT {{was more interested}} in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band, later shortened to Alabama. The song only reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label. For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979. Following self-recorded efforts Wildcountry (1976) and Deuces Wild (1977), Alabama Band No. 3 became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year. The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single [...] "I Wanna Come Over", and they sent hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide. It received the attention of Dallas-based MDJ Records, who signed the band. Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound. [...] "I Wanna Come Over", became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the Billboard country chart.|$|E

The song had {{originally}} appeared on Joe Cocker's 1970 album Mad Dogs & Englishmen, sung by Rita Coolidge. Karen {{was familiar with}} the album, but Richard first heard the song when it was covered by Bette Midler on The Tonight Show, and realised its potential as a Carpenters hit. The duo changed the line [...] "I can hardly wait to sleep with you again" [...] to [...] "... <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> again", as they knew the former would not be played on Top 40 radio. The single sold a million copies, attaining gold status, and became the Carpenters' third No.2 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (this time held off the top spot by Rod Stewart's [...] "Maggie May" [...] / [...] "Reason to Believe"). On May 14, 1971, the Carpenters performed a sell-out show at Carnegie Hall, and they released their third album, Carpenters the same day. It became one of their best sellers, earning RIAA certification for platinum four times, and rising to No. 2 on Billboards pop album chart for two weeks (behind Carole King's Tapestry) with over a million pre-sales orders. The album won a Grammy Award, as well as receiving three nominations. Shortly after this, the duo recorded a short television series, Make Your Own Kind of Music, which drew mixed reviews.|$|E

[...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. I just like to pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't know about this guy. The show's tough enough {{to get off the}} ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to look at our options as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso.
