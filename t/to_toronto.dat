5|$|This road {{would serve}} as the initial mail road linking Kingston <b>to</b> <b>Toronto,</b> but was poorly {{maintained}} and soon allowed to fall into disrepair. By 1817, the Kingston Road replaced or bypass much of Danforth's Road, following a similar path to the Trent River (with minor improvements in routing around Scarborough, Port Hope, Cobourg and Grafton) but then blazing a more northerly route through Belleville and Napanee. Like the Danforth Road before it, this 1817 York Road was initially a muddy dirt road; it would, however, suffice to establish reliable scheduled stagecoach runs by which mail and passengers could make the two-day trip from Kingston <b>to</b> <b>Toronto</b> and permit enterprises (such as {{the branches of the}} newly established Bank of Montreal) safe and timely delivery of documents and valuables. By 1839, the Napanee-Kingston route was being improved for use as a gravel toll road.|$|E

5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home <b>to</b> <b>Toronto</b> to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England.
