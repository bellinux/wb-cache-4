500|$|When Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) {{is asked}} to look after Mrs. Lauder's (Nan Martin) prize-winning Hungarian Puli, he decides to pass the task on to his {{employee}} Drew (Drew Carey). Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) offers to take the dog, Lucky, to Drew's house; but she has to leave suddenly {{to pick up her}} boyfriend Oswald (Diedrich Bader). Drew does not see Kate's note and assumes Lucky is a stray. He takes it to the vet to get it shaved and neutered. When Kate sees the dog, she fears that she, Drew and Mr. Wick will be fired. She finds an advertisement for a pure bred Hungarian Puli, but it costs $4,500. Since no one has <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> Oswald suggests they sell their bodies for money. Inspired by The Full Monty, the guys decide to perform a striptease at The Warsaw Tavern to make the money they need. Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) backs out of the performance at the last minute, but Larry Almada (Ian Gomez) steps in as his replacement.|$|E

5000|$|A {{major factor}} in this {{development}} was the greater distances between cities, with some teams separated by {{at least half the}} continent, which in turn resulted in higher traveling costs. When the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs was established in 1876, its founders judged that in order to prosper, they must make baseball's highest level of competition a [...] "closed shop", with a strict limit on the number of teams, and with each member having exclusive local rights. This guarantee of a place in the league year after year would permit each club owner to monopolize fan bases in their respective exclusive territories and give them the confidence to invest in infrastructure, such as improved ballparks. This in turn would guarantee the revenues needed to support traveling across the continent. With the introduction of TV exposure and other sources of increased revenue during the 20th century, team owners have no incentive to risk giving up this annual income in favor of establishing an [...] "open shop system" [...] where they could be relegated to a lower league that does not generate <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> lucrative <b>money.</b> There has been discussion on Major League Soccer trying to adopt promotion and relegation, but MLS is currently not pursuing the option, based on team control on TV rights.|$|R

40|$|The {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{economic stimulus}} package starts to bring Australia into line with its international counterparts, writes ADAM RORRIS   UNTIL A DEAL was struck with the small party and independent senators, Malcolm Turnbull’s decision to oppose the federal government’s {{economic stimulus package}} was putting at risk a {{once in a lifetime}} opportunity to improve education in Australia. Why? Because this is a moment when we can begin to re-imagine and then build the schools that we want for our children and grandchildren in this century. These new public facilities will {{stand the test of time}} and will be seen in fifty or even a hundred years as evidence of our dedication to the education of all our children. The federal government announcement to inject nearly 15 billion into the rebuilding of Australian schools is much more than a major renovation job. Yes, investment will save thousands of jobs. It will help many builders and suppliers right across the country keep their heads above the rising waters of insolvency. Every community has a school and this money (and therefore the jobs that will be created by it) will be spread widely across the country. These are no mean achievements when we need to do all we can to ward off the effects of recession in all of our communities. But the true significance of this initiative for our country is that it begins to rectify in a serious manner the massive under-investment by governments in Australian public schools. In the broader sweep of our country’s social development, this massive investment may well be remembered as the first big step towards a renaissance in Australian schooling. I have built a career out of deciphering millions and billions of dollars and what they really mean when it comes to education. It is all too easy for ministers and governments to talk of billions and sound impressive when it comes to elections or budgets or quadrennial agreements. But in reality, and all too often, they offer very little that is either new or above what is already spent. So let me assure you, this investment is the mother of all school investment programs. Yes, it really is new money and it is very big. What is important to know is this - it needs to be. The under-investment in our public schools has been accumulating for at least a couple of decades. A great many schools have been allowed to run down. Emblematic for many parents and teachers have been the dreaded demountables. Research I conducted last year confirmed that public schools had a legitimate gripe when they compared themselves with their private counterparts. Data analysis spanning five years showed the average public school to be receiving a little over a third of what the average private school was allocating for capital expenditures. Not good for kids and not exactly a level playing field. This year I compared Australian public schools with their public school counterparts in Britain and the United States. The key finding (presented in a forthcoming Centre for Policy Development publication) is that over the same five year period (2002 - 06) public schools in both of those countries received the equivalent of nearly 1000 extra per student to invest in capital improvements. In fact, the per student amount these countries were spending was very close to the average capital expenditure per private school student in Australia. If Australian public schools had received the same level of funding per student as American and British public schools, they would have received more than 10 billion extra in additional funds over that same five year period. It just so happens that public schools stand to gain approximately 11 billion <b>of</b> the new <b>money</b> being promised by the Federal government. This is one very big hit of additional funding to rectify five years of relative neglect. This is not substantially different from the 2004 Blair government promise to spend 110 billion over 15 years in rebuilding every secondary school in Britain. Similarly, Barack Obama has pledged the equivalent of 33 billion in additional federal money for urgent capital improvements to American schools. The federal opposition leader seems to think that Australian schools are too high on the priority list of the government. In his speech to parliament he even suggested that perhaps 1 billion a year for schools would be enough. My research over the past year makes very clear <b>that</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> would not be anywhere near enough for our public schools, let alone the private sector. We need first rate schools, for children to be capable in meeting the formidable challenges of the new century and to operate from a position of advantage in the global marketplace. Our schools really couldn’t keep on doing more with less. • Adam Rorris, is an economist and research fellow with the Centre for Policy Development.
