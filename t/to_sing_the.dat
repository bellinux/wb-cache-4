In November 2004, Olivia Ong, an 18-year-old Singaporean based in Tokyo, sang Majulah Singapura at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifying rounds at Saitama Stadium in Saitama, Japan.|$|E
5|$|Absolute {{structured}} {{the song}} using doo-wop records as a template. The format was for Emma Bunton <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> high part, Melanie Brown, Victoria Beckham, and Halliwell singing the lower and middle parts, and Chisholm adding the ad-libs. The song {{was recorded in}} a caravan {{in the middle of}} mayhem. Wilson and Watkins doggedly worked on it with whichever of the group's members were available from the filming set at any given point. A considerable amount of production work was required afterward before the track reached its final form.|$|E
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues <b>to</b> <b>sing,</b> <b>the</b> nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "My Heart Is a Flower," [...] a pop rock {{track with}} {{elements}} of psychedelic rock, frontman John S. Hall repeatedly <b>sings</b> <b>the</b> titular phrase, recites a short monologue expanding on the heart-as-flower metaphor, then returns <b>to</b> <b>singing</b> <b>the</b> titular phrase {{as the music}} crescendoes.|$|R

5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Rihanna is walking towards a {{dressing}} room mirror while {{preparing for a}} show. This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant. While they talk to each other, Rihanna's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some time, during which Rihanna watches the other tables. One diner writes a note and gives it to a waiter, who passes it to Rihanna, who reads and quickly hides the note as her boyfriend returns to the table. Rihanna starts <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> song's lyrics while she leaves the dressing room and approaches the stage, where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage. The arena is empty and it appears as though Rihanna is rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega {{performed}} as the pre-game act, and Billy Joel sang the National Anthem, accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was {{played at the}} same venue. Joel became the second person <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> National Anthem twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the national anthem before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last time until Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male artist had sung the national anthem at a Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, Santos toured the United States and Latin-America, while {{experiencing}} health problems. He continued performing with several music groups. While he performed with the Sonora Matancera, Santos suffered a heart attack while he was sleeping in a hotel located in La Reforma after eating dinner. Santos continued performing during the following decades, making presentations in several Latin American countries. He continued <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> songs which he had written during his career until he finally retired and established a residence in Florida.|$|E
50|$|In 1997-98, U2 {{frequently}} {{performed the}} song as a karaoke version <b>sung</b> by <b>The</b> Edge during the Popmart Tour.

5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E
5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{in the summer}} of 2004, President Putin chastised the national football team for their behavior during the playing of the anthem. During the opening ceremonies of the 2004 European Football Championship, the team was caught on camera chewing gum during the Russian anthem. Through Leonid Tyagachev, then head of the Russian Olympic Committee, Putin told the team to stop chewing gum and <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> anthem. Gennady Shvets, then the Russian Olympic Committee's press chief, denied being contacted by the Kremlin but said he was aware of displeasure with the players' behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{remained}} at the Saint Macrina monastery, where many close disciples, both monks and secular people, gathered around him. At Saint Macrina he was free of monks who were averse to his discipline and zeal, and free from direct conflict with church authorities. He continued to honor Symeon the Studite—most of the clergy from Constantinople, along with many monks and laymen, joined him during those celebrations. He also wrote during that time and made himself accessible to all who wanted to see him. Symeon spent the last thirteen {{years of his life}} in exile, dying from dysentery on March 12, 1022. According to his biographer and disciple, Nicetas, Symeon foretold his own death many years previously, and on his last day called together all the monks <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> funeral hymns.|$|E

Selected contestants from the first stage {{then moved on to}} the second stage, where they had <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> for <b>The</b> Voice Kids head vocal coach, Lindsay Field. The last stage of the auditions required <b>the</b> contestants <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> for <b>the</b> show's executive producers.|$|R

5|$|The first Bishop of Wells was Athelm (909), who crowned King Æthelstan. Athelm and {{his nephew}} Dunstan both became Archbishops of Canterbury. During this period a choir of boys was {{established}} <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> liturgy. Wells Cathedral School, {{which was established}} to educate these choirboys, dates its foundation to this point. There is, however, some controversy over this. Following the Norman Conquest, Bishop John de Villula moved {{the seat of the}} bishop from Wells to Bath in 1090. The church at Wells, no longer a cathedral, had a college of secular clergy.|$|E
5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} anthem is regularly performed or sung {{in schools and}} armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or {{the end of each}} day, during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the national pledge is taken.

5|$|The {{range of}} the Eurasian {{treecreeper}} overlaps with that of several other treecreepers, which can present local identification problems. In Europe, the Eurasian treecreeper shares much of its range with the short-toed treecreeper. Compared to that species, it is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter supercilium and slightly shorter bill. Visual identification, even in the hand, may be impossible for poorly marked birds. A singing treecreeper is usually identifiable, since short-toed treecreeper has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding {{quite different from the}} song of Eurasian treecreeper; however, both species have been known <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> other's song.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by British directing duo James Frost & Alex of The Artists Company. It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the telecine process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted the amount of lighting for blue in the beginning, red in the middle, and yellow {{at the end of}} the video.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé then {{sings the}} chorus again and dances in her red dress {{in front of}} the background. Mc Lyte and Free are seen at a {{backyard}} barbecue party as Mc Lyte's verse begins and she mingles with the party guests, with Elliott as the party DJ. Again, Beyoncé comes back <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>the</b> chorus of the song, now at the barbecue party, with scenes of her dancing in a room of the mansion and scenes from the movie in which she is singing on a stage in front of a large audience with a group of people behind her. With the end of the final chorus, the song moves back to Elliott and Lyte, with the former on her rollerskates as in the beginning and the latter {{in front of the}} semi-circle of men. The video ends with the four of them sitting at a picnic table at the barbecue party as two small girls clap hands on the opposite bench.|$|E
