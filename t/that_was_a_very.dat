500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined {{the nature of this}} homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E

So that's terrible guilt obviously – because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I {{was surprised}} when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [...] – that it was a baby swap." [...] Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: [...] "Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is."

2500|$|While {{the ships}} were being repaired, Jones {{had to deal}} with the {{consequences}} of landing in a neutral port with prizes of war. He turned on the charm for diplomatic negotiations at The Hague and networking in Amsterdam, where he was the toast of society, known as [...] "The Terror of the English". On 8 October, the British ambassador, Sir Joseph Yorke, wrote to the rulers of the United Provinces, claiming that under international law, Jones, not being accredited by a recognised state, was a rebel and a pirate. Therefore, the two captured ships should be detained for handing back to their rightful owners. Yorke also asked that the wounded from the two ships should be taken ashore and treated at British Government expense. That request was agreed to immediately, but it was over a fortnight later, during which repair work proceeded without any hindrance, when the Dutch replied that their neutrality meant they could not judge the legality of actions between foreigners on the open sea, but that that would also apply to any attempt made by the British to retake their ships once they left port. Furthermore, Jones’s squadron was obliged to leave the Texel [...] "as soon as possible", and could not be supplied with arms or ammunition except [...] "what are absolutely necessary to carry [...] them safe to the first foreign port they can come at". Yorke replied by quoting treaties, returning to the [...] "pirate" [...] theme, and pointing out that under Dutch law, commanders of foreign naval forces were obliged to present authorisation from their governments when docking in Dutch ports. As the United Provinces did not officially recognise the government of the United States, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> tricky legal point, which the Dutch took quite a while to consider. To get round the problem, Pallas and Vengeance were declared officially French, and Captain Cottineau became commodore of a French squadron, his flagship the captured Serapis. With Landais barred from command until the case against him could be heard, Jones became captain of the avowedly American Alliance, not associated in any way with the newly French squadron. Several Royal Navy ships were waiting just off the coast for the day he was obliged to leave—the Dutch authorities making a great show of trying to eject him—but as winter storms made it more and more difficult for them to keep station, John Paul Jones (after recruiting another American commander, Gustavus Conyngham, who had escaped from British captivity) slipped away among a group of Dutch ships on 27 December and sailed to France.|$|E
