5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a <b>typical</b> <b>farm.</b> Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E

500|$|The {{house in}} which Joseph Foraker was born was a {{comfortable}} two-story residence; his later campaign publications often depicted it as a log cabin. [...] When Joseph was age 2, David Reece died, and the Foraker family purchased the mill and adjacent farm. [...] There, Joseph grew up as a <b>typical</b> <b>farm</b> boy. He received little formal education, attending the local school {{for three or four}} months each winter. [...] Nevertheless, young Joseph acquired a taste for military history, and a gift for speaking. [...] He also became interested in politics; at age 10, he became an adherent of the newly formed Republican Party. [...] Four years later, he supported the Republican candidate, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln, in the 1860 presidential race, marching in processions of the Wide Awakes and other pro-Lincoln groups, and attending as many rallies as he could. Impressed enough by one speaker to follow him to a neighboring town, he learned not to make the same speech twice in two days—at least, not in venues close to each other.|$|E

At the time, farm work was extremely arduous, because on the <b>typical</b> <b>farm</b> virtually nothing could get done without manual labour or animal labour as the motive power. As his interest in automobiles grew, he also expressed a desire to [...] "lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood and place it on steel and motors." [...] In the early 20th century, he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components. Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903, Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit, referring to it as the [...] "Automobile Plow". Approximately 600 gasoline-powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908.

50|$|EPDs {{are used}} in both {{scientific}} research and in <b>typical</b> <b>farm</b> usage. Through mathematical equations and computing power EPDs can be generated for use in both situations.

By using certain EPDs of an animal one can rapidly improve genetics of a herd, especially for highly heritable traits such as marbling. In addition, by {{using a combination of}} EPDs and DNA markers, EPDs can be made more accurate. When new DNA markers are used, they can help adjust the EPD according to the genotype and therefore produce a more accurate measurement.|$|E
