5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for <b>the</b> <b>cabbage,</b> it is slower to recover than <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> itself.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} times, Māori had a rich {{knowledge of}} <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. While {{much of that}} specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, {{the use of the}} tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is becoming more common.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The appearance of <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> head {{has been given}} importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E

5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> Lundy <b>cabbage</b> flea beetle or <b>the</b> bronze Lundy <b>cabbage</b> flea beetle, is a species of flea beetle endemic to the island of Lundy, where it lives and feeds upon <b>the</b> endemic Lundy <b>cabbage</b> (Coincya wrightii). Along with the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of flea beetle Psylliodes napi, it is known only from <b>the</b> Lundy <b>cabbage.</b> <b>The</b> species was first recorded by Thomas Vernon Wollaston in the 1840s, and was named by the Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864.|$|R
5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy {{rhizomes}} of C.australis {{are high in}} natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a large type of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> tree were harvested.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for {{products}} such as <b>the</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E

5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other Cordyline species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: Cordyline australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, {{and a range of}} variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other Cordyline species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> tree moth.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cabbage</b> tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E
25|$|Holishkes, stuffed cabbage, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>cabbage</b> roll, is also a European Jewish dish that emerged from more impoverished times for Jews. Because having a live cow was more {{valuable}} than to eat meat in the Middle Ages, Jews used fillers such as breadcrumbs and vegetables to mix with ground beef.

5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{is found}} {{throughout}} the highly limited range of <b>the</b> Lundy <b>cabbage,</b> including sheer sea cliffs and further inland at Millcombe House.

It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate <b>the</b> Lundy <b>cabbage,</b> but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination.|$|R
