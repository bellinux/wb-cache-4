5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>Stripes</b> in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.|$|E

25|$|On some U.S. {{military}} uniforms, flag patches {{are worn}} {{on the right}} shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front.

As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>Stripes</b> are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.
