Based on comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of three protein-coding genes (RNA polymerase II subunit gene, rpb 2; elongation factor 1 -α gene, ef 1 -α; and ß tubulin gene, bt) and ribosomal DNA in the internal transcribed spacer region, we have demonstrated that the initial trapping structure evolved along two lineages yielding two distinct trapping mechanisms: one developed into constricting rings and the other developed into adhesive traps.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for conserving a biological deep-sea organism, comprises collecting the biological organism in a deep-sea <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> (110), cooling the biological organism with a cooling device (120), where the biological organism is put in a frozen condition, moving the frozen biological organism with the <b>trapping</b> <b>device,</b> to a normal-pressure environment, detecting the biological organism in the <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> and/or supplying a cryoprotectant in the <b>trapping</b> <b>device,</b> dismantling the biological organism in frozen condition under normal pressure, and thawing or cultivating the biological organism or a part of biological organism under normal pressure or high pressure. The biological organism is frozen together with sea water (2) in a chamber of the <b>trapping</b> <b>device.</b> The biological organism is collected by alluring and/or actively flushing the biological organism in the <b>trapping</b> <b>device.</b> The cooling is carried out by introducing a liquid cooling medium in a hollow interior wall of the <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> and/or forming a thermal contact of the cooling medium over a thermal bridge with an internal wall of the <b>trapping</b> <b>device.</b> The introduction of the liquid cooling medium is carried out by changing a liquid filling medium from the hollow interior wall of the <b>trapping</b> <b>device.</b> The cooling is enabled to a determined cool advent. The cooling is actuated dependent upon a signal of a sensor arrangement. The movement of the <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> is carried out through lift that is caused through a transfer of cooling medium in a gaseous condition.

40|$|Acoustofluidics {{utilizes}} {{a combination}} of acoustics, {{in the form of}} ultrasound, and microfluidics to manipulate cells and particles. This {{has proven to be a}} versatile method that is gentle to the cells. In this thesis acoustofluidics has been used for processing rare cells in continuous flow. Rare cells are within this thesis defined as cells that are present in numbers of 1 - 1000 per mL in a much larger population of background cells. Rare cells present in blood have been of particular interest, and cancer cells and bacteria have been used as model cells. In this thesis acoustofluidics has first been used to concentrate cells. This was done by using two-dimensional focusing and a multistage acoustofluidic device where sequential concentration steps, generating moderate concentration factors, could be multiplied into large concentration factors. The usefulness of the method was then extended as the critical particle focusing size was lowered to also allow focusing of bacteria. This was done through using two-dimensional focusing, which was shown to change the acoustic streaming pattern to no longer counteract the primary acoustic radiation force. The new critical particle focusing size was determined to be between 0. 5 μm and 0. 24 μm in particle diameter for polystyrene-like particles. In the third paper a simplyfied acoustofluidic device, that does not rely on a clean fluid sheath flow to prealign the cells or particles before the separation, was presented. To be able to do this the device used only two-dimensional focusing to prealign the cells. The usefulness of the device was in turn demonstrated with the separation of cancer cells from white blood cells where it was shown to perform comparably to previously presented devices. In the fourth paper a separation method was combined with the concentration method presented in the first paper on an integrated device. The device was shown to be able to simultaneously separate and concentrate cancer cells from white blood cells. Finally, the previously proposed concentration device was integrated with a DEP single cell <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> further showing the usefulness of the acoustofluidic method. Standing alone, the DEP <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> could only process sample at a flow rate of 4 μL/min while still maintaining a high trapping efficiency. By integrating the DEP <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> with the acoustofluidic concentrator device a higher sample inflow rate could be used as the acoustofluidic device could gear down the flow rate before the sample entered the DEP <b>trapping</b> <b>device.</b> Together samples could be processed ~ 10 times faster than using the DEP <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> alone, while still recovering over 90 % of the cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{off-line}} coupling of an isoelectric <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> termed membrane separated wells for {{isoelectric focusing}} and trapping (MSWIFT) to mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies is described. The MSWIFT {{is a high}} capacity, high-throughput, mass spectrometry-compatible isoelectric <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> that provides isoelectric point (pI) -based separations of complex mixtures of peptides. In MSWIFT, separation and analyte trapping are achieved by migrating the peptide ions through membranes having fixed pH values until the peptide pI is bracketed by the pH values of adjacent membranes. The pH values of the membranes can be tuned, thus affording {{a high degree of}} experimental flexibility. Specific advantages of using MSWIFT for sample prefractionation include: (1) small sample volumes (∼ 200 μL), (2) customized membranes over a large pH range, (3) flexibility in the number of desired fractions, (4) membrane compatibility with a variety of solvents systems, and (5) resulting fractions do not require sample cleanup before MS analysis. Here, we demonstrate the utility of MSWIFT for mass spectrometry-based detection of peptides in improving dynamic range and the reduction of ion suppression effects for high-throughput separations of tryptic peptides...|$|E

40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatases (PTPs) {{are involved}} in the regulation of many aspects of cellular activity including proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, migration, and survival. Given the large number and complexity of PTPs in cell signaling, new strategies are needed for the integrated analysis of PTPs in the whole proteome. Unfortunately, the activities of many PTPs are tightly regulated by posttranslational mechanisms, limiting the utility of standard genomics and proteomics methods for functional characterization of these enzymes. To facilitate the global analysis of PTPs, we designed and synthesized two activity-based probes that consist of α-bromobenzylphosphonate as a PTP-specific <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> and a linker that connects the <b>trapping</b> <b>device</b> with a biotin tag for visualization and purification. We showed that these probes are active site-directed irreversible inactivators of PTPs and form a covalent adduct with PTPs involving the active site Cys residue. Additionally, we demonstrated that the probes are extremely specific toward PTPs while remaining inert to other proteins, including the whole proteome from Escherichia coli. Consequently, these activity-based PTP probes can be used to profile PTP activity in complex proteomes. The ability to interrogate the entire PTP family on the basis of changes in their activity should greatly accelerate both the assignment of PTP function and the identification of potential therapeutic targets...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{evanescent}} waveguides with a subwavelength core thickness {{present a}} promising lab-on-chip solution for generating nanovolume trapping sites using overlapping evanescent fields. In this work, we experimentally studied Si 3 N 4 waveguides whose sub-wavelength cross-sections and high aspect ratios support fundamental and higher order modes {{at a single}} excitation wavelength. Due to differing modal effective indices, these co-propagating modes interfere and generate beating patterns with significant evanescent field intensity. Using near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), we map the structure of these beating modes in three dimensions. Our results demonstrate the potential of NSOM to optimize waveguide design for complex field <b>trapping</b> <b>devices.</b> By reducing the in-plane width, the population of competing modes decreases, resulting in a simplified spectrum of beating modes, such that waveguides with a width of 650 nm support three modes with two observed beats.
