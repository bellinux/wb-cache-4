40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} rhetorical imaginary of internetworked societies by examining three cases where {{actors in the}} blogosphere shaped public deliberation. In each case, I analyze a trope that emerged organically as bloggers theorized their own rhetorical interventions, and argue that these tropes signal shifts in how citizens of networked societies imagine their relations. The first case study, on the blogosphere's reaction to <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott's</b> 2002 toast to Strom Thurmond, examines how bloggers "flooded the zone" by relentlessly interpreting the event and finding evidence that eventually turned the tide of public opinion against Lott. Flooding the zone signifies the inventional possibilities of blogging through the production of copious public argument. The second case study, focusing on the 2003 blogging of the Salam Pax, an English-speaking Iraqi living in Iraq on the precipice of war, develops the idea of "ambient intimacy" which is produced through the affective economy of blogging. The ambient intimacy produced through blogging illustrates the blurring of traditional public/private distinctions in contemporary public culture. The third case study, on the group science blog RealClimate, identifies how blogs have become sites for translating scientific controversies into ordinary language {{through a process of}} "shallow quotation. " The diffusion of expertise enabled by the interactive format of blogging provides new avenues to close the gap between public and technical reasoning. The dissertation concludes by examining the advent and implications of "hyperpublicity" produced by ubiquitous recording devices and digital modes of circulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the often}} heated debate over {{campaign}} finance reform, few events have generated more heat than Senate Majority Leader <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott's</b> selection of Professor Bradley A. Smith for a GOP {{seat on the}} Federal Election Commission. Critics called Smith, a noted expert on campaign finance, "unfit" to serve, his selection "an insult. " Someone on the FEC with his views, said one critic, is "unthinkable. " Given that opposition, President Clinton has thus far refused to nominate Smith. In response, the GOP has put a hold on Clinton's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations. What is Smith's "crime"? In his scholarly writings, he has challenged the conventional wisdom by arguing that past campaign finance reforms have made the system worse and that most proposed reforms {{would do the same}} [...] and, more important, would violate the First Amendment. He urges an end to limits on both contributions and spending [...] but with full disclosure. Although Smith's critics call him "radical," their attack has raised a question: Just who is the radical? For in case after case, the courts have been on Smith's side, not {{on the side of his}} critics. Indeed, what his critics plainly fear is that Smith, on the FEC, will not be "radical" enough, will not press the "robust enforcement" the courts have repeatedly struck down. For his part, Smith has said he will enforce the law, but he will not waste the tax-payers' money pursuing unconstitutional enforcement theories. His selection is a breath of fresh air that should bring needed balance to the campaign finance debate...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1998 piece L. Brent Bozell III (the {{head of the}} {{conservative}} watchdog Media Research Center) took issue with Miller's politics while dismissing his 1996 {{claim to be a}} [...] "conservative libertarian" [...] saying Miller [...] "hasn't a clue about the meaning of either term." [...] To advance his argument he pointed to Miller's quote [...] "When it comes to paranoia, most folks more concerned with the federal government... but I'm made more paranoid by corporations. Car companies that lie about their safety records; chemical firms selling toxic weed killers that wind up in our food... Let's face it, the idiots in Washington, D.C. can't even investigate a conspiracy, much less create one." [...] Bozell held that it was impossible for a true libertarian to fear the private sector more than the public sector. As late as July 11, 2000, Bozell stated that while Miller's jabs against Hillary Clinton proved he was no Democrat, reviewing his statements on his HBO program [...] "there's not an impartial bone in his body". Bozell complained that in 1992 Miller [...] "likened Pat Buchanan to a Nazi". He said Miller told [...] "slimy barbs" [...] and [...] "vicious 'jokes'" [...] in late 1994 about Newt Gingrich, such as [...] "text Contract with America about his political vision for the future of America be available through the Mein Kampf of the Month Club." [...] Bozell also took issue with Miller defining moderate Republican as [...] "someone who refers to blacks as 'coloreds.'" [...] Bozell complained of Miller's jokes against <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott's</b> opposition to legalizing homosexuality, his satire of the NRA's uncompromising political position, and his suggestion that the GOP was insincere in their desire to end teen pregnancy because its prevalence granted them the votes of social conservatives. Bozell also took issue with Miller's describing Rush Limbaugh's show as one that [...] "barely educates also reinforces the narrow-minded prejudices of both the host and the listener." [...] He concluded that Miller being hired by ABC for Monday Night Football was proof that the network was biased, and the lack of public outcry over this bias was a proof of the decline of popular culture.|$|R

25|$|With the {{dramatic}} rise in gasoline prices during 2007–08, Amtrak has seen record ridership. Capping a steady five-year increase in ridership overall, regional lines saw 12% year-over-year growth in May 2008. In October 2007, the Senate passed S-294, Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act of 2007 (70–22) sponsored by Senators Frank Lautenberg and <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott.</b> Despite a veto threat by President Bush, a similar bill passed the House on June 11, 2008, with a veto-proof margin (311–104).

He lost to Harrison County sheriff Larkin I. Smith by almost 10 points. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee offered very little help to Taylor, believing the district to be too heavily Republican. Vice President George H. W. Bush beat Michael Dukakis by approximately a 70 to 30 margin in the district, and Lott beat Wayne Dowdy by a similar margin in the Senate race. Although about 30,000 Bush and Lott voters split their tickets to vote for Taylor, he could not overcome the Republican tide in the district.|$|E
25|$|An early {{milestone}} {{in the rise}} in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott.</b> Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States {{would have been better}} off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of the Patriot Act was {{introduced}} into the House on October 2, 2001 as the Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001, and was later passed by the House as the Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act (H.R. 2975) on October 12. This {{was based on the}} afore-mentioned Anti-Terrorism Act, but had been changed after negotiations and work between Attorney General Ashcroft, Senators Leahy, Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Bob Graham, <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott</b> (R-MS) and Orrin Hatch. It was introduced into the Senate as the USA Act of 2001 (S. 1510) by Tom Daschle (D-SD) where Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) proposed a number of amendments, none of which were passed. Feingold amended the provision relating to interception of computer trespasser communications, limited the roving wiretap authority under FISA and modified the provisions relating to access to business records under FISA. The USA Act was later vitiated and indefinitely postponed, because the Senate and House bills could not be reconciled in time.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{following}} passage of {{federal civil rights}} legislation in the mid-1960s and enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government, {{the influence of the}} Councils had waned considerably yet remained an institutional basis for the majority of white residents in Mississippi. The successor organization to the White Citizens' Councils is the St. Louis-based Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985 to continue collaborations between Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist political agendas in the United States. Republican politician and past Senate Majority Leader <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott</b> of Mississippi was a member while North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms and Georgia Congressman Bob Barr were both strong supporters of the Council of Conservative Citizens; David Duke also spoke at a fund raising event, while Patrick Buchanan's campaign manager was linked to both Duke and the Council. In 1996, a Charleston, SC, drive-by shooting by Klan members of three African American males occurred after a Council rally; Dylann Roof, responsible for the 2015 murder of nine Emanuel AME church members in Charleston, espoused Council of Conservative Citizens rhetoric in a manifesto.|$|E
25|$|Roger Wicker, {{formerly}} {{the representative of}} Mississippi's 1st congressional district, was appointed by Governor Haley Barbour on December 31, 2007, to fill the vacancy caused by the December 18 resignation of <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott.</b> It had been speculated that Lott wished to resign before a new lobbying reform law, effective {{the first day of}} 2008, took effect; having resigned before the end of 2007, Lott may become a lobbyist in 2009 instead of 2010. Controversy arose when Barbour called for the special election to be held on the same day as the general election. As a result, Mississippi's Attorney General Jim Hood challenged Barbour in court, claiming that the special election needed to be held within 100 days of Lott's resignation, as per state law. Initially, a Mississippi Circuit Court judge sided with Hood, ruling that the election take place on or before March 19, 2008. However, Barbour filed an appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which overturned the earlier ruling and set the special election for November 4, 2008.|$|E

D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year, helped move Republican leadership. Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott</b> scheduled the vote. With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch, Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote. She received her commission on October 7. [...] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: [...] "That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [...] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today." ...|$|E

Kemp's official role was as the chairman of the platform subcommittee on foreign policy. [...] However, the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes, the gold standard {{and the role of the}} Federal Reserve. Despite Kemp's official role, his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes. By 1985, Kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 Presidential nomination. He also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. Despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain, Kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban Western New York district until well into his eighth term in Congress.|$|E

This poem, and the collection in which it was included, is described by one critic as [...] "one more mark in modern Black radical and revolutionary cultural reconstruction." [...] Princeton University poetry professor Craig Dworkin, said that he did not like the poem, but added [...] "I do like the sense that a poet can be disturbing and not necessarily comforting or consensus-building." [...] Immediately after its public reading, the poem met with harsh criticism by literary critics, politicians, and the public. The poem is highly critical of racism in America, and includes angry depictions of public figures such as Rudolph Giuliani, <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott,</b> Clarence Thomas, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Ward Connerly. [...] It was also considered anti-Semitic because of lines claiming Israel's involvement in the World Trade Center attacks, and supporting the theory that the United States government knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance.|$|E
