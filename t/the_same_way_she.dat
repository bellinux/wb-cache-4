5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, closeted gay Mormon and Republican Joe Pitt, a {{law clerk}} {{in the same}} judge's office where Louis holds a {{clerical}} job, is offered a position in Washington, D.C., by his mentor, the McCarthyist lawyer Roy Cohn. Joe hesitates to accept {{out of concern for}} his agoraphobic wife Harper, who refuses to move. Harper suspects that Joe does not love her in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> loves him, which is confirmed when Joe confesses his homosexuality. Harper retreats into a drug-fueled escapist fantasy, including a dream where she crosses paths with Prior even though the two of them have never met in the real world. Joe's conservative mother Hannah arrives in New York, where she finds that in reality Harper has been wandering the streets of the city while Joe begins an affair with Louis. Denying her son's homosexuality, Hannah instead tries to force a reconciliation between Harper and Joe.|$|E
25|$|Seishirō {{encounters}} Subaru for {{one final}} {{fight in the}} Rainbow Bridge. After some time of fighting, Seishirō heads in for the finishing blow. Hokuto's final spell takes effect, leaving Subaru with his hand through Seishirō's chest, killing the Sakurazukamori instead. Hokuto's final wish was Subaru could not be killed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was. Seishirō knew this, effectively committing suicide as Fūma states Subaru's wish was dying at Seishirō's hands. After the battle, Fūma offers Subaru Seishirō's remaining intact eye, revealing that it was Seishirō's wish to erase Fūma's trace on Subaru, which Subaru accepts. This act completes this ritual and, after regaining his full sight, Subaru becomes the 14th Sakurazukamori {{and one of the}} Dragons of Earth. A sidestory in the series also shows Seishiro becoming the Sakurazukamori by killing his mother who tells him he will also be killed by the person he loves.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout her career, Edwards has {{advocated}} for explicit teaching—i.e. giving students, parents, and teachers the exact information and procedures needed for success [...] and not assuming that {{practices such as}} reading aloud and sharing time are mutually understood by teachers and families in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>She</b> has focused her efforts on increasing family literacy and involvement, helping others better understand and capitalize on African American and other minority students' literacy resources, understanding what literacy looks like internationally, and preparing literacy teachers to work with diverse students and families.|$|R
500|$|Music appears {{throughout}} Angelou's third autobiography, {{starting with}} the title, which evokes a blues song and references the beginnings of Angelou's career in music and performance. She starts Singin' and Swingin <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> starts Caged Bird: with an epigraph to set the tone. Here, the epigraph is a quotation from an unidentified three-line stanza in classic blues form. After the epigraph, [...] "music" [...] is the first word in the book. As the story opens, a lonely Angelou finds solace in Black music, and is soon hired as a salesgirl in a record store on Fillmore Street in San Francisco. She meets and {{falls in love with}} her first husband after she discovers their shared appreciation of Black music. After learning of her grandmother's death, her reaction, [...] "a dazzling passage three paragraphs long" [...] according to Mary Jane Lupton, is musical; not only does it rely upon gospel tradition, but is also influenced by African American literary texts, especially James Weldon Johnson's [...] "Go Down Death—A Funeral Sermon".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it speaks}} about a love {{stronger}} than a gunshot, {{and according to}} Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine it is a [...] "less violent version" [...] of Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "Man Down". Edmonton Journal Sandra Sperounes wrote that on [...] "No Love Allowed" [...] Rihanna plays with the Barbadian accent on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> did on her 2005 debut single [...] "Pon de Replay". According to a reviewer of Billboard, Rihanna's cry to the love police in the song, {{can be heard in}} the lines, [...] "Broken heart was the case / go'on and put him away / He's the only one one one / I let get the best of me." [...] BBC Music's Natalie Shaw wrote that some of the song's lyrics like [...] "Like a bullet your love hit me to the core / I was flying ‘til you knocked me to the floor", are uncomfortably balanced between true love and awkward acrimony. According to Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly, the up stated lines [...] "doesn’t sound like she has forgiven" [...] Chris Brown for the 2009 domestic violence case.|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} verse and chorus, the song {{features}} a break down influenced by house music. Gaga chants {{the lines in}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> does {{in the middle of}} [...] "Born This Way". Then she sings, [...] "I wanna love you/ But something's pulling me away from you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to." [...] In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of Rihanna's by Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone. He also added that her voice sounded less dark and dramatic and was full of [...] "bubbly sweetness". Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like tribal-techno, and the whole song was [...] "a turbo-charged electrogothic wrongness anthem". Dan Martin from NME wrote that the breakdown was in the dubstep genre with the chorus being [...] "pure-pop". There were some similarities and influences of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. [...] "I wanted [...] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before {{but in terms of the}} formula I wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," [...] she added. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of A–Fm7–Cm–B–Cm as its chord progression.|$|E
6000|$|But her own poetry, romance, {{and honest}} heart, all went <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>she</b> cried out--'I don't {{care what you}} have, not I. I've promised, and I'll be true--get along with you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} was," [...] replied Gregory; [...] "and although I {{delight in}} {{being among the}} ice, I sincerely hope that our tight little brig may not be tried in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> But <b>she</b> is better able to stand it, I should think." ...|$|R

2500|$|Each book in The Hunger Games trilogy {{has three}} {{sections}} of nine chapters each. Collins has said this format comes from her playwriting background, which {{taught her to}} write in a three-act structure; her previous series, The Underland Chronicles, was written in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> sees each group of nine chapters as a separate part of the story, and comments still call those divisions [...] "act breaks".|$|E
2500|$|Savchenko {{believes}} that [...] "after the war" [...] Ukraine should be become [...] "more {{or less a}} dictatorship" [...] with [...] a strong leader who can control the situation until it passes through to {{the next stage of}} development.” She sees former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet as one of her idols; claiming “Obviously, he was a dictator, but in an altruistic way. The country was much better after him than it was before him.” Savchenko claims she would rule Ukraine in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> also looks for inspiration to Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel, Ronald Reagan and Nelson Mandela.|$|E
2500|$|While Christina may {{not have}} been alone in her own time for {{choosing}} masculine dress (Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, for example, was known for dressing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way),</b> <b>she</b> also had physical features some described as masculine. According to Henry II, Duke of Guise, [...] "she wears men's shoes and her voice and nearly all her actions are masculine". When she arrived in Lyon, she again wore a toque and had styled her hair like that of a young man. It was noted that she also wore large amounts of powder and face cream. In one account she [...] "was sunburnt, and she looked like a sort of Egyptian street girl, very strange, and more alarming than attractive".|$|E
60|$|In {{all future}} conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly {{certain that the}} ride had made no difference, and {{that if she had}} stayed at home <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{symptoms}} would have come on and would have ended in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> because <b>she</b> had felt something like them before.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that <b>she</b> fell fast in {{love with}} Eastman, soon after she began seeing the author John Fox, Jr.. She told him she loved him but he didn't {{reciprocate}} right away. When he did tell her that he loved her, {{she was no longer}} interested.|$|R
60|$|She did {{as though}} she understood; the song rose into a cry, and stopped; the woman {{crouched}} out of <b>the</b> house <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that <b>she</b> came in, and must have plunged straight into the bush, for when I followed {{her to the door}} she had already vanished.|$|R
2500|$|When {{her book}} Thinking in Pictures {{was written in}} 1995, Grandin thought that all {{individuals}} with autism thought in photographic specific images the way she did. [...] When the expanded edition was published in 2006, she now realized {{that it had been}} wrong to assume that every person with autism processed information <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> did. [...] In this edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were: 1. Visual Thinkers like her who think in photographically specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers – these people think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers – These people think in word details and their favorite subject may be history.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't let us talk of that," [...] she said, {{soft and}} beseeching, just <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> used to speak {{when she was}} a baby-child and wanted to coax me into something. [...] "Let us talk about the old days--and HIM." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, she doesn't," [...] {{spoke up}} the Story Girl undauntedly.

50|$|In the end Aradhna {{achieves}} {{her goal}} (to get Shailendra out of Raveena's clutches), and Shailendra is sorry for his unacceptable actions.

5000|$|Redding {{identifies}} with both faiths [...] "100 percent," [...] explaining {{that this is}} possible in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that <b>she</b> can be both an African American and a woman.

She continues to worship in the Episcopal Church, {{as well as with}} Al-Islam Center of Seattle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bother it!" [...] she exclaimed, {{when the}} last of her hair pins had gone <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> having failed seven times to Dick's once.

60|$|In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> {{could not}} bring herself to think that Fanny was doing right, in {{following}} the bent of her dearest wishes--in marrying this man she loved so truly.

60|$|Summer was one {{continuous}} and busy play-spell {{for her in}} those days before her lessons became a serious thing, for as she sat in school she was experimenting in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> chewed paper into balls and snapped them like the boys. She carried slips of elm bark to chew also, and slate pencils she crunched daily. She gnawed {{the corners of her}} slate, tasted her ink and munched the cedar of her pencil.|$|E
50|$|She {{learned to}} take these {{difficulties}} in stride, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that <b>she</b> remained unfazed by the mistrust shown towards them by government troopers and New People’s Army (NPA) guerrillas both operating in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> area. “You don’t have to shout,” she once told an angry soldier, in a cool tone that distinguished her as a lady from a refined background.|$|R

6000|$|It {{must have}} been that she grew very sleepy--probably the heat weighed her eyelids down--certainly she found it {{impossible}} to keep her eyes open, and Maurice apparently thought that she felt faint.

[...] or [...] "Should he try and find Madame la Duchesse?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{those days}} Captain Clayton {{spent much of}} his time at Cong, and Frank Jones was often with him. Frank, however, had {{returned}} from London a much altered man. Rachel had knocked under to him. It was thus that he spoke of it to himself. I do not think that she spoke of it to herself exactly in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> knew her own constancy, and felt that she was to be rewarded.|$|E

Do you recollect that French maid of mine--the woman I sent away, because she would spit, when {{she was out of}} temper, like a cat? I begin to think I treated the poor creature harshly. When I hear of Romayne and his Retreat, I almost feel inclined to spit, myself. There! let us go on with your reading. Take the first volume--I have done with it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{advertisements}} {{of other}} people did not serve any better. There was always something wrong about the houses when we made close inquiries, and the trouble was generally {{in regard to the}} rent. With agents we had a little better fortune. Euphemia sometimes went with me on my expeditions to real estate offices, and she remarked that these offices were always in the basement, or else you had to go up to them in an elevator. There was nothing between these extremes. And it was a good deal <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> said, with their houses. They were all very low indeed in price and quality, or else too high.|$|E

6000|$|Lucilla stood up, but {{speech was}} impossible. She {{was in no}} mood to affect indifference, yet she could neither be angry nor magnanimous.
