The Trojans got an early lead with a Mario Danelo field goal {{and did not}} slow down, scoring on a Leinart touchdown pass {{and a pair of}} rushing touchdowns by LenDale White and Reggie Bush.

5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828.

5|$|The Trojans {{began the}} season by {{traveling}} to Hawaii {{to face the}} Warriors led by sixth–year head coach June Jones and quarterback Colt Brennan, Leinart's backup in high school.

The Warriors answered with a field goal, however the Trojans scored 14points {{in the second quarter}} to take a 21–3 lead into half-time.
