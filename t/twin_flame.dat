Although a dual ignition system is a method of achieving optimum combustion and better fuel consumption, it remains rare in cars and motorcycles because of difficulties in siting the second plug within the cylinder head. The Nash Ambassador for 1932-1948 used twin sparkplugs on the straight eight engine, while later Alfa Romeo Twin Spark cars use dual ignition, as do Honda cars with the i-DSI series engines, and Chrysler's Modern Hemi engine. In 1980 Nissan installed twin sparkplugs on the Nissan NAPS-Z engine, with Ford introducing it on the 1989 Ford Ranger and 1991 Ford Mustang four-cylinder models. Several modern Mercedes-Benz engines also have two spark plugs per cylinder, such as the M112 and M113 engines.

40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion {{in both the}} premixed and the non-premixed regime. Non-premixed hybrid bluff-body/swirl flames are simulated {{by means of a}} steady flamelet model (Flamelet-LES) based on detailed chemical kinetics. LES of lean premixed <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> stabilised on a turbulent opposed jet (TOJ) burner are carried out using an algebraic Flame Surface Density model (FSD-LES) and a newly developed model based on Linear Eddy Mixing (LEM-LES). Isothermal swirling flow at a medium Reynolds and swirl number is simulated first and the LES model is shown to accurately predict the velocity statistics and the complex flow field governed by vortex breakdown and two recirculation zones. The Flamelet- LES model is subsequently used to simulate a low speed swirling methane flame and the capability of the model to predict downstream recirculation, vortex breakdown and central jet precession in the presence of heat release is demonstrated. The simulation of two high speed hydrogen/methane swirl flames with the Flamelet-LES model shows that some quantitative predictions of this challenging test case for combustion simulation can be achieved, while the overall predictions are not satisfactory. The flamelet approach is found sensitive to minor errors in the mixing field which strongly affect the simulation results due to the highly non-linear mixture fraction/density relationship. Non-reacting simulations of turbulent opposed jet flows at moderate Reynolds number are performed and compared to experimental reference data. The inclusion of the flow field inside the nozzles into the computational domain is shown to yield accurate predictions of the velocity statistics between the nozzles. For these predictions the detailed knowledge of the initial jet development region near the turbulence generating plates is vital and provided by PIV measurements inside a glass nozzle. FSD-LES of the <b>twin</b> premixed TOJ <b>flames</b> show that the velocity statistics, both along the burner axis and the stagnation plane, can be predicted to high accuracy. However, the algebraic flame surface density model employed in the present study requires the adjustment of a model parameter and as a result, predictions of the turbulent burning velocity cannot be achieved. The comparison of two different interpretations of the FSD model show that a formulation using an additional diffusion term allows for a better resolution of the premixed flames in LES than the original formulation without diffusion. A complex LEM combustion model is first developed as a Stand-Alone approach to simulate premixed combustion and subsequently coupled to LES. The LEM-LES model requires a number of sub-models to represent the effects of sub-grid stirring, finite-rate chemistry, sub-grid expansion, 3 D convection (splicing) and flame propagation which are described in detail. The LEM-LES model is – to the author’s knowledge – the first attempt to simulate premixed flames with finite-rate chemistry in incompressible turbulent flow. Preliminary results from the application of LEM-LES to the premixed <b>twin</b> TOJ <b>flames</b> are reported and show a high sensitivity to the 3 D convection model and the requirement to improve the splicing procedure for premixed flames in anisotropic turbulent flow. The difficulty to accurately resolve the turbulent flow field by LES while simultaneously accommodating a premixed flame of finite thickness on the LEM sub-grid is found to be a challenge for the LEM-LES of premixed TOJ flames.

To change the stretch rate, the inflow velocity is varied from 0. 5 to 3. 5 m/s. The distance between two inflow boundaries is 15 mm. Based on the reaction rate, we have estimated the burning velocity at different stretch rates. Results show that the burning velocity is decreased with an increase of stretch rate.

5000|$|In the 1988 {{released}} The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and Twin Flames, Mark and Elizabeth Prophet {{describe the}} “one true love” or “origin” based <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> relationship that is oftentimes {{referred to as}} a soulmate relationship by saying “They are called twin flames because they came out of the original single ovoid. The Electronic Presence of each soul is the exact duplicate of the other. And when they descend into form, one assumes the positive or masculine and one assumes the negative or feminine polarity.” The Prophet’s ideas about the physical nature of a “true love” relationship are not completely inconsistent with the words and ideas expressed by ancient philosophers and in various religious traditions. The Greek philosopher Aristotle is quoted as saying [...] "Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies" [...] and the Zohar states that [...] "Each soul and spirit prior to its entering into this world, consists of a male and female united into one being. When it descends on this earth the two parts separate and animate two different bodies. At the time of marriage, the Holy One, blessed be He, who knows all souls and spirits, unites them again as they were before, and they again constitute one body and one soul, forming as it were the right and left of one individual." [...] In Hinduism, the gods Shiva and Parvati fit the “right and left of one individual” description given in the Judaism related Zohar when represented in their composite androgynous form Ardhanarishvara. It is said that Ardhanarishvara “represents a synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe“. In Christian literature, there is mention of an Ardhanarishvara like “two into one” union in the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew “the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh”. Additionally, in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus reportedly describes a “two into one”, yin and yang like or Ardhanarishvara like relationship to his disciples as the way to enter the Kingdom. [...] "Jesus said to them, [...] "When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female, when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you will enter kingdom.".

It was also found that under ultra-lean conditions the flame temperature of RCTF largely exceeds the adiabatic flame temperature; e. g., at Φ = 0. 06 the former is 1171 K, while the latter is 503 K. This increase of burned gas temperature is attributed to the so-called low Lewis number effect within the flammability limit, but under an ultra-lean condition some other mechanism to increase temperature is dominant. The “pseudo local equivalence ratio” of burned gas of RCTF differs largely from that of the unburned gas due to the extraordinarily high concentration of H 2 O. This suggests the possibility that the local condition at the reaction zone is much richer than the unburned gas, which brings about the large temperature increase...|$|R

Lean premixed flames were measured using PIV, and novel techniques used to extract unconditional velocity statistics, bulk motion and rotation effects, conditional statistics, turbulent burning velocities, flame surface density (FSD), thickness of turbulent flame brush and instantaneous reaction zone, flame surface area, conditional dissipation, as well as conditional POD (CPOD).

40|$|A multi-fluid state {{approach}} {{is used to}} analyse the underlying conditions for burning mode transitions from close to the corrugated flamelet regime to distributed reactions. Turbulent (Ret ≃ 380) premixed DME/air flames were aerodynamically stabilised in a back-to-burnt opposed jet configuration with the Damköhler number varied through the mixture stoichiometry. Simultaneous Mie scattering, OH-PLIF and PIV allowed the delineation of five separate fluid states (reactants, combustion products, mixing fluid, mildly and strongly reacting fluids) with associated material surfaces. The analysis shows self-sustained flames in low strain regions with a collocated flow acceleration for higher Damköhler numbers. By contrast, in highly strained regions (e. g. beyond the <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> extinction point) the burning mode is governed by the counter-flowing hot combustion products resulting in increased levels of vorticity and an absence of a preferential dilatation direction. The current analysis provides novel insights into combustion regime transitions by means of (i) strain rate statistics conditioned upon material surfaces and (ii) the evolution of fluid state interface probabilities {{as a function of}} the Damköhler number.

40|$|The {{flammability}} of alternative, non-ozone depleting refrigerants is {{an issue}} of growing importance to the air-conditioning and refrigeration industry. Test methods developed decades ago are being stretched to their limits when measuring the combustion behavior of weakly flammable refrigerants. This work is Phase 2 of a three part project to determine the feasibility, accuracy, and applicability of a premixed opposed-flow burner as an alternative means of measuring lean flammability limits. In this work, the Phase 2 burner demonstrates the precision available to the opposed-flow technique for evaluating the lean flammability limit of weak fuels. Using opposed, converging nozzles, two jets support a premixed <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> at different global strain rates and permit evaluation of the corresponding fuel concentration at the extinction point. Comparisons with published data support that the LFL{sub 0 }, a lean flammability limit value defined by the extrapolation of the extinction conditions to zero global strain, yields a consistent value.

40|$|The flame {{extinction}} limits of syngas (H{sub 2 }-CO) flames were measured using a twin-flame-counter-flow burner. Plots of Extinction limits vs. global stretch rates were generated at different mixture compositions and an extrapolation method {{was used to}} calculate the {{flame extinction}} limit corresponding to an experimentally unattainable zero-stretch condition. The zero-stretch extinction limit of H{sub 2 }-CO mixtures decreases (from rich to lean) with the increase in H{sub 2 } concentration in the mixture. The average difference between the measured flame extinction limit and the Le Chatelier's calculation is around {approx} 7 %. The measured OH{sup -} chemiluminescent data indicates that regardless of mixture compositions the OH radical concentration reduces (within the experimental uncertainties) to an extinction value prior to the flame extinction. Flame extinction limits of H{sub 2 }-CO mixtures measured in a flat-flame burner configuration also show a similar relation. Additionally, the measured laminar flame velocity close to the extinction indicates that regardless of fuel composition the premixed flame of hydrogen fuel blends extinguishes when the mixture laminar flame velocity falls below a critical value. The critical laminar flame velocity at extinction for H{sub 2 }-CO premixed flames (measured in the flat flame burner configuration) is found to be 3. 77 ({+-} 0. 38) cm/s. An externally perturbed H{sub 2 }-CO <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> was not experimentally achievable for the mixture conditions used in the present investigation. A slightest perturbation in the flow-field distorts the H{sub 2 }-CO twin-flame. The flame becomes highly unstable with the introduction of an externally excited flow oscillation...|$|E
