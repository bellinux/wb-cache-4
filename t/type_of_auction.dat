25|$|Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> has its {{specific}} qualities such as pricing accuracy and {{time required for}} preparing and conducting the auction. The number of simultaneous bidders is of critical importance. Open bidding during {{an extended period of}} time with many bidders will result in a final bid that is very close to the true market value. Where there are few bidders and each bidder is allowed only one bid, time is saved, but the winning bid may not reflect the true market value with any degree of accuracy. Of special interest and importance during the actual auction is the time elapsed from the moment that the first bid is revealed to the moment that the final (winning) bid has become a binding agreement.|$|E
25|$|English auction, {{also known}} as an open {{ascending}} price auction. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> {{is arguably the most}} common form of auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In some cases a maximum bid might be left with the auctioneer, who may bid on behalf of the bidder according to the bidder's instructions. The auction ends when no participant is willing to bid further, at which point the highest bidder pays their bid. Alternatively, if the seller has set a minimum sale price in advance (the 'reserve' price) and the final bid does not reach that price the item remains unsold. Sometimes the auctioneer sets a minimum amount by which the next bid must exceed the current highest bid. The most significant distinguishing factor of this auction type is that the current highest bid is always available to potential bidders. The English auction is commonly used for selling goods, most prominently antiques and artwork, but also secondhand goods and real estate.|$|E

2500|$|... or blind auction, {{also known}} as a first-price sealed-bid auction (FPSB). In this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> all bidders {{simultaneously}} submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. The highest bidder pays the price they submitted. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> is distinct from the English auction, in that bidders can only submit one bid each. Furthermore, as bidders cannot see the bids of other participants they cannot adjust their own bids accordingly. From the theoretical perspective, this kind of bid process has been argued to be strategically equivalent to the Dutch auction. However, empirical evidence from laboratory experiments has shown that Dutch auctions with high clock speeds yield lower prices than FPSB auctions. What are effectively sealed first-price auctions are commonly called tendering for procurement by companies and organisations, particularly for government contracts and auctions for mining leases.|$|E
2500|$|... is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> where bidders bid for boxes or {{envelopes}} containing unspecified or underspecified items, {{usually on}} {{the hope that}} the items will be humorous, interesting, or valuable.

40|$|This paper investigates {{implications}} {{of some of}} the well established behavioral biases to the behavior of bidders and sellers in different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>auctions.</b> The experimental study presented in the paper shows that: (1) sellers in all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>auctions</b> are subject to the endowment effect; (2) bidders in English auctions are also subject to the endowment effect and tend to bid more than in second price sealed bid auctions; and (3) bidders in all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>auctions</b> are subject to the anchoring effect. We also test the Engelbrecht-Wiggans (1989) hypothesis that winners of first-price sealed bid auctions can regret “money left on the table”, but find no evidence in its support...|$|R

2500|$|Reverse auction is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> {{in which}} {{the roles of the}} buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the best price among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. By revealing the competing bids in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a variant}} of the English auction in which bids are written on a sheet of paper. At the {{predetermined}} end of the auction, the highest listed bidder wins the item. This auction is often used in charity events, with many items auctioned simultaneously and [...] "closed" [...] at a common finish time. The auction is [...] "silent" [...] in that there is no auctioneer selling individual items, the bidders writing their bids on a bidding sheet often left on a table near the item. At charity auctions, bid sheets usually have a fixed starting amount, predetermined bid increments, and a [...] "guaranteed bid" [...] amount which works the same as a [...] "buy now" [...] amount. Other variations of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> may include sealed bids. The highest bidder pays the price he or she submitted.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some parts}} of England during {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries auction by candle began to be used for the sale of goods and leaseholds. In a candle auction, the end of the auction was {{signaled}} by the expiration of a candle flame, which was intended to ensure that no one could know exactly when the auction would end and make a last-second bid. Sometimes, other unpredictable processes, such as a footrace, were used in place of the expiration of a candle. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auction</b> was first mentioned in 1641 in the records of the House of Lords. The practice rapidly became popular, and in 1660 Samuel Pepys's diary recorded two occasions when the Admiralty sold surplus ships [...] "by an inch of candle". Pepys also relates a hint from a highly successful bidder, who had observed that, just before expiring, a candle-wick always flares up slightly: on seeing this, he would shout his final - and winning - bid. The London Gazette began reporting on the auctioning of artwork at the coffeehouses and taverns of London in the late 17th century.|$|E

40|$|Deregulation {{changed the}} {{electrical}} industry {{from being a}} regulated priced structure to a market based pricing one. The deregulation of the market brought with it the concept <b>of</b> <b>auctions</b> and the word auction entered the electrical engineers dictionary for the first time. An auction {{can be defined as}} a game of incomplete instructions for determining the cost of a product that has no standard value. It is an institution with explicit rules for pricing and resource allocations based on the bids of the participant's. An <b>auction</b> essentially consists <b>of</b> four parts-players, objects, pay-off functions and strategies. Players, either sophisticated or rational, are the market participants who bid for the commodity (object) that is being auctioned. The pay-off functions are the various pricing mechanisms, costs for preparation, participation, reservation and information. The underlying idea in an auction is the maximization of the profits by the players and several strategies are employed to achieve that goal. The players' knowledge of the price of the commodity and the method of procuring the object in an auction give rise to myriad <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>auctions.</b> This paper deals with the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>auctions</b> and their bidding strategies in the deregulated electric power industry. ...|$|R

Auctions have been mostly studied from a game-theoretic and economic perspective, although recent work in AI and OR has been concerned with computational aspects <b>of</b> <b>auctions</b> as well. When faced from a computational perspective, combinatorial auctions are perhaps the most challenging <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>auctions.</b> Combinatorial auctions are auctions where agents may submit bids for bundles of goods. Given that finding an optimal allocation of the goods in a combinatorial auction is in general intractable, researchers have been concerned with exposing tractable instances <b>of</b> combinatorial <b>auctions.</b> In this work we expose the use of b-matching techniques in the context <b>of</b> combinatorial <b>auctions,</b> and apply them in a non-trivial manner in order to introduce polynomial solutions for a variety <b>of</b> combinatorial <b>auctions...</b>|$|R
