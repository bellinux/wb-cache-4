5|$|The BT46 {{appeared}} for {{the last}} time in the Formula One World Championship at {{the first round of the}} 1979 season in the hands of Nelson Piquet. Niki Lauda also used the car to qualify for that race, as the new BT48 was proving troublesome, although he did race <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car.</b> Piquet retired on the first lap after a multi-car collision that wrecked the BT46.|$|E
5|$|Flexible fuel {{vehicles}} were 22% of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> sales in 2004, 73% in 2005, 87.6% in July 2008, and reached a record 94% in August 2009. The production of flex-fuel cars and light commercial vehicles since 2003 reached 10million vehicles in March 2010, and 15million in January 2012. Registrations of flex-fuel cars {{and light trucks}} represented 87.0% of all passenger and light duty vehicles sold in the country in 2012. Production passed the 20million-unit mark in June 2013. By the end of 2014, flex-fuel cars represented 54% of the Brazilian registered stock of light-duty vehicles, while gasoline only vehicles represented 34.3%. , flex-fuel light-duty vehicle sales totaled 25.5million units.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{plans to}} enhance the station's {{facilities}} were approved by the Department for Transport. The works, {{part of a large}} transport scheme called the Weston Package, included expanded the car park by 320 spaces, better facilities for cyclists and motorcyclists, and a bus interchange. A bus link to the nearby Queensway retail park was also included in the scheme. The expansion took over unused land to the east and south of the station, and required the removal of slowworms and grass snakes to a nature reserve in Cheddar. The work, which started in April 2013, was completed later the same year with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> park opening on 3 September 2013.|$|E

5|$|Motor Racing Developments {{initially}} {{concentrated on}} making money by building cars {{for sale to}} customers in lower formulae, so <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> for the Formula One team was not ready until partway through the 1962 Formula One season. The Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) started the year fielding a customer Lotus chassis, which was delivered at 3:00 am {{in order to keep}} it a secret. Brabham took two points finishes in Lotuses, before the turquoise-liveried Brabham BT3 car made its debut at the 1962 German Grand Prix. It retired with a throttle problem after 9 of the 15 laps, but went on to take a pair of fourth places {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Also, Norway was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to have all-electric cars topping <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> sales monthly ranking. The Tesla Model S has been the top selling new car four times, and the Nissan Leaf has topped the monthly new car sales ranking twice. In March 2014 the Tesla Model S also broke the 28-year-old record for monthly sales of a single model {{regardless}} of its power source, surpassing the previous record set in May 1986. In July 2016, when new car registrations are break down by type of powertrain, {{for the first time a}} plug-in hybrid, the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, listed as the top selling new car. In September 2016, the Tesla Model X ranked as the top selling new car model in Norway when registrations are broken down by type of powetrain. The BMW i3 was the top selling new car model in the country in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Forti {{produced}} a new chassis, the FG03, {{for the next}} race {{of the season in}} Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E

5|$|Once the 1976 Formula One World Championship season {{got under}} way Pryce {{instantly}} added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in Brazil. This came {{at the expense of}} continuing team mate Jarier, who was caught out by oil on the track from James Hunt's McLaren. Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at Kyalami and Long Beach. Changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had to lower their airboxes and mount the cars' rear wings further forward, along with revised Goodyear tyres, meant the Shadow DN5B lost much of its competitiveness; Pryce still achieved a second points scoring finish of the season in Britain. The new Shadow DN8 was not introduced until the twelfth round at Zandvoort, where Pryce qualified <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it was the last points scoring finish of his career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.|$|E
25|$|On 3 June 2015 it was {{revealed}} that development of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> had been underway {{for more than a year}} with partners Gordon Murray and Cosworth that would be launched in 2017 followed by additional models as part of a 10-year plan. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> boasts an impressive specification, front engined, rear wheel drive, normally aspirated Cosworth V8 mated to a manual transmission that caused it to be described as “God’s own sports car”. Codenamed T37, deposits were taken in anticipation for delivery in 2017.|$|E

Even {{thought they}} were <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>cars,</b> they had a variety of problems. The R46s broke down the most and had cracked trucks, while the R44s had issues because of the {{sophisticated}} technology that was installed in anticipation of operating on a fully automated IND Second Avenue Line.|$|R
25|$|Independent rear {{suspension}} (designed by Cadillac engineers) was adopted for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car,</b> which helped to increase usable rear-seat and trunk {{space in the}} smaller body, as well as improved handling over previous Toronados with no sacrifice in ride quality.

2500|$|Before Hurricane Katrina, the {{historic}} cars ran {{exclusively on the}} St. Charles Avenue Line, and <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>cars</b> on <b>the</b> other two lines. However, {{in the wake of}} hurricane damage to the St. Charles line tracks and overhead wires, and to almost all of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> red <b>cars,</b> <b>the</b> older cars were run on Canal Street and Riverfront until <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>cars</b> could be repaired. [...] Using whatever worked wherever it could be run continued for several years.

[...] The P3 had almost no boot at all yet that had been considered rather more than adequate. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>car's</b> bonnet-like extension to its rear was ridiculed, the driver sat well forward looking out over a relatively short bonnet and the rear wheels were set well back behind the back seat. All <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car's</b> proportions were different from all <b>the</b> other <b>new</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R

25|$|Development for the third-generation Taurus {{began in}} 1991, and its {{designers}} and engineers {{believed that they}} were faced with a daunting task; they compared completely redesigning the Taurus to repainting the Mona Lisa.

Again in 2015, with 215,525 units sold, down 7.6% from 2014, the Aqua ranked as <b>the</b> top-selling <b>new</b> <b>car</b> in Japan. <b>The</b> Toyota Aqua not only was <b>the</b> best-selling <b>new</b> <b>car</b> in Japan for three years running, from 2013 to 2015, but it is considered the most successful nameplate launch in the Japanese market of the last 20 years. In the first quarter of 2016, the Prius liftback surpassed the Aqua as <b>the</b> best-selling <b>new</b> <b>car,</b> <b>the</b> Prius ended 2016 as the best-selling standard car in the Japanese market with 248,258 units, followed by the Aqua with 168,208 units.|$|R
25|$|The second {{generation}} RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still {{known as the}} Mazda Savanna RX-7 in Japan, featured a complete restyling reminiscent of the Porsche 924. Mazda's stylists, led by Chief Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama, focused on the Porsche 924 for their inspiration in designing the FC because <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>car</b> was being styled primarily for the American market, {{where the majority of}} first generation RX-7s had been sold.|$|E
