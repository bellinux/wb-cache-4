5|$|Boise State {{came into}} the game {{averaging}} 42.75points and 475.67yards per game, the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football. Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3,000yards and 28 touchdowns, headed into the 2007 Hawaii Bowl. On the ground, the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson, who had 17touchdowns and 1,030yards in the regular season. Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was a potent threat on offense, averaging 87.08receiving yards per game, and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41.44yards per game on average. Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All-WAC honors, and Tharp was named to Second Team All-WAC. Offensive tackle Ryan Clady was the team's only All-American, and promised <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job protecting Taylor Tharp on the offensive line.|$|E
25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so much}} about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job.|$|E

Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly {{do not feel that}} I can accept this award... I can accept it only as {{it was meant to be}} for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E
500|$|As filming for the 1964 season approached, fourteen-year-old Jon Provost {{chose not}} renew his contract. Stars Lockhart and Reilly were fired. [...] With only Provost and the {{producers}} knowing {{the real reason}} for the changes, the press was told the show had done all the [...] "boy and his dog" [...] stories possible, but Lockhart speculated that Provost's mother wanted too much money. and Reilly later stated that the producers' decision was based upon trading four advanced salaries for future star Robert Bray's starting salary. Lockhart loved her role as [...] "Lassie's mother", but accepted her fate, telling columnist Bob Thomas: It was an actor's dream -- steady work, excellent pay, a wonderful cast and crew, and a chance <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> scene now and then...Now I'm ready to go back playing all those tramps and neurotic and alcoholic women.

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for each day's filming, she had the Trill spots applied by makeup artist Mary Kay Morse, with Michael Westmore working on her detailing instead. This was a change from when Farrell had portrayed Jadzia, as in that case, Westmore had applied the spots himself each day. She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, [...] "Image in the Sand", for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. [...] "I came in and I had one line — that's it, I hadn't even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn't found a place to live." [...] She began {{to understand what was}} required of her from her second episode onwards. She later explained that [...] "I never really got too freaked in the beginning. I thought more of this as the biggest job I've ever had, than going into the whole Star Trek phenomenon. I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job." ...|$|E
500|$|The Blackstone was {{managed by}} Harry J. Powers, a Chicago {{businessman}} with {{extensive experience in}} the theatre: [...] he had {{worked his way up}} from his early days as an usher to ultimately become one of Mr. Erlanger's most trusted associated; Powers remained as the Blackstone's manager throughout its first two decades. [...] The Blackstone's first productions featured some of that era's best known performers and playwrights—for example, after [...] "U.S. Minister Bedloe" [...] came a David Belasco production, [...] "The Return of Peter Grimm", starring David Warfield. [...] Many of the productions had already been well received in New York before coming to the Blackstone, such as another play that featured comic actor William H. Crane, [...] "The Senator Keeps House." [...] But while some of these productions were the equal of the version that played in New York, Tribune theatre critic Hammond observed on several occasions that the Chicago companies lacked the biggest stars. Despite this, the touring companies that performed at the Blackstone tended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job and Hammond praised them for their [...] "effective" [...] productions. This trend of presenting touring company versions would continue in later years, when most of the performances at the Blackstone were plays which had already won the Pulitzer Prize or the Tony Award, and were presented by touring companies from New York.|$|E
500|$|Boyd is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, {{and has been}} used on the left-wing throughout {{the majority of his}} career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play [...] "in the hole" [...] because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to [...] "play anywhere" [...] to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said [...] "I have played {{on both sides of the}} park and will always try my best <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job regardless of where the manager plays me". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a [...] "free-role", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said [...] "if we can get him free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he [...] "is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3–4–1–2 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first half of Stevenage's 2006–07 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's teammate at Burnley, said of Boyd: [...] "He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine".|$|E

500|$|Before any {{director}} {{was attached to}} Hard Target, Universal Pictures saw the film as a potential vehicle for actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme had already been {{a huge fan of}} Woo's films and arranged to meet with him in Hong Kong where the two got along despite both Woo and Van Damme's difficulty with their English. Woo originally wanted actor Kurt Russell for the lead role, but found Russell to be booked for two years with other film projects. On working with Van Damme, Woo stated that he was [...] "sure of [...] abilities and I know how to make an actor look good on screen, make him look like a hero. I thought I could do the same for Van Damme". Despite early misgivings of working with Van Damme, Woo changed many action scenes in the film to make them more spectacular on finding that Van Damme was up for it. While working with Van Damme, Woo stated that Van Damme had [...] "a pretty big ego, but he's still professional and always tries <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job." [...] Woo had some control over the film's casting including casting minor characters and finding a cinematographer. Actress Yancy Butler was cast as Natasha Binder in her feature film debut. The role led Butler to other starring roles in action films such as Drop Zone [...] and Fast Money. Actor Lance Henriksen accepted the role of Emil Fouchon stating he was a great fan of Woo, noting that his earlier films [...] "were so creative, so balletic, and had this incredible philosophy in them. The violence was only a container for the philosophy".|$|E
2500|$|After the Ward Churchill controversy, a {{telephone}} survey of “a thousand Americans aged 18 and older” by the American Association of University Professors found that, while “generally {{supportive of the}} tenure system”, [...] "only about 17.9 percent of respondents say the tenure system should remain as it is".

2500|$|It {{used to be}} {{difficult}} to maintain a wood floor properly. However, if the directions of the floor manufacturer are followed properly modern treatments will maintain a good surface. It is important not to just trust a commercial office cleaner to know how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job, they should be instructed to follow the directions. There are no cheap and foolproof machines around for measuring traction which would enable cleaners to see their work conforms to dance or sports requirements. [...] Thus there is a very strong inclination for managers or cleaners to go for other requirements e.g. a shiny surface or one that resists dirt better.|$|E
5000|$|At the University of Nevada, Fales redshirted his {{freshman}} year in 2009, behind starter and future NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

2500|$|The {{decision}} was also criticized {{because of the}} popular stereotype that female opera singers have to be heavy anyway, in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job. There is the old expression that [...] "in opera, great voices often come in large packages". and the well-worn saying about opera that [...] "It ain't over till the fat lady sings". She was headlined in the British tabloid press as [...] "The show ain't over till the fat lady slims." [...] There was also an outcry because, it seemed at the time, that high culture performing arts, such as opera, should not emulate low culture Hollywood images of thin female stars.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{homeless}} shelters across Tennessee received massive numbers of vegetarian pizzas from {{people all over}} the country honoring Workman's last meal request.

[...] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) President Ingrid Newkirk, who donated 15 veggie pizzas, commented that [...] "Workman's act was selfless, and kindness to all living beings is a virtue." [...] Marvin Champion, an employee of Nashville's Rescue Mission, remarked [...] "I used to be homeless, so I know how rough it gets. I seen some bad times – not having enough food, the cupboards are bare. But we got pizza to feed enough people for a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the return}} of Kat's father Charlie, Wallace said that this will provide a [...] "big boost" [...] to her character. Talking to We Love Telly, asked whether it's {{important}} for Kat to see Charlie again, Wallace replied: [...] "Yes, definitely. With what happened the night they thought Tommy died, things were still unresolved for them. Although they cleared the air before he left, things weren't right between them, so to have him back with her now {{makes it all the}} more special. It's also Charlie that makes Kat realise that she needs to bond with Tommy. He makes her see that she can do this." [...] Discussing what type of mother Kat will be, Wallace added: [...] "I think she wants to be the best mum possible. She knows that this is her second chance to make a go of it and she is determined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Public Law 689 {{authorized}} {{the creation of}} the WR, it also prohibited its members from serving outside the continental United States. This impediment changed on 27September 1944, when Public Law 441 amended 689 to allow WR members to serve in the Territory of Hawaii. Some thought the enactment of Public Law 441 was anticlimactic. Director Streeter believed that sending WR members to Hawaii [...] "was not worth all the trouble and cost". Nevertheless, the Marine Corps did deploy women to Hawaii. Hawaiian duty was on a volunteer basis. Many members applied, but only the very best of them were accepted. The requirements were stringent, inasmuch as the members had to have been on active duty for at least six months; commit to an 18-month tour; have a clean record; be in excellent mental and physical health; agree not to request leave to visit the mainland, and verify they had no dependents whose care might necessitate a trip back to the states. In addition, members were expected to have a stable personality, sufficient skill to fill one of the billets for which women had been requested, and motivation <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job. San Diego, California, became the staging area, where a short yet intense physical conditioning course was given. The first contingent of women arrived in Hawaii on 28January 1945. At mid-year, there were about 1,000 women serving in Hawaii. By January 1946, they were all back in the states.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} 13 years, the Peter Jones {{business}} was not profitable – no dividends were paid to Lewis and the external shareholders [...] and in desperation, in 1914 Lewis appointed his son Spedan {{as chairman of}} Peter Jones. This gave Spedan Lewis complete control, and he decided that the underlying {{problem was that the}} staff had no incentive <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> day's work, because their own interests were not in line with those of the business. He shortened their working day and instituted a system of commission for each department, paying selling staff amounts based on turnover. He held regular meetings at which staff could air any grievances directly with him. [...] In 1916, after a disagreement with his father, Spedan Lewis exchanged his 25 per cent interest in the Oxford Street business for Lewis's shares in Peter Jones Limited. He made improvements in staff conditions, including granting a third week's paid holiday each year. He had hot and cold running water installed in the staff bedrooms over the shop. In 1918, he started publishing a fortnightly newspaper telling staff how the business was faring. In 1919, he instituted a staff council, the first decision of which was that staff should be paid weekly instead of four-weekly. Business prospered: there was a profit of £20,000 in 1920. Spedan Lewis's radical idea was that the profits generated by business should not be paid solely to shareholders as a reward for their capital. Shareholders should receive a reasonable but limited return, and labour should be the recipient of the excess. His concept of 'fairer shares' involved sharing gain, knowledge and power. In 1920, Spedan started distributing Peter Jones preference shares to staff, who were now called 'Partners'.|$|E
