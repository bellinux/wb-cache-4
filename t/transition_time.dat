500|$|Until the {{authorization}} of the Montana class all US battleships were built within the size limits for the Panama Canal. The {{main reason for}} this was logistical: the largest US shipyards were located on the East Coast of the United States, while the United States had territorial interests in both oceans. Requiring the battleships to fit within the Panama Canal took days off the <b>transition</b> <b>time</b> from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean by allowing ships {{to move through the}} canal instead of sailing around South America. By the time of the Two Ocean Navy bill, the Navy realized that ship designs could no longer be limited by the extant Panama Canal and thus approved the Montana class while simultaneously planning for a new third set of locks that were [...] wide. This shift in policy meant that the Montana class would have been the only World War II–era US battleships to be adequately armored against guns of the same power as their own.|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} {{between the first and}} the last Ironman for swimming, cycling, running and overall race time was 43  s, 2  min, 2  min, and 12  min, respectively. Expressed in percent, the differences were 1.24 %, 0.56 %, 0.72 %, and 1.56 %, respectively. Swimming, cycling and overall race time was slower on Day 33, but running was faster on Day 33. Comparing the percent changes with athletes competing in a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon (Herbst et al. 2011), the changes were 18.5 [*]±[*] 19.5 %, 27.0 [*]±[*] 29.0 %, 22.5 [*]±[*] 32.0 %, and 24.0 [*]±[*] 21.0 %, respectively, where athletes became slower in both the split disciplines and overall race times. An interesting finding was that the CV for split times in swimming, cycling, running and overall race times were very low (i.e. 2.7 %, 3.2 %, 4.7 %, and 2.7 %, respectively) whereas the CV for <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> 1 and 2 were considerably higher (i.e. 25.5 % and 55.5 %, respectively). Most probably the athlete focussed more on the performance in the split disciplines than on the <b>transition</b> <b>times.</b> Otherwise, he may have used the <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> for eating and drinking. However, the aspect of <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> in Ironman triathlons needs further investigation. Reducing the <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> might improve overall race time.|$|R

500|$|As {{the young}} koala {{approaches}} six months, the mother begins to prepare it for its eucalyptus diet by predigesting the leaves, producing a faecal pap that the joey eats from her cloacum. The pap {{is quite different}} in composition from regular faeces, resembling instead {{the contents of the}} caecum, which has a high concentration of bacteria. Eaten for about a month, the pap provides a supplementary source of protein at a <b>transition</b> <b>time</b> from a milk to a leaf diet. The joey fully emerges from the pouch {{for the first time at}} six or seven months of age, when it weighs [...] It explores its new surroundings cautiously, clinging to its mother for support. By nine months, it weighs over [...] and develops its adult fur colour. Having permanently left the pouch, it rides on its mother's back for transportation, learning to climb by grasping branches. Gradually, it spends more time away from its mother, and at 12 months it is fully weaned, weighing around [...] When the mother becomes pregnant again, her bond with her previous offspring is permanently severed.

40|$|When {{modeling}} rating transitions as {{a continuous}} time Markov process, {{it is crucial to}} monitor the solvency of the debtors in small periodic intervals, in order to obtain suitable data for parameter estimation. If this is not done, the <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> are captured with an irregular delay, which leads to measurement errors in the <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> and consequently to biased parameter estimators. We develop a score test to check for such measurement errors in the transition data and prove the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. The test is applied to a dataset of an international corporate portfolio of a large German bank, while accounting for economic and debtor-specific covariates. The test result is positive, indicating that measurement errors in the <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> are a real problem in practice...|$|R

If {{it is to be}} useful, the instrument ought to be more versadle than the device it tests, and that is no simple matter when the devices' performance approaches the state of the art. In response to the need for instruments capable of testing high-speed logic circuits such as ECL and Schottky-TTl, we started on the design of a pulse generator that would generate S-volt pulses at {{repetition rate}}s up to 25 O MHz. Most importantly, this instrument would have pulse <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> variable down to less than 1 ns. Very fast transitions are needed for testing high-speed circuits but transitions that are too fast can cause problems of their own because they may become coupled into adjacent circuits. Variable <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> therefore were Gonsidered necessary for this instrument so designers could match pulse <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> to those found in their circuits. Developing circuits that would make <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> controllable down to L ns without causing excessive ringing or overshoot {{turned out to be the}} most challenging part of the project.

40|$|This paper studies an infinite-server queue in a semi-Markov environment: the queue’s {{input rate}} is {{modulated}} by a semi-Markovian background process, {{and the service}} times {{are assumed to be}} exponentially distributed. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} propose approximations for the queue-length distribution, based on time-scaling arguments. The analysis starts with an explicit analysis of the cases in which the <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> of the modulating semi-Markov process are either all deterministic or all exponential. We use these results to obtain approximations under time-scalings; there we consider subsequently a quasi-stationary regime (in which time is slowed down) and fluid-scaling regime (in which time is sped up) are examined. Notably, in the latter regime, the limiting distribution of the number of customers present is Poisson, irrespective of the distribution of the <b>transition</b> <b>times.</b> The accuracy of the resulting approximations is illustrated by several numerical experiments, that moreover give an indication of the speed of convergence in the both regimes, for various distributions of the <b>transition</b> <b>times.</b> The last section derives conditions under which the distribution of the number of customers present is Poisson (in the exact sense, i. e., not in a limiting regime) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to observe}} and {{recognize}} <b>transition</b> <b>times,</b> when human activities change. No generic method has been proposed for extracting <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> {{at different levels of}} activity granularity. Existing work in human behavior analysis and activity recognition has mainly used predefined sliding windows or fixed segments, either at low-level, such as standing or walking, or high-level, such as dining or commuting to work. We present an Information Gain-based Temporal Segmentation method (IGTS), an unsupervised segmentation technique, to find the <b>transition</b> <b>times</b> in human activities and daily routines, from heterogeneous sensor data. The proposed IGTS method is applicable for low-level activities, where each segment captures a single activity, such as walking, {{that is going to be}} recognized or predicted, and also for high-level activities. The heterogeneity of sensor data is dealt with a data transformation stage. The generic method has been thoroughly evaluated on a variety of labeled and unlabeled activity recognition and routine datasets from smartphones and device-free infrastructures. The experiment results demonstrate the robustness of the method, as all segments of low- and high-level activities can be captured from different datasets with minimum error and high computational efficiency...|$|R
