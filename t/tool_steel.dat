5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys.

When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. <b>Tool</b> <b>steel</b> is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E

It was found on the tribolayers of the AlCrN coated <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> that microcracking and oxides containing Fe and Cr to increase friction coefficient were formed at the early stage of sliding wear, followed by the generation of the smeared oxide layers containing Fe transferred from the tribopair to decrease friction coefficient.

Welding technologies are frequently applied to repair polymer injection moulds, namely due to changes in design and alterations due to use.

2500|$|Due to {{wear and}} tear of the MEU(SOC) pistols and {{increasing}} numbers of Marine personnel in Marine Force Recon and MARSOC, the U.S. Marines are looking commercially for replacements.

[...] This is the same pistol used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation SWAT and Hostage Rescue Teams; however, it had previously been rejected for adoption as the ICQB. Despite the planned purchase of the commercial pistols, Marine Corps Systems Command has continued to solicit parts to build additional MEU(SOC) pistols. In 2010, requirements were once more issued for an off-the-shelf system to replace the custom-built pistols. Three pistols were offered to the USMC as a replacement for current M45 Pistols. Colt offered a modified version of their O1980RG (Rail Gun) pistol, which is derived from their existing XSE line of 1911-style pistols with a desert sand-colored surface treatment and Novak night sights. Springfield Armory entered a variant of the full-sized Loaded MC Operator M1911A1 pistol with a military-standard 1913 rail, tritium night sights and finished with a two-tone black slide with an olive-drab green frame.
