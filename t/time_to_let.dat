Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.|$|E
500|$|After {{the large}} {{success of the}} demo version, Yankovic wanted to put the song {{on one of his}} albums. However, the immensely complex process of getting {{permission}} from George Lucas and the publishers of the Kinks' [...] "Lola" [...] delayed the release of the song for about five years. Eventually, after Lucas gave Yankovic permission, the song's publishers turned Al down. [...] Several versions of why the parody was turned down exist. In a 1985 interview with Spin, Yankovic explained that, [...] "We approached Ray Davies , we've been approaching him every year and a half, two years before each album comes out and he's always been a little skeptical, a little afraid because 'Lola' was a very personal song for him. Then just out of the blue he decided this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> us do it." [...] However, the liner notes to the [...] present a different story. According to the album's notes, the song may have remained unreleased for some time {{had it not been for}} a chance encounter Yankovic had with the song's original songwriter, Ray Davies. When Yankovic asked why he hadn't given him permission, Davies remarked that he had never been asked. Davies immediately gave Yankovic permission to record the song, and the song was later released on Dare to Be Stupid.|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

2500|$|In Discipline and Punish, the French philosopher Michel Foucault cites {{this case}} of Damiens the Regicide {{as an example}} of disproportionate {{punishment}} in the era preceding the [...] "Age of Reason".

2500|$|GLaDOS {{was written}} {{with the intent}} of making her more {{understandable}} and empathetic to players, making her villainy more tragic. Kim Swift, team leader of Portal, described her growth in the game as her becoming more and more human. The two-hour total playtime for Portal allowed the writers enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> players get to know GLaDOS. Wolpaw commented that while GLaDOS did yell and fire rockets at the player, she fulfilled his desire for a villain who has not been [...] "done to death". He described her as both supportive and funny, while also sad and scared. One of his intentions was for players to believe that they are [...] "putting her through the wringer emotionally". The game was designed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Wolpaw stated that with each new part, GLaDOS' personality changed. She begins as a supportive, yet also increasingly sinister character, where she delivers exposition about the general Aperture mindset. However, once the player-character escapes, she begins to speak in first-person singular rather than first-person plural. She shows desperation due to her lack of control at this point, adding that more emotion begins to creep through her voice. After destroying the morality core, she becomes unhinged, featuring an almost human voice. This voice, described as sultry by Wolpaw, was originally to be used for turrets, but it did not work out. Because they liked it so much, they chose to use it for GLaDOS. Valve described GLaDOS' actions in Portal 2 as attempting to build a relationship with the player-character, {{and the only way to}} accomplish this is by testing her.|$|E
