60|$|Let us now suppose {{this mass}} so far {{condensed}} that it occupies precisely the space circumscribed by {{the orbit of}} Neptune, and that the velocity with which {{the surface of the}} mass moves, in the general rotation, is precisely that velocity with which Neptune now revolves about the Sun. At this epoch, then, we are to understand that the constantly increasing centrifugal force, having gotten the better of the non-increasing centripetal, loosened and separated the exterior and least condensed stratum, or a few of the exterior and least condensed strata, at the equator of the sphere, where the <b>tangential</b> <b>velocity</b> predominated; so that these strata formed about the main body an independent ring encircling the equatorial regions:—just as the exterior portion thrown off, by excessive velocity of rotation, from a grindstone, would form a ring about the grindstone, but for the solidity of the superficial material: were this caoutchouc, or anything similar in consistency, precisely the phænomenon I describe would be presented.|$|E
60|$|Without {{committing}} {{ourselves to}} it {{as more than a}} speculation, though a highly probable one, let us again commence with the evolution of the Solar System out of a nebulous medium. The hypothesis is that from the mutual attraction of the molecules of a diffused mass whose form is unsymmetrical, there results not only condensation but rotation. While the condensation and the rate of rotation go on increasing, the approach of the molecules is necessarily accompanied by an increasing temperature. As the temperature rises, light begins to be evolved; and ultimately there results a revolving sphere of fluid matter radiating intense heat and light--a sun. There are reasons for believing that, in consequence of the higher <b>tangential</b> <b>velocity</b> originally possessed by the outer parts of the condensing nebulous mass, there will be occasional detachments of rotating rings; and that, from the breaking up of these nebulous rings, there will arise masses which {{in the course of their}} condensation repeat the actions of the parent mass, and so produce planets and their satellites--an inference strongly supported by the still extant rings of Saturn. Should it hereafter be satisfactorily shown that planets and satellites were thus generated, a striking illustration will be afforded of the highly heterogeneous effects produced by the primary homogeneous cause; but it will serve our present purpose to point to the fact that from the mutual attraction of the particles of an irregular nebulous mass there result condensation, rotation, heat, and light.|$|E
60|$|After referring, {{however, the}} {{centripetal}} {{force to the}} omniprevalent law of Gravity, {{it has been the}} fashion with astronomical treatises, to seek beyond the limits of mere Nature—that is to say, of Secondary Cause—a solution of the phænomenon of <b>tangential</b> <b>velocity.</b> This latter they attribute directly to a First Cause—to God. The force which carries a stellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the finger—this is the childish phraseology employed—by the finger of Deity itself. In this view, the planets, fully formed, are conceived to have been hurled from the Divine hand, to a position {{in the vicinity of the}} suns, with an impetus mathematically adapted to the masses, or attractive capacities, of the suns themselves. An idea so grossly unphilosophical, although so supinely adopted, could have arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the absolutely accurate adaptation, each to each, of two forces so seemingly independent, one of the other, as are the gravitating and tangential. But it should be remembered that, for a long time, the coincidence between the moon’s rotation and her sidereal revolution—two matters seemingly far more independent than those now considered—was looked upon as positively miraculous; and there was a strong disposition, even among astronomers, to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual agency of God—who, in this case, it was said, had found it necessary to interpose, specially, among his general laws, a set of subsidiary regulations, for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the glories, or perhaps the horrors, of the other side of the Moon—of that mysterious hemisphere which has always avoided, and must perpetually avoid, the telescopic scrutiny of mankind. The advance of Science, however, soon demonstrated—what to the philosophical instinct needed no demonstration—that the one movement is but a portion—something more, even, than a consequence—of the other.|$|E

We find a general constraint over the counterrotating <b>tangential</b> <b>velocities</b> needed to cast the surface energy-momentum tensor of the disk as the superposition of two counterrotating charged dust fluids.

A simple family of models of counterrotating charged disks based on the Kerr-Newman solution are considered where we obtain some disks with a CRM well behaved. We also show that the disks constructed from the Kerr-Newman solution can be interpreted, for all the values of parameters, as a matter distribution with currents and purely azimuthal pressure without heat flow. The models are constructed using the well-known "displace, cut and reflect" method extended to solutions of vacuum Einstein-Maxwell equations. We obtain, in all the cases, counterrotating Kerr-Newman disks that are in agreement with all the energy conditions. Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures, Late...|$|R
