5|$|Efforts <b>to</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> the {{mechanisms}} of sebum production are underway. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E

5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> {{the quantum}} aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some {{physicists}} have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical {{model in which}} spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension.

The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public. An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010, aiming <b>to</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> the historical transition from the Anglo-Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh, to the period of the Norman castle.|$|E
5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. <b>To</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

His first scene was a sex scene with Ramona. Despite leaving the series in 2001, Fay Ripley was persuaded to return to the programme for one last appearance as Jenny in the final episode.
