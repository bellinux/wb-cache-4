5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|Three {{to seven}} eggs (typically four or five) are laid {{approximately}} 24–72 hours apart. The average egg size is , 10% larger than average for birds {{of its body}} size. The eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey splotching. Incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly {{the responsibility of the}} female, although the male incubates 15–20% of the time. Eggs that are lost are typically replaced in 11–12 days. Hatching takes place over three to four days. Hatchlings are altricial, and are only able <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> after five days. They grow very quickly, reaching an adult weight after 16–17 days. After 28–31 days, their wings develop and they are able to leave the nest.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Yokozuna and The Undertaker began at Survivor Series 1993. Yokozuna, who was pushed as an unstoppable monster, {{was unable to}} inflict any serious damage on The Undertaker when the two faced each other in an {{elimination}} match. Yokozuna slammed The Undertaker's head into the steel steps {{leading up to the}} ring, but The Undertaker was unharmed. Later, Yokozuna used his finishing move, the Banzai Drop, on The Undertaker. When he tried to repeat the move, however, The Undertaker became the first wrestler <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> after the move, surprising Yokozuna and his managers. The Undertaker was granted a title shot, but Jim Cornette, Yokozuna's American spokesperson, included a clause in the contract that The Undertaker would not get a rematch if he lost. Paul Bearer, The Undertaker's manager, included a clause stating that the confrontation would take place in a Casket match. In the following weeks, it was revealed that Yokozuna had a fear of caskets. The Undertaker used this knowledge to gain a psychological advantage going into the match. On one occasion, Paul Bearer brought the casket to the ring to intimidate Yokozuna. When Yokozuna approached the casket to face his fear, the Undertaker popped out to scare Yokozuna.|$|E

25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} Charger {{received}} minor changes. Outside, new fender-mounted turn signals were introduced {{and this would}} serve as the main external identifier between a 1966 and 1967 Charger. A vinyl roof became available. Inside, the full length console was eliminated to satisfy customer complaints about the difficulty for entry and exit from the back seats. It was replaced with a regular sized console. Bucket seats were standard, but a folding armrest/seat and column shifter was an option allowing three people <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> front.|$|E

The couple lived privately, but were often overheard laughing {{in the garden of}} their house. Though Tudor's income had been reduced when he left the Hussars and he had no personal fortune, he had enough money to pay for a nurse for Larissa and to keep a horse stabled at a nearby farm.|$|E
25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E

In the first Test match here five seasons later, the Sri Lankans were greeted with an underprepared wicket affording vastly {{unpredictable}} bounce. Dilip Vengsarkar, then at the most dizzying heights of his career, made his highest Test score of 166, his fourth century in eight Tests, when no other batsman on either side crossed 60. The Lankans were rolled over twice as India seized an innings and 67-run victory.

25|$|Ferris was drugged with tranquilizers {{and tied}} to Berdella's bed {{where he was}} {{tortured}} on an almost constant basis for approximately 27 hours. This torture included the repeated administering of 7,700-volt electrical shocks administered to the shoulder and testicles {{for up to five}} minutes in each instance, and acupuncture via hypodermic needles to the neck and genitals. Ferris gradually became delirious, although Berdella continued his physical and sexual assaults upon his victim until he noted in the log he kept upon Ferris: 'Unable <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> more than 10–15 seconds.' This was followed by an entry reading, 'Very delayed breathing.' Shortly thereafter, Berdella wrote that his victim had died with a simple notation translating as 'Stop the project'.|$|E
25|$|As a young child, Gould {{was taught}} piano by his mother. At {{the age of}} 10, he began {{attending}} The Royal Conservatory of Music (known until 1947, when it received a Royal Charter from King George VI, as the Toronto Conservatory of Music) in Toronto. He studied music theory with Leo Smith, the organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back {{as a result of}} a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is almost certainly related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould's mother would urge the young Gould <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> straight at the keyboard. He used this chair for the rest of his life and took it with him almost everywhere. The famous chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low at the keyboard. The chair allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of his teacher at the Conservatory, Alberto Guerrero.|$|E

25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the {{regiment}} landed at Montauk, he came to Long Island City on a furlough, suffering from pernicious malaria. His salary had been discontinued after leaving the regiment, and his wife was forced {{to give up their}} home. They had been staying at the home of a family friend, Mrs. E. Bracken, at 86 Seventh Street before he was taken to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn. He was able <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> unassisted during his first two days, and hoped to return to work, but his condition grew steadily worse over the next two weeks. Doctor Frank E. Brennan treated Ziegner during his time in Long Island City free of charge and providing for the medicine. He also assisted his wife in getting Ziegner admitted to a private hospital but found difficulty in arraigning a carriage. The hospital then had no ambulance, and the Red Cross were unavailable to assist. Local liverymen sometimes hired out their carriages, but none were willing to carry a malaria patient. By the time one was brought around to the house, Ziegner was too weak to ride. After nearly a week and a half, he was finally brought to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn on the night of September 8, 1898. His wife accompanied her husband to the hospital and was allowed to remain at his bedside until he died the next evening. His funeral was held at Mrs. Bracken's home on Sunday afternoon, and he was then buried in Calvary Cemetery. Though they had no children, his wife was expecting their first child {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> in his chair, wouldn't eat his food and licked his plate.

He commented that his wife [...] "had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> in the stands and listen to them cuss me." [...] However, in 1984, after many seasons plagued by injuries and up-and-down play, Simms finally emerged as a team offensive leader. During his 1983 injury, offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt talked Simms into watching more game film, something he had not regularly done in college or the pros. He gained {{a better understanding of}} NFL defenses, his team's formations, and pass protection schemes, and improved his ability to audible at the line of scrimmage. He also changed his strength training regimen in an attempt to make his body more resistant to injury. He passed for 4,044yards (second most in the National Football Conference (NFC), 22 touchdown passes, and led the Giants to a playoff berth.|$|E
