40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{spatial and}} temporal variability in the occurrence of thunderstorms and related precipitation in southern Poland between 1951 and 2010. The analysis was based on thunderstorm observations and daily precipitation totals (broken down into the few ranges) from 15 meteorological stations. It was found that precipitation accompanied {{an overwhelming majority of}} thunderstorms. The most frequent range of <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>precipitation</b> totals was 0. 1 – 10. 0 mm which accounted for 60 % of all values while precipitation higher than 20. 0 mm accounted only for ca. 8 %. During the study period, long-term change in the number of days with <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>precipitation</b> within a certain range displayed no clear-cut trends. Exceptions included: 1) {{an increase in the number}} of days with <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>precipitation</b> in the lowest range of totals (0. 1 – 10. 0 mm) at Katowice, Tarnów, Rzeszów and Lesko and decrease at Mt. Kasprowy Wierch, 2) an increase in the range 10. 1 – 20. 0 mm at Zakopane and 20. 1 – 30. 0 mm at Opole, 3) a decrease of the top range (more than 30. 0 mm) at Mt. Śnieżka. It was found that the heaviest <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>precipitation</b> events, i. e. totalling more than 30 mm, and those events that covered all or most of the study area, occurred at the time of air advection from the southern or eastern sectors and a passage of atmospheric fronts...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{improvement}} of the one-dimensional cold thunderstorm model in view of microphysical parameterization has been presented. We included 32 microphysical processes with six water substances including water vapor, cloud droplet, cloud ice,rain, snow, and hail (graupel) instead of nine cloud microphysical processes with four water substances (water vapor, cloud droplet, rain, and hail). The developed cloud model showed {{a significant effect on}} the precipitation amount and pattern at the ground surface. The maximum rainfall intensity at the surface reached 114 mm/h instead of 34 mm/h. The time period of precipitation became 63 minutes instead of 51 minutes, i. e. it was reduced about 12 minutes. It can be said that the findings of the present study are more reasonable and consistent with the observed <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>precipitation</b> which produces high rainfall intensity naturally {{in a short period of}} time at the surface...|$|E
40|$|Narrow band slices {{have been}} taken of the radio {{emission}} spectrum from convective clouds in the frequency range from 30 mc. /sec. to 550 mc. /sec. and at 7. 5 kc. /sec. to monitor long and short range lightning discharges. Despite the careful choice of the bands to avoid interference from manmade sources, a major problem is the identification of spurious noise. In spite of these interferences, radiation apparently associated with growing convective clouds has been observed from an aircraft. The number of discharges per km. 2 per scc. observed at the different frequencies {{is a function of}} receiver sensitivity, suggesting that “atmospherics ” vary greatly in spectral intensity. The number of discharges observed generally exceeds previous estimates. A relation between the occurrence of sporadic E and major <b>thunderstorm</b> <b>precipitation</b> areas is reported and evaluated in light of previous observations of the similar rclationships. Together, the concepts suggest a linkage between strong solar flare activity and anomolous thunderstorm rainfall...|$|E

40|$|The {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) of the received Loran-C signal {{is one of}} the key factors in determining the usefulness of Loran-C signals for navigation. The presence of increased levels of atmospheric noise can greatly impact the received SNR of Loran signals.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between the occurrence of <b>thunderstorms</b> with heavy <b>precipitation</b> (> 30 mm) and atmospheric circulation types.

500|$|The {{two major}} ways {{thunderstorms}} move are via advection {{of the wind}} and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest [...] of the Earth's atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with <b>thunderstorms</b> with heavy <b>precipitation</b> (HP) than with <b>thunderstorms</b> with low <b>precipitation</b> (LP). When <b>thunderstorms</b> merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.|$|R
50|$|Convection {{occurs when}} the Earth's surface, within a conditionally {{unstable}} or moist atmosphere, becomes heated more than its surroundings, leading to significant evaporation. Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform <b>precipitation</b> <b>thunderstorms.</b>|$|R

Based on the classification and upper-air sounding data, {{they were able to}} determine that increased low-level moisture (e.g., dew point at 850 hPa) and higher instability (e.g., temperature difference between 850 hPa and 500 hPa) would indicate days that were more conducive for lightning-ignited fires.

2500|$|An early {{step in a}} storm {{organizing}} into {{a tornado}} producer is {{the formation of a}} weak echo region (WER) with a tilted updraft. This is an area within the <b>thunderstorm</b> where <b>precipitation</b> should be occurring but is [...] "pulled" [...] aloft by a very strong updraft. The weak echo region is characterized by weak reflectivity with a sharp gradient to strong reflectivity above it and partially surrounding the sides. The region of the precipitation lofted above the WER is the echo overhang consisting of precipitation particles diverging from the storm's summit that descend as they are carried downwind. Within this area, a bounded weak echo region (BWER) may then form above and enclosing the WER. A BWER is found {{near the top of the}} updraft and nearly or completely surrounded by strong reflectivity, and is indicative of a supercell capable of cyclic tornadogenesis. A mesocyclone may descend or a tornado may form in the lower level of the storm simultaneously as the mesocyclone forms.|$|R
