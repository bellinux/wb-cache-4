Specifically, each of <b>the</b> three <b>legs,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> center of mass, {{the connection between the}} center of mass and <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> front <b>leg</b> are all considered to be separate beams. The case when <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> is located between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> center of mass is also formed using six beams: specifically, <b>the</b> three <b>legs,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> middle <b>leg,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> and <b>the</b> center of mass and the connection between the center of mass and <b>the</b> front <b>leg.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>leg</b> is outstretched to {{the side}} while the poi are being swung {{to the side}}s of the body. The poi string or chain makes contact with <b>the</b> outstretched <b>leg,</b> causing <b>the</b> lower portion of the string or chain to be wound round <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> Provided <b>the</b> poi had enough speed when contact with <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> was made, it will wind {{completely}} around <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> with <b>the</b> head impacting <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> <b>The</b> head will then rebound. Pulling upon the string/chain at this point will mean that, again provided there was enough initial speed, the poi completely unwinds from <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> and swings freely in the opposite direction to the one it did initially. At this point the swinger can proceed with another trick.|$|R
40|$|A {{forest of}} hairpin {{vortices}} {{has been accepted}} widely as the common vortex structure in turbulent flow. It is commonly believed that <b>the</b> hairpin has <b>leg,</b> neck and ring head and <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> is attached on the wall.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legs</b> are {{composed}} of seven segments, and attach {{on the underside of}} the body. <b>The</b> <b>legs</b> of an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no millipede has been discovered with 1,000 legs: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and the record is held by Illacme plenipes, with individuals possessing up to 750 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legs</b> are reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|The owls {{shown are}} recognizable, but not sculpted naturalistically: {{the shape of}} the beak, the length of <b>the</b> <b>legs,</b> and details of plumage deviate from those of the owls that are {{indigenous}} to the region. Their plumage is colored like the deity's wings in red, black and white; it is bilaterally similar but not perfectly symmetrical. Both owls have one more feather on the right-hand side of their plumage than on the left-hand side. <b>The</b> <b>legs,</b> feet and talons are red.|$|E

5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{belong to}} a group known as archosaurs, which also {{includes}} modern crocodilians. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait.

5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. <b>The</b> <b>legs</b> are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches.
