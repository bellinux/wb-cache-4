5|$|Mercator's {{editions of}} Ptolemy and his {{theological}} writings were in print {{for many years}} after {{the demise of the}} atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy. His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was Edward Wright who first clarified the method in his book Certaine Errors (1599)—the relevant error being the erroneous belief <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> lines on conventional charts corresponded to constant courses. Wright's solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before the projection formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator projection, also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using the projection appeared throughout {{the first half of the}} seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator projection, with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage the projection made the unfortunate leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes. Recently Mercator's projection has been rejected for representations of the world but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.|$|E

25|$|When forming any sphere-packing lattice, {{the first}} fact to notice is that {{whenever}} two spheres touch {{a straight line}} may {{be drawn from the}} center of one sphere {{to the center of the}} other intersecting the point of contact. The distance between the centers along the shortest path namely <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> line will therefore be r1+r2 where r1 is the radius of the first sphere and r2 is the radius of the second. In close packing all of the spheres share a common radius, r. Therefore two centers would simply have a distance 2r.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 2000s, only small groups of militant straight edge individuals remained. Contrary to news reports that portrayed straight edge as a gang, several studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people. In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance of people who do not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge individuals. In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to metalcore to posicore. Straight edge bands from the 2000s include Champion, Down to Nothing, Embrace Today, Have Heart, and Throwdown.|$|E

In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> edge had gone through three eras since its founding in the early 1980s. Later analysts have identified another era that has taken place since Tsitsos's writing. Straight edge grew out of hardcore punk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was partly characterized by shouted rather than sung vocals. Straight edge individuals of this early era often associated with the original punk ideals such as individualism, disdain for work and school, and live-for-the-moment attitudes.|$|E

On August 16, 2015, at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards (where Furious 7 received {{the award for}} Choice Movie – Action and Walker received the award for Choice Movie Actor – Action), Diesel gave the film the initial title Fast 8. In September 2015, Diesel stated that the script had almost been completed, and expressed interest in Rob Cohen, who directed the first film, to direct the eighth installment. On October 14, 2015, Diesel announced on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon <b>that</b> <b>Straight</b> Outta Compton director F. Gary Gray would direct the film.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> edge {{had gone}} through three eras since its {{founding}} in the early 1980s. Bent edge began as a counter-movement to straight edge by members of the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene. During the youth crew era, which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight edge scene was at an all-time high. By the early 1990s, militant straight edge was a well-known part of the wider punk scene. In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South America. By the beginning of the 2000s, militant straight edge punks had largely left the broader straight edge culture and movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{convoluted}} {{tubes of}} early designs {{such as the}} du Temple and Normand {{were the first to}} go. A multi-row bank of tubes could provide adequate heating area, without this complexity. Tubes also became straighter, mostly to ease their cleaning. Yarrow had demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> tubes did not cause any problems with expansion, but circular drums and perpendicular tube entry were both valuable features for a long service life. Where tubes entered drums at an angle, heating and cooling tended to bend the tube back and forth, leading to leaks. A perpendicular entry was easier to expand the tubes for a reliable seal and to avoid these sideways stresses. It was worth the compromise of the Admiralty boiler's bent tube ends to keep these two features, and these tubes were still simple enough in shape to clean easily.|$|E
25|$|Another room, {{designed}} by Michael Inchbald, where QE2s advanced interior design was demonstrated {{was the first}} class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the ceiling height, created an impression of airy openness above {{to deal with the}} otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend into the ceiling and to lose the visual indication of low ceiling height <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Michael Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The indirect lighting from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier {{praised the}} album, {{awarding}} the album {{four out of}} five stars. Birchmeier noted that [...] "the album plays like a humorous, self-centered twist on Straight Outta Compton with Eazy-E, the most charismatic member of N.W.A, front and center while his associates are busy behind the scenes, producing the beats and writing the songs." [...] He compared it to N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton, which Eazy also performs on, saying <b>that</b> <b>Straight</b> Outta Compton is [...] "more revolutionary," [...] but claimed Eazy-Duz-It to be Straight Outta Comptons [...] "great companion" [...] and to have showcased N.W.A's style.|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} a gay {{character}} in a starring role is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter, who appears in comic books first published by Wildstorm. The Batman-like Midnighter was revealed {{to be in a}} relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. The portrayal of the relationship was initially subtle, with writer Warren Ellis not informing the artist of his intentions. However, the DC editorial board still censored a kiss between the two characters in 2000. Described as the [...] "first openly gay couple in comics," [...] Midnighter and Apollo married in a later issue and have an adopted daughter. Midnighter starred in his own solo title from 2006; the Midnighter comic was criticised by François Peneaud for ignoring the protagonist's relationship with his husband, and also for the continual use of homophobic insults by villains. Criticism has also been leveled at a storyline in which Apollo is raped, with critics saying <b>that</b> <b>straight</b> superheroes are never subjected to such treatment. Alan Moore pointed to the characters as an example of comics' [...] "strange attitude" [...] towards LGBT themes, describing them as [...] "vicious muscle queens." [...] Starting 2015, Midnighter once again stars in his own solo series, published from DC Comics, making him the first gay male superhero to have his own series in a mainstream publisher.|$|E
500|$|Al Shipley of Stylus {{gave the}} album a [...] "B–" [...] and felt that, while [...] "White & Nerdy" [...] {{was a solid}} parody, the other spoofs on the album were not quite up to par. He praised [...] "Pancreas" [...] and [...] "Virus Alert" [...] as the album's best style parodies, {{comparing}} the latter to the 1985 single [...] "Dare to Be Stupid", while criticizing [...] "I'll Sue Ya", [...] "Close but No Cigar", and [...] "Don't Download This Song". Shipley concluded that the most hilarious moment on the album was Yankovic singing the lyrics to [...] "Candy Shop" [...] by 50 Cent over a polka beat in [...] "Polkarama!" [...] Scott Shetler of Slant Magazine awarded the album three stars out of five. He felt that in the 2000s, Yankovic's work had gradually declined in quality, but <b>that</b> <b>Straight</b> Outta Lynwood displayed [...] "occasional flashes of genius", such as [...] "White & Nerdy", which he praised for Yankovic's rapping ability. Shetler also felt that [...] "Trapped in the Drive-Thru", was impressive, although he noted {{it was not as}} spectacular as it could have been. Once again, [...] "Confessions, Pt. III" [...] and [...] "Do I Creep You Out" [...] were described as [...] "throwaways". However, Shetler wrote that [...] "for once, Yankovic's originals are better than his parodies", highlighting [...] "Pancreas", [...] "I'll Sue Ya", and [...] "Don't Download This Song" [...] as the best songs on the album.|$|E

However, veganism is not seen as a matter of personal purity, but rather is rooted in strong belief in animal rights, and a means of personally rejecting the exploitation of animals. Some hold that veganism is [...] "true straight edge", and their promotion of veganism and animal liberation has been described as evangelistic.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 2002, Houston did an {{interview}} with Diane Sawyer to promote her then-upcoming album. During the prime-time special, Houston spoke on topics including rumored drug use and marriage.

2500|$|The review {{concluded}} that the album was [...] "curiously uninvolving" [...] and that it [...] "lacks the insight and passion that put the best work {{by the likes of}} Boogie Down Productions, Ice-T and Public Enemy so far ahead of the field." [...] The Richmond Times-Dispatchs Mark Holmberg described the album as [...] "a preacher-provoking, mother-maddening, reality-stinks diatribe that wallows in gangs, doping, drive-by shootings, brutal sexism, cop slamming and racism". Newsweek noted <b>that</b> <b>Straight</b> Outta Compton [...] "introduced some of the most grotesquely exciting music ever made", and added that [...] "Hinting at gang roots, and selling themselves on those hints, they project a gangster mystique that pays no attention where criminality begins and marketing lets off".|$|E
