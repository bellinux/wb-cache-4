50|$|Thallium(I) sulfate (Tl2SO4) or <b>thallous</b> <b>sulfate</b> is the sulfate salt of {{thallium}} in {{the common}} +1 oxidation state, {{as indicated by the}} Roman numeral I. It {{is often referred to as}} simply thallium sulfate. Thallium(I) sulfate is colourless, odourless, tasteless, and highly toxic.|$|E
40|$|A defined agar medium (hereinafter {{designated}} caprylate-thallous [CT 5 agar) containing 0. 01 % yeast extract, 0. 1 % caprylic (n-octanoic) acid, and 0. 025 % <b>thallous</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{is highly}} selective for all Serratia species and effectively discriminates against most non-Serratia strains {{likely to be}} in the same habitats. The selectivity of CT agar is demonstrated by the very high efficiency of colony formation (mean, 80. 7 % of that on a nonselective complex medium) on CT agar by known Serratia strains and the very low efficiency of colony formation (close to zero) on CT agar by bacterial strains known not to be Serratia. The utility of this medium in actual clinical laboratory practice is demonstrated by the more rapid and higher recovery of Serratia on this selective medium as compared to conventional procedures of in-tandem runs of 513 consecutive urine, feces, and sputum specimens. Pigmented and nonpigmented Serratia strains deliberately added to fecal specimens can be selectively and quantitatively recovered on CT agar. CT agar compares favorably with, or in some cases is an improvement over, other selective media which have been recommended for isolating Serratia. This selective CT agar medium could be quite useful in ecological surveys, especially those related to hospital-acquired infections...|$|E
