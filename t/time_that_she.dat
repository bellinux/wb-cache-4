5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress {{as a man}} was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth.

5|$|Baeyertz {{was born}} as Emilia Louise Aronson on 29 March 1842 in Bangor, North Wales. Her family were wealthy {{orthodox}} Jews, {{and she was}} brought up to strict Jewish ideals. She attended school for a while but, by the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> reached thirteen, her family removed her from formal education and she remained at home due to her ill health. Instead, she spent her time with her mother, who used to read Shakespeare to her, and would spend time in her family's library practising reading aloud.|$|E
5|$|Before he met Mrs. Jordan, William had {{an illegitimate}} son whose mother is unknown; the son, also called William, drowned off Madagascar in HMS Blenheim in February 1807. Caroline von Linsingen, {{whose father was}} a general in the Hanoverian infantry, claimed {{to have had a}} son, Heinrich, by William in around 1790 but William was not in Hanover at the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> claims and the story is {{considered}} implausible by historians.|$|E
5|$|By 1969 she was {{studying}} architecture at the University of Indonesia. It {{was at this}} <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> saw a performance of Kasidah Berzanji (The Berzanji Chant) by a troupe led by Willibrordus S. Rendra, which convinced her {{to drop out of}} university and join the troupe. In 1974 she founded Satu Merah Panggung Theater, which performed adaptations of foreign works such as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet– in the latter, Sarumpaet played the titular role.|$|E

5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|She {{worked on}} several {{television}} series between 1993 and 2003 before joining The O.C.s writing staff, eventually leaving {{the show to}} write the 2006 film Step Up.

She wrote her second produced screenplay, a film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's novel Twilight in 2007 and has since adapted the novel's three sequels, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.|$|E
5|$|Estianty {{was born}} in Surabaya, East Java, and showed {{interest}} in music at an early age, winning a marching band competition while still in elementary school. She began training as a disc jockey while still in junior high school; it was around this <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> first met Dhani. After studying at the University of Indonesia, Estianty joined Dewa 19 as a backing vocalist. In 1999, she and Dhani {{came up with the}} idea for the musical duo Ratu. Estianty played the music, while other women– first Pinkan Mambo, then Mulan Jameela– sang. Ratu was highly successful. After the dissolution of the band in 2007 and a bitter divorce in September 2008, Estianty formed Duo Maia with Mey Chan. She is currently focusing on producing music with her label, Le Moesik.|$|E

5|$|From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising {{as one of}} {{her main}} residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had {{increased}} to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal lifestyle in Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite her large income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> took over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the existing kitchen was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. A brick wall around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.|$|E
5|$|In February 1925, she {{was sold}} again, {{this time to}} a French {{fisherman}} named Victor Fourny. She was renamed Professeur Bergonié, after Jean Bergonié, and registered at Boulogne. After several years in France, the Boston Deep Sea Fishing repurchased her on 4 March 1930, and she was renamed again, this time to the Daily Chronicle (FD69), registered at Fleetwood. She also returned to the same manager as in Boston, Fred Parkes. It was during this <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had her first unusual duty– on 5 July 1933, she was chartered by the Italian Government to support a transatlantic flight by 24 Savoia-Marchetti S.55X seaplanes. The flight was led by General Italo Balbo, and covered , from Orbetello to Chicago, via Iceland, in 47 hours 52 minutes. She collided with the steam trawler Jacinta (FD235) at St Kilda fishing grounds on 12 August 1934. Although the starboard side of Jacinta was damaged, the Daily Chronicle remained undamaged. On 5 November 1934, her registry at Fleetwood ended, and she was sold to Thomas L Devlin & Sons of Granton, registered there, and renamed Commodator (GN6).|$|E
5|$|It {{was around}} this <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{switched}} from attending the local Congregational church, {{where she had}} been baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church. The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery. He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was devoutly religious, actively supported her new church as she had her old.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a mile from the Martens' cottage. This was the last <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Elizabeth Hall {{was born}} on November 30, 1939, in Independence, Missouri. When she was in junior high, Doris and Eugene Hall moved the family to Washington, {{but by the time}} Sharon was fifteen they had {{returned}} to Missouri, where Sharon attended William Chrisman High School. Sixteen-year-old Sharon met twenty-two-year-old college student James Kinne at a church function in the summer of 1956, and the couple dated regularly until Kinne returned to Brigham Young University in the fall. Sharon, reportedly deeply interested in finding a partner with prospects and who could take her away from Independence, soon wrote a letter to Kinne at school informing him that she was pregnant by him. Kinne took leave from his college and returned to Independence, where he married Sharon on October 18, 1956. The couple's marriage license identified sixteen-year-old Sharon as being eighteen and a widow; though she later refused to address the assertion, Sharon told people at the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been married when she lived in Washington, to a man who later died in a car accident. The new couple held a second, more formal wedding the next year in the Salt Lake Temple, after Sharon had completed the process of converting to Mormonism.|$|E
