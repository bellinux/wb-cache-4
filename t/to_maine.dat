5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient between Carrie {{and the high}} pressure area to its north produced gusty northeasterly winds, and by extension high seas. In response, the National Weather Service issued small craft warnings starting on September 1 and extending from Massachusetts to the Carolinas. Gale warnings were posted the next day from southern New Jersey to the coast of central New England, and the small craft warnings were brought north <b>to</b> <b>Maine.</b> Ongoing, {{as well as the}} threat of continued heavy rainfall necessitated the issuance of flash flood watches throughout eastern Massachusetts, southeastern New Hampshire, and southern and central Maine on September 3. Due to rough surf, the beach at Virginia Beach, Virginia was closed to swimmers on August 31.|$|E
5|$|The {{west coast}} of Canada by 7,000–5000BCE (9,000–7,000years ago) saw various {{cultures}} who organized themselves around salmon fishing.

The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America's Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic.
