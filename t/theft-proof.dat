These features included a heater, <b>theft-proof</b> locks, rotary door-latches, defroster vents, dual horns, full-wheel covers, ashtray, and a lighted ignition switch that were typical extras on the competing makes. While the inclusion of a passenger compartment heater as standard may be unusual to present day car users, even the high-priced Cadillac still counted a passenger compartment heater as extra in 1953, at an option cost of US$199.|$|E

5000|$|Disappointed by today's politicians, {{they are}} {{currently}} working on a viable version of government that will begin to seriously address and solve the planet's urgent challenges, {{and at the same time}} put in place a <b>theft-proof</b> way to keep sticky political fingers from tax-payers money. Evans holds the opinion that permanently closing 'the best club in London', the redundant and massively expensive-to-run Houses of Parliament, would make a good starting point for a significant and down-to-earth money-saving campaign."With the availability of video-conferencing there's no longer a need for Parliament as such. The people's representatives should live and work in their constituencies, not be swanning around wasting our money." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gram Power is {{an energy}} {{technology}} company founded in 2010 out of University of California Berkeley. The company provides cutting edge Smart Grid technologies {{to address the}} electrification challenges in developing nations. Its founders are Yashraj Khaitan (an Indian), and Jacob Dickinson (an American), engineering graduates of University of California, Berkeley, who are being mentored by Eric Brewer, a vice-president of infrastructure at Google {{and a professor at}} Berkeley. They set up India's first Solar Powered Smart Microgrid in the Rajasthan hamlet of Khareda Lakshmipura in March 2012, providing energy for lights, buttermilk machines, televisions and fans. Gram Power's core innovation is in their Smart Distribution technology, consisting of their Smart Meters and Grid Monitoring Systems to provide on-demand, <b>theft-proof</b> power with a unique pay-as-you-use schedule that is determined by the end user. The company's operation has been praised by American journalist Thomas Friedman as [...] "the most exciting" [...] energy technology innovation he has seen in India and was selected among the top 10 Cleantech Innovations by NASA in 2011. Gram Power is reportedly [...] "on pace to reach 20,000 homes and have 100 rural telecom towers covered with solar panels for generation" [...] for 2013.|$|E

[Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]For a given signature block and any other data, there exists a key which produces the same signature block. The threat that this poses to schemes which use nested signature blocks as pointers to other tokens is identified, using a <b>theft-proof</b> capability mechanism as an illustration. A modification to public key certificates is then proposed to eliminate this threat...|$|E
40|$|Biometric {{authentication}} {{offers many}} benefits ranging from strong security guarantees to user convenience, however, remote authentication poses unique challenges {{which are not}} fully addressed by biometrics alone. We propose a new remote authentication protocol that combines possessionbased authentication and biometrics {{in a way that}} conquers the main weaknesses of both authentication methods. Our protocol offers strong protection to biometric data. It is <b>theft-proof,</b> guarding against attacks based on stolen or lost tokens. It is also privacy-preserving with respect to the users â€™ biometric identities as well as actions performed using those identities. In contrast to knowledge-based authentication, where passwords or PIN numbers may be updated freely, biometri...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFormer {{research}} {{showed that}} bicyclists particularly valued secure parking and good cycle paths {{to use the}} bicycle as an access mode to trains. In spring 2010, in the Paris region, a stated preference survey was designed and conducted to investigate the preferred types of intermodal bicycle facilities at stations. For that, 18 situations were simulated with photographs and short texts. Each situation combined the values of six attributes: access route (cycle path, none), site protection (open air, shelter, warden, smart card control, lockers), securing provision (nothing, pole, stand, grip), distance to platforms (50 meters, 200 meters), operation time (24 hours, 20 hours, peak hours only), user fee (free, 10 euro per month, 20 euro per month). The {{respondents were asked to}} rate their satisfaction level with the situation on a six-level scale. Respondents were recruited among cyclists by e-mail, on cycling forums and on a bicycle second-hand market. Despite a limited number of respondents, a cumulative logit model could estimate the effects of most attribute items. Respondents were most satisfied with lockers, then simple shelters, and most dissatisfied with fees and lack of cycle paths. Moreover, qualitative comments by respondents helped at understanding how the general quality of the facilities was valued. In particular, despite the relatively low estimation for stands, many comments confirm that they are essential <b>theft-proof</b> devices...|$|E
