40|$|The Cam-clay models, or {{any other}} plasticity-based models, do not make {{distinction}} between the mode of stress transfer in coarse- and fine-grained soils. An examination of behavior at micro level in fine-grained soils, from <b>the</b> <b>consideration</b> of load <b>transfer</b> through physico-chemical interactions, suggests that the plastic compressions result from the grouping of particles into larger clusters and that elastic compressions result from the decrease in the spacing between particles. During shearing, these clusters gradually get dismembered, releasing the locked-in energy. The effect of such dismembering of clusters can be easily incorporated into the original Cam-clay model, and better predictions can be obtained with the associated flow rule, itself, for both normally and over consolidated states. The method essentially defines the hardening of yield surfaces with internal changes in the spacing between particles, instead of changes in externally observed plastic strains. The approach describes the behavior of over consolidated soils as yielding along successfively hardening Roscoe surfaces with gradually varying plastic properties...|$|R

E 88, 033305 (2013) ] where a multiscale numerical scheme based on kinetic model was developed for low speed isothermal flows with arbitrary Knudsen numbers. In this work, a discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) for compressible flows with <b>the</b> <b>consideration</b> of heat <b>transfer</b> and shock discontinuity is developed based on the Shakhov model with an adjustable Prandtl number. The method is an explicit finite-volume scheme where the transport and collision processes are coupled in the evaluation of the fluxes at cell interfaces, so that the nice asymptotic preserving (AP) property is retained, such that the time step is limited only by the CFL number, the distribution function at cell interface recovers to the Chapman-Enskog one in the continuum limit while reduces to that of free-transport for free-molecular flow, and the time and spatial accuracy is of second-order accuracy in smooth region. These features make the DUGKS an ideal method for multiscale compressible flow simulations. A number of numerical tests, including the shock structure problem, the Sod tube problem with different degree of non-equilibrium, and the two-dimensional Riemann problem in continuum and rarefied regimes, are performed to validate the scheme. The comparisons with the results of DSMC and other benchmark data demonstrate that the DUGKS is a reliable and efficient method for multiscale compressible flow computation. Comment: 18 page...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of moving {{a large amount of}} data from several source hosts to a destination host over a wide-area network, i. e., a large-scale data collection problem. This problem is important since improvements in data collection times in many applications such as wide-area upload applications, high-performance computing applications and data mining applications are crucial to performance of those applications. Existing approaches to the large-scale research are transferring data either directly, i. e., direct methods, or using &quot;best&quot;-path type of application-level re-routing techniques, which we refer as non-coordinated methods. However, we believe {{that in the case of}} large-scale data collection applications, it is important to coordinate data transfers from multiple sources. More specifically, our coordinated method would take into <b>consideration</b> <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> demands of all source hosts and then schedule all data transfers in parallel by using all possible existing paths between the source hosts and the destination host. We present a performance and robustness study of different data collection methods. Our results showed that coordinated methods can perform significantly better than non-coordinated and direct methods under various degrees and types of network congestion. Moreover, we also showed that coordinated methods are more robust than non-coordinated methods under inaccuracies in network condition information. Therefore, we believe that coordinated methods are a promising approach to large-scale data collection problems...|$|R
40|$|When {{looking at}} railway planning, a {{discrepancy}} exists between planners who {{focus on the}} train operations and publish fixed railway schedules, and passengers who look {{not only at the}} schedules but also at the entirety of their trip, from access to waiting to on-board travel and egress. Looking into this discrepancy is essential, as assessing railway performances by merely measuring train punctuality would provide an unfair picture of the level of service experienced by passengers. Firstly, passengers’ delays are often significantly larger than the train delays responsible for the passengers to be late. Secondly, trains’ punctuality is often strictly related to too tight schedules that in turn might translate into knock-on delays for longer dwelling times at stations, trip delays for increased risk of missing transfer connections, and uncertain assessment of the level of service experienced, especially with fluctuating passenger demand. A key aspect is the robustness of railway timetables. Empirical evidence indicates that passengers give more importance to travel time certainty than travel time reductions, as passengers associate an inherent disutility with travel time uncertainty. This disutility may be broadly interpreted as an anxiety cost for the need for having contingency plans in case of disruptions, and may be looked at as the motivator for the need for delay-robust railway timetables. Interestingly, passenger-oriented optimisation studies considering robustness in railway planning typically limit their emphasis on passengers to <b>the</b> <b>consideration</b> of <b>transfer</b> maintenance. Clearly, passengers’ travel behaviour is far more complex and multi-faceted and thus several other aspects should be considered, as becoming more and more evident from passenger surveys. The current literature review starts by looking at the parameters that railway optimisation/planning studies are focused on and the key performance indicators that impact railway planning. The attention then turns to the parameters influencing passengers’ perceptions and travel experiences. Finally, the review proposes guidelines on how to reduce the gap between the operators’ railway planning and performance measurement {{on the one hand and}} the passengers’ perception of the railway performance on the other hand. Thereby, the conclusions create a foundation for a more passenger-oriented railway timetabling ensuring that passengers are provided with the best service possible with the resources available...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} {{processes}} leading to inappropriate use of medicines for elderly patients admitted for acute care. DESIGN: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews with doctors, nurses, and pharmacists; focus groups with inpatients; and observation on the ward by clinical pharmacists for one month. SETTING: Five acute wards for {{care of the}} elderly in Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: 5 doctors, 4 nurses, and 3 pharmacists from five acute wards for the interviews; all professionals and patients on two acute wards for the observation and 17 patients (from the same two wards) for the focus groups. RESULTS: Several factors contributed to inappropriate prescribing, counselling, and transfer of information on medicines to primary care. Firstly, review of treatment was driven by acute <b>considerations,</b> <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> of information on medicines from primary to secondary care was limited, and prescribing was often not tailored to elderly patients. Secondly, some doctors had a passive attitude towards learning: {{they thought it would}} take too long to find the information they needed about medicines and lacked self directed learning. Finally, a paternalistic doctor-patient relationship and difficulties in sharing decisions about treatment between prescribers led to inappropriate use of medicines. Several factors, such as the input of geriatricians and good communication between members of the multidisciplinary geriatric team, led to better use of medicines. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, improvements targeted at the abilities of individuals, better doctor-patient and doctor-doctor relationships, and systems for transferring information between care settings will increase the appropriate use of medicines in elderly people...|$|R

This was done via a theoretical introduction to two groups of first year degree participants to new methods of analyzing speech, expecting an awareness raising of vocal tract configuration and perhaps a subsequent change in the values of pre-voiced VOT, approaching to a native English-like realization of voiced plosives.
