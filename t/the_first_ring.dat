5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> <b>Ring</b> made an unbeaten three as Australia scored 236. He bowled five overs without {{success in the}} first innings, before {{removing}} four of the first five batsmen in the second innings and ending with 4/20. Scotland made 85 and 111 to lose by an innings. In the second match, Ring was the costliest bowler in the first innings, conceding 42 runs without success in Scotland's 178. After Australia declared at 6/407, Ring took the leading figures of 4/30, including the wickets of both openers as Australia ended the tour with another innings triumph.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> is a field.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} was the Battlebowl battle royal. All twenty wrestlers started in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring.</b> Elimination from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> {{occurs when a}} wrestler is thrown over the top rope and into the second ring. Elimination from the second ring occurs when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope to the floor. This {{continues}} until one wrestler remained in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring,</b> {{and one in the}} second ring. Elimination then occurs when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope to the floor. The remaining wrestler will be the winner. The wrestlers fought in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring,</b> on the entrance ramp and at ringside. The final four remaining in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> were Sting, Rick Rude, Lex Luger and Big Van Vader. Sting and Rude exchanged punches until they eliminated each other from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring.</b> Vader dominated Luger with a big splash and a body avalanche. Luger fought back, and eliminated Vader with a clothesline to become the last wrestler remaining in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the event was a Two-Ring King of the Hill Battle Royal. The match {{consisted}} of two rings. The rules were that once a competitor was tossed out of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring,</b> he would battle in the second ring. The last competitor standing in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> would be the winner of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> and the eliminated participants would compete in the second ring. The last competitor of the second ring would compete against the winner of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> in a standard wrestling match. The participants of the match were Eddie Gilbert, Terry Gordy, Scott Hall, Bill Irwin, Brian Pillman, Ranger Ross, Mike Rotunda, Ron Simmons, Rick Steiner, Scott Steiner, Steve Williams, Kevin Sullivan, Sid Vicious and Dan Spivey. Ross and Simmons were the first two participants to be tossed out of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> and battle {{each other in the}} second ring. All the participants with the exception of Pillman and Vicious were tossed out of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> and battled in the second ring. Pillman and Vicious fought against each other in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring,</b> with Sid eventually eliminating Pillman by avoiding a Diving Crossbody and tossing him over the top rope. As a result, Sid won the Battle Royal of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring.</b> The action continued in the second ring as Williams eliminated Irwin and Rotunda and Spivey eliminated Pillman by double-teaming him. Williams delivered a Powerslam to Rotunda and eliminated him. He battled Spivey until Rotunda distracted Williams. This allowed Spivey to deliver a Clothesline to Williams and eliminate him to win the Battle Royal in the second ring. This set up a match between Vicious and Spivey but their manager Teddy Long announced that the two would split the reward of $50,000.|$|E

5000|$|In the 16th {{century the}} number of bells in some towers increased. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>rings</b> {{of five or six}} bells were in four churches: San Zeno, Santa Maria in Organo, Santa Maria della Scala and Santa Anastasia.

25|$|Unlike most Dutch towns, Maastricht did {{not receive}} city rights at a certain date. These {{developed}} gradually during its long history. In 1204 the city's dual authority was formalised in a treaty, with the prince-bishops of Liège and the dukes of Brabant holding joint sovereignty over the city. Soon afterwards <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> of medieval walls were built. In 1275, the old Roman bridge collapsed {{under the weight of}} a large procession, killing 400 people; a replacement, the Sint Servaasbrug, was built to the north from 1280 to 1298, funded by church indulgences.|$|E

25|$|Palermo has {{at least}} two rings of city walls, many pieces of which still survive. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> {{surrounded}} the ancient core of the Phoenician city – the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuova) and the Neapolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road east–west through this early walled city. The {{eastern edge of the}} walled city was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porto Nuovo.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is home to}} one of {{the oldest}} parishes on the Canterbury plains. Established in 1853, St Paul's Anglican Church on Harewood Road was {{enlarged}} twice before being rebuilt using Kauri timber in 1877 to the design of the notable architect Benjamin Mountfort. In 1880 a peal of five bells was presented to the church by Mr J T Matson. This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> of bells suitable for change ringing to be installed in New Zealand and is the only ringable set in the country of eight bells housed in a wooden tower. St Paul's has the additional distinction of being the only parish church in New Zealand with bells for change ringing – the other rings are in cathedrals. The original ring of five bells was ordered in 1878. Some time later, ringing was suspended because the tower was no longer strong enough but a new one was constructed in 1912 and it was again strengthened in 1981 by an internal steel frame. The set is a light weight ring for change ringing with the tenor at 317kg which protects the tower. A sixth bell was added in 1970 and two more in 1983.|$|E
500|$|In 1700 the old ring of six bells was {{replaced}} by a new ring of eight. All but the tenor still survive. In 1770 two lighter bells were added to create <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ring</b> of ten bells in the diocese. The tenor was recast in 1870. [...] The abbey's tower is now home to a ring of ten bells, which are– unusually– hung so that the order of the bells from highest to lowest runs anti-clockwise around the ringing chamber. The tenor weighs 33cwt (3,721lb or 1,688kg). Bath is a noted centre of change ringing in the West Country.|$|E
