5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} play by the Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between <b>two</b> <b>characters</b> during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the unfolding of the drama.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's ninth play, the {{unsuccessful}} The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home, ran {{for four}} nights as a companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies but was soon after replaced by The Welsh Opera on 22 April 1731. The play followed <b>two</b> <b>characters</b> whose wives are busy having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep their wives faithful.

5|$|In The Tempest, Shakespeare {{presents}} {{two powerful}} sorcerers, Prospero and Sycorax, who have both controlled the island. Initially {{it appears that}} the <b>two</b> <b>characters</b> are a contrasting pair: the benevolent Prospero and the rapacious Sycorax. However, upon closer analysis, the differences between the <b>two</b> <b>characters</b> disappear and the similarities grow. For example, Prospero, like Sycorax, coerces Ariel into doing his bidding, using the sprite to regain his inheritance as a Duke, and tortures Caliban with magic the way Sycorax tortured Ariel. Also, both Prospero and Sycorax were exiled from their respective homelands and both have children, which was possibly the reason why they were both spared being executed. The fine line between Sycorax's black magic and Prospero's white blurs even further during his renunciation of magic in Act V, a speech which has strong parallels to one given by the dark witch Medea in the Metamorphoses. In comparing himself to Medea, Prospero is implicitly comparing himself to Sycorax. Emphasizing the relationship between Prospero and Sycorax demonstrates the ambiguity of Prospero's supposedly benevolent character.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stories Laureline {{generally}} {{sits in the}} background while Valérian saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves, but her position changes as the series develops.

5|$|Series co-creator Larry David {{wrote the}} episode in a {{response}} to NBC's continued efforts to get the <b>two</b> <b>characters</b> back together.

Critics reacted positively to the episode, and David received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{terms are}} used in taxonomic research. Primary {{homology}} is the initial hypothesis made by a researcher based on similar structure or anatomical connections, inferring that <b>two</b> <b>characters</b> share an ancestry. Secondary homology is implied by parsimony analysis, where a character that only occurs once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As implied in this definition, many cladists consider homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.|$|E
