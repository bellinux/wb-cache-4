Dear Members: I enjoyed {{hearing from}} <b>you</b> <b>again</b> {{and would like}} to take this {{opportunity}} to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for your gift. Your letters bring back many memories and above all it is interesting to learn what is going on at Bryant now. At the present time I am stationed at Ellis Island, New York working in the pay office. I am very fortunate to be so near New York city because of the many places a service man can go. For night life and entertainment it can’t be beat.

There is something so disagreeable in having a personal contact with a publisher. So {{it is better to}} work through a lawyer--and lose your case. I understand that the publishers have been meeting together also like us. I don't know what for, but possibly they are devising new and mysterious ways for remunerating authors.

60|$|I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> <b>for</b> your letter, and I {{thank you}} very kindly indeed for the volume of Beardsley's letters, by which I have been greatly touched. I knew him a little, and he was himself to my vision touching, and {{extremely}} individual; but I hated his productions and thought them extraordinarily base--and couldn't find (perhaps didn't try enough to find!) the formula that reconciled this baseness, aesthetically, with his being so perfect {{a case of the}} artistic spirit. But now the personal spirit in him, the beauty of nature, is disclosed to me by your letter as wonderful and, in the conditions and circumstances, deeply pathetic and interesting. The amenity, the intelligence, the patience and grace and play of mind and of temper--how charming and individual an exhibition!...And very right have you been to publish the letters, for which Father Gray's claim is indeed supported. The poor boy remains quite one of the few distinguished images on the roll of young English genius brutally clipped, a victim of victims, given the vivacity of his endowment. I am glad I have three or four very definite--though one of them rather disconcerting--recollections of him.|$|E
6000|$|Let me <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> <b>for</b> your {{allusion to}} the {{slightly}} glamour-tinged, but more completely and consistently forbidding and forbidden, lecture possibility. I refer to it in these terms because {{in the first place}} I shouldn't have waited till now for it, but should have waked up to it eleven years ago; and because in the second there are other, and really stouter things too, definite ones, I want to do, with which it would formidably interfere, and which are better worth my resolutely attempting. I never have had such a sense of almost bursting, late in the day though it be, with violent and lately too much repressed creative (again!) intention. I may burst before this intention fairly or completely flowers, of course; but in that case, even, I shall probably explode to a less distressing effect than I should do, under stress of a fatal puncture, on the too personally and physically arduous, and above all too gregariously-assaulted (which is what makes it most arduous) lecture-platform. There is one thing which may conceivably (if it comes within a couple of years) take me again to the contorni of Kittery; and on the spot, once more, one doesn't know what might happen. Then I should take grateful counsel of you with all the appreciation in the world. And I want very much to go back for a certain thoroughly practical and special [...] "artistic" [...] reason; which would depend, however, on my being able to pass my time in an ideal combination of freedom and quiet, rather than in a luridly real one of involved and exasperated exposure and motion. But I may still have to talk to you of this more categorically; and won't worry you with it till then. You wring my heart with your report of your collective Dental pilgrimage to Boston in Mrs Howells' distressful interest. I read of it from your page, somehow, as I read of Siberian or Armenian or Macedonian monstrosities, through a merciful attenuating veil of Distance and Difference, in a column of the Times. The distance is half the globe--and the difference (for me, from the dear lady's active afflictedness) that of having when in America undergone, myself, so prolonged and elaborate a torture, in the Chair of Anguish, that I am now on t'other side of Jordan altogether, with every ghost, even, of a wincing nerve extinct and a horrible inhuman acheless void installed as a substitute.

He offered thanks to the delegation in describing the situation in the world from different perspectives.

[...] "If we can be skillful and diligent, we can find international formulas are in the national interest of member states so as to cross the line between national and international. The Secretary General and I have appreciated the national goals and an historic achievement towards laying the foundations for international development. This is a remarkable chance to follow for member states of the world." [...] With especially strong emphasis on climate change, there was a need to shift course for future generations of the planet. Further, the meeting on refugees and migration coloured the General Debate and the solidarity expressed with such people was to mobilise [...] "around the xenophobia sometimes seen in the world there was a need to see the advantages of people moving even though there are challenges. In regards to the Syrian civil war, {{there is a need to}} move to stop the [...] "horrific fighting and also the need to do the work the UN wants to do when the fighting subsides and then a chance to start a political process, which today looks pretty somber but we cannot loose the sight of it to stop the war." [...] He commended the efforts of the UNGA and UNSC to [...] "sustain peace and to prevent and reduce violence as well as post-conflict work."
