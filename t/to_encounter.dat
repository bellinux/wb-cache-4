5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of building a station in space, space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> surprises during spacewalks, teaching them how to assemble special tools and equipment, and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks. From 1998 to 2005, thirty-seven space shuttle missions were scheduled to assemble, outfit and begin experiments and research aboard the station.|$|E

As per the originals, the other Pokémon can be obtained later on.|$|E

Voyager 2 passed within 10RJ and discovered the current sheet in the equatorial plane. The next probe to approach Jupiter was Ulysses in 1992, which investigated the planet's polar magnetosphere.|$|E

The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS; the Doctor explains about the Silurians and says that he expects <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> {{only a few of}} the creatures.

However, Mrs. Grales has been {{rendered}} unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, and may even be the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: During {{the summer}} of 1992, backpackers were interviewed in Urho Kekkonen National Park in northeastern Finland. As the Finnish Forest and Park Service prepares to deal with {{increasing}} numbers of users at this park, knowl-edge is needed about how visitors respond <b>to</b> <b>encountering</b> other people in various places within the park. For these backpackers, response <b>to</b> <b>encounters</b> with other people is dependent upon whether the encounter is in wilderness or frontcountry zones, the size of group encountered, and whether the group encountered is foreign or from Finland. Most important, a strong majority of visitors indicate that interaction with other backpackers is generally a pleasurable experience and one’to which certain cultural customs apply...|$|R

Turning his force around to investigate, Linois hoped <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> a {{merchant}} convoy but instead discovered the large British second rate HMS London looming out of the darkness ahead. Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were battered and he himself was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of war for the next eight years.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> God.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens <b>to</b> <b>encounter.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{relationship}} between past experience in several trail activities and conflict due <b>to</b> <b>encounters</b> with trail users engaged in those activities. This research question involved the following trail activity groups: runners, walkers or hikers, mountain bikers, horseback riders, and users with dogs. Data were collected through on-site interviews with 421 trail users in the Greater Snow King Area of the Bridger-Teton National Forest near Jackson, Wyoming from July 17 to August 11, 2002. Conflict was assessed by asking participants to rate their increased/decreased enjoyment due <b>to</b> <b>encounters</b> with each of the other user groups. Past experience in an activity was determined by whether a participant had ever participated in that activity on any trail. In tests of the relationship between past experience in an activity and conflict due <b>to</b> <b>encounters</b> with participants of that activity, results indicated that two were statistically significant at the. 05 level (running and walking dogs). Trail users who had participated in the activity in the past experienced less conflict when encountering that group than did respondents who had never done the activity before.

5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E

Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As {{he returned to the}} American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E

5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting <b>to</b> <b>encounter</b> an antigen.|$|E

Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier.
