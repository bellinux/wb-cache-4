40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture <b>the</b> complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of <b>the</b> "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of <b>Fox's</b> imagined community, <b>the</b> real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R

50|$|Ironically, {{unlike most}} CBS {{affiliates}} in the Eastern Time Zone, this station {{does not offer}} a newscast weeknights at 5:30. Therefore, WSYM is the only option for news during that time (all of <b>the</b> <b>Fox</b> affiliate's <b>news</b> broadcasts are actually produced by WILX through an outsourcing agreement). On January 28, 2011, WILX became the first station in Central Michigan to upgrade local newscasts to high definition level (WSYM would eventually follow on June 13). In July 2011, WLNS began airing all of its news programming from a temporary set in the station's breakroom while a new one was constructed in preparation for its own launch of HD news programing. The brand new set debuted on August 26, 2011 during the 5 p.m. newscast while HD newscasts debuted during the 5 p.m. show on October 26, 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The newscasts were branded as Fox 2 Eyewitness News until 1997, when Fox took full {{ownership}} of the station and rebranded its newscasts as Fox 2 News.

By 1998, the station would bolster its image by improving its investigative and consumer advocate unit and branding it as The Problem Solvers. It also adopted a slogan complimentary to Detroit's working class heritage, [...] "News That Works for You". On September 24, 2007, WJBK relaunched an 11 p.m. newscast, using the NewsEdge format originally used by Fox Tampa station WTVT. It also changed its logo, graphics and news theme to an image that became standard on <b>the</b> <b>Fox</b> O&O stations.

2500|$|As of September, Governor Palin had {{submitted}} to two media interviews, the first with ABC's Charles Gibson, and <b>the</b> second with <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> Sean Hannity. Gibson asked Palin, [...] "Do {{you agree with}} the Bush doctrine?," [...] to which Palin responded, [...] "In what respect, Charlie?" [...] After asking Palin for her definition, Gibson defined the concept to be for the United States to [...] "have the right of anticipatory self-defense." [...] Gibson also asked Palin about a prayer she had offered with regard to soldiers in Iraq. Commentators' reactions varied. Those generally critical of Palin's candidacy applauded Gibson's penetrating questions and thought aspects of Palin's responses showed that she was not ready to serve as Vice President, whereas those generally supportive of her candidacy took a more positive view of her performance.|$|R
