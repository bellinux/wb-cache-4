5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphian team {{returned}} to England in 1903. This {{proved to be}} King's most successful tour, particularly his performances in the matches against Lancashire and Surrey. King played in 13 of the 15 matches on the tour, missing two with a strained side. In his first match, against Cambridge University, he took 5 for 136 and 4 for 28. He followed that with 8 for 39 in the first innings against Oxford University, though the match was eventually abandoned as a draw due to rain. In his next match, against Gloucestershire, he took 2 for 26 in the first innings but did not bowl in the second. He also took 7 for 51 and 2 for 28 against a strong MCC side at Lord's. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> Lancashire match at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom proper, {{that is the}} Jaffna peninsula, {{was divided}} into various provinces with subdivisions of parrus meaning {{property}} or larger territorial units and ur or villages, the smallest unit, was administered on a hierarchical and regional basis. At the summit was the king whose kingship was hereditary; he was usually succeeded by his eldest son. Next in the hierarchy stood the adikaris who were the provincial administrators. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> mudaliyars who functioned as judges and interpreters of the laws and customs of the land. It was also their duty to gather information of whatever {{was happening in the}} provinces and report to higher authorities. Administrators of revenues called kankanis or superintendents and kanakkappillais or accountants came next in line. These were also known as pandarapillai. They had to keep records and maintain accounts.|$|E

5|$|When the {{war began}} the Army was {{on the cusp of}} a generational change. At the time, the senior {{officers}} on the active list were Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Thomas Blamey, although Bennett had not held an appointment for seven years and Blamey for the last two. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> Chief of the General Staff, Major General John Lavarack; the Adjutant General, Major General Sir Carl Jess; Major General Owen Phillips, the Quartermaster General; Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman, the commander of the 3rd Division; and Major General Iven Mackay, the commander 2nd Division. All were over 50 years of age and all except Bennett, Drake-Brockman and Mackay were serving or former regular soldiers. Only the first three were considered to command the 6th Division and Second AIF, for which posts Blamey was selected by Prime Minister Menzies. Both Blamey and Lavarack were promoted to lieutenant general on 13 October 1939. Blamey was subsequently appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) I Corps following its raising in March 1940, while Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division and Lavarack assumed command of the newly formed 7th Division.|$|E

25|$|<b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> {{tragedy that}} forever linked Böhme's name with Boelcke. During their sixth mission on 28 October 1916, Böhme, Boelcke, von Richthofen, {{and three other}} pilots from Jasta 2 {{attacked}} two DH-2 scouts from No. 24 Squadron. In the scrambled attack in gusty weather, Richthofen was cut out of his firing approach on one British plane by an interposed German plane. Böhme and Boelcke were both closing on the other.|$|E

Other famous annotators such as Perasiriyar and Naccinarikiniyar wrote commentaries on the various work of Sangam literature. The first Tamil dictionary was attempted by Mandalapurusha who compiled the lexicon Nigandu Cudamani. Thayumanavar, who lived in the early 18th century, is famous for a number of short poems of philosophical nature.|$|E

Drawn matches with Somerset and Glamorgan led up to the first Test.|$|E

25|$|Improvements {{were made}} to the {{original}} design and new models were introduced. The 1948 Vespa 125 had rear suspension and a bigger engine. The headlamp was moved up to the handlebars in 1953 and had more engine power and a restyled rear fairing. A cheaper spartan version was also available. One of the best-loved models was the Vespa 150 GS introduced in 1955 with a 150cc engine, a long saddle, and the faired handlebar-headlamp unit. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> 50cc of 1963, and in 1968 Vespa 125 Primavera {{became one of the most}} durable of all.|$|E
25|$|Plato, in general, {{distinguished}} between {{three types of}} myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with {{the origin of the}} universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul.|$|E
25|$|Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but {{he somehow}} managed to keep the first ball out. The second was a {{harmless}} one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but {{he got back to}} his feet. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, but it was too quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E

25|$|Excavations {{carried out}} in 1934 by H. E. Kilbride-Jones {{on behalf of the}} Ministry of Works, showed that the circle was built in stages. The entire site had first been cleared, leveled and burned by setting fire to piles of willow twigs. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> outer stones, with their bases shaped into points to make them more stable in their gravel bed. They have been {{somewhat}} eroded over time by acidic peat eating away the lower portions of the stones. Oak and hazel were burned within the stone rings, leaving charcoal behind, and cremated human bones were deposited in the ashes within five of the rings. They were then filled with smaller stones to create the cairns visible today.|$|E
25|$|The ambush {{occurred}} at about 16:00 on 14 January, when Japanese {{troops from the}} 5th Division approached, mounted on bicycles, and crossed the bridge unharassed. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> main column, several hundred strong, also cycling, which was followed by tanks and engineer trucks. At this point, the bridge was detonated, sending timber, bicycles and bodies hurtling through the air. B Company, 2/30th Australian Battalion spread out along {{either side of the}} road, concealed in well-protected firing positions, then opened fire and the Japanese column took devastating blows as row upon row of men and equipment were mowed down by machine gun and rifle fire. Most of the Japanese troops tied their rifles to the handlebars of their bicycles making the ambush even more successful for the Australians.|$|E
25|$|The {{human history}} of the Loire river valley begins with the Middle Palaeolithic period of 90–40 kya (thousand years ago), {{followed}} by modern humans (about 30 kya), succeeded by the Neolithic period (6,000 to 4,500BC), all of the recent Stone Age in Europe. <b>Then</b> <b>came</b> <b>the</b> Gauls, the historical tribes in the Loire during the Iron Age period 1500 to 500BC; they used the Loire as a major riverine trading route by 600BC, establishing trade with the Greeks on the Mediterranean coast. Gallic rule ended in the valley in 56BC when Julius Caesar conquered the adjacent provinces for Rome. Christianity was introduced into this valley from the 3rd century AD, as missionaries (many later recognized as saints), converted the pagans. In this period, settlers established vineyards and began producing wines.|$|E
