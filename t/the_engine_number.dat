2500|$|The {{failure of}} the two engines in the second stage was traced to the rupturing of a fuel line that fed the engine igniters. The igniter was {{essentially}} a miniature rocket motor mounted in {{the wall of the}} J-2 engine's pressure chamber. It was fed by small-diameter flexible lines carrying liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. [...] During the S-II second stage burn, the hydrogen line feeding <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>number</b> two igniter broke due to vibration. As a result, the igniter fed pure liquid oxygen into the pressure chamber. Normally the J-2 engine burns a hydrogen-rich mixture to keep temperature down. The liquid oxygen flow caused a much higher temperature locally and eventually the pressure chamber failed. The sudden drop in pressure was detected and caused a shutdown command to be issued. Unfortunately, the command signals for engine three were partially cross-wired with engine two, so that the shutdown of engine two caused a liquid oxygen valve for engine three to close, resulting in a shutdown of that engine as well.|$|E
