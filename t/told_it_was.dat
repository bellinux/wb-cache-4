25|$|Veteran {{republicans}} were {{critical of the}} IRA's Dublin leadership which, for political reasons, had refused to prepare for aggressive action {{in advance of the}} violence. On 24 August Joe Cahill, Seamus Twomey, Dáithí Ó Conaill, Billy McKee and several other future Provisional leaders came together in Belfast intending to remove the Belfast leadership and turn back to traditional militant republicanism. Although the pro-Goulding commander Billy McMillen stayed in command, he was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only for three months and he was not to have any communication with the IRA's Dublin based leadership.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's # 21 to new pitcher Jason Marquis, {{despite the fact}} that it was {{formerly}} worn by Sosa, who coincidentally later hit his 600th home run against Marquis. Ted Lilly, who had also signed with the Cubs that prior winter had requested #31 but was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not available as it was going to be retired for Greg Maddux and Fergie Jenkins, and they were just waiting for Maddux to retire. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.|$|E
25|$|West's {{friend and}} fellow artist Tammy Wynette stated that she had put aside visiting her in the hospital, saying that she planned {{to allow her to}} heal first, {{something}} she admitted to later regretting. In his autobiography, Kenny Rogers, who maintained a close friendship with West, stated that he did pay a visit her in hospital a few times prior to her death. On his last visit (the day of West's death), Rogers recalled that although he was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unlikely that West could hear him, he still spoke to her for a considerable amount of time in the hope she could hear what he was saying.|$|E
25|$|The {{picture on}} the right was {{published}} in Zurich in 1563, in Conrad Gesner's Thierbuch (a compendium of animals) with the captions: 'Englischen Blüthund' and 'Canis Sagax Sanguinarius apud Anglos' (English scent hound with associations of blood). It was drawn by, or under the supervision of, John Caius, and sent to Gesner with other drawings to illustrate his descriptions of British dogs for European readers. It is thus the earliest known picture published specifically to demonstrate {{the appearance of the}} Bloodhound. We are <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done from life, and detail such as the soft hang of the ear indicates it was carefully observed. Fully accurate or not, it suggests changes between the Bloodhound of then and today. The collar and long coiled rope reflect the Bloodhound’s typical functions as a limer or leashed man-trailer in that period.|$|E

25|$|Once selected, {{the cast}} were {{gathered}} together and told by Hiroi and Tanaka of their goals, along with being handed {{pictures of their}} respective characters. The recording sessions were overseen by noted anime and feature film sound director Toshio Sato, who followed Hiroi's request that the characters be portrayed as real people. Sato was initially shocked at being given four script books and being <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just {{one third of the}} entire script. Sato's instruction to the cast was that they would be the characters' main emotive force as their faces would not move much. Sakura was the last character to be recorded, so Sato could concentrate on how to bring out her heroine status alongside the other characters. One of the elements Sato concentrated on was portraying the fractious relationship between newcomer Sakura and established star Sumire. The sheer amount of voice acting was the main reason the game was delayed.|$|E
25|$|Result: Kinetic {{immediately}} left Tussauds, but initially {{suffered a}} lack of organization, with Haya not setting a specific list of who should buy what, which nearly resulted in the team buying two three-piece suits for Tussauds' Justin Bieber waxwork. However, the team generally negotiated well, with James in particular being a stand-out. One item which caused the team trouble was a Dashiki, which they spent the day fruitlessly searching for, with Harry H. being mistakenly <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an Arabic garment instead of an African one. Despite being initially more organized, Atomic's sub-team, Zara and Hayley, wasted time travelling to and from Croydon {{in order to obtain}} a pocketwatch which they paid wildly over the odds for, under the mistaken belief that they were required to purchase one made of gold. On top of that, Harry M. led the team on a wild chase to buy the suit, continually asking adult tailors even after repeatedly being told that they would need to ask a children's tailor for a suit in Bieber's dimensions. Lizzie also made a serious mistake by deciding not to negotiate any discount on a set of shoes {{near the end of the}} day, resulting in a massive fine, with Lord Sugar noting that they would have actually received less of a fine by just not buying the shoes. Kinetic spent £969.10, while Atomic spent £1,480.87.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after losing}} the Green Party nomination, Barr {{announced}} that she would run on the Peace and Freedom Party [...] ticket with activist Cindy Sheehan as her running mate. On August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party. Barr's running mate, Cindy Sheehan, immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee Jill Stein, leading Sheehan to request her name taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late to have her name removed, so she instead announced that she was simply leaving the campaign.|$|E
500|$|For the console's North America release, Sega restyled and rebranded the Mark III {{under the}} name [...] "Master System", similar to Nintendo's own {{reworking}} of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System. The [...] "Master System" [...] name {{was one of several}} proposals Sega's American employees considered, and was ultimately chosen by throwing darts against a whiteboard, although plans to release a cheaper console similarly referred to as the [...] "Base System" [...] also influenced the decision. Sega Enterprises Chairman Isao Okawa endorsed the name after being <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a reference to the competitive nature of both the video game industry and martial arts, in which only one competitor can be the [...] "Master". [...] The futuristic final design for the Master System was intended to appeal to Western tastes.|$|E
500|$|Intellectuals {{regularly}} {{found themselves}} in the Marshalsea. The playwright Ben Jonson, a friend of Shakespeare, was jailed in 1597 for The Isle of Dogs, a play that was immediately suppressed, with no extant copies; on 28 July that year the Privy Council was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "lewd plaie that was plaied {{in one of the}} plaie houses on the Bancke Side, contaynynge very seditious and sclandrous matter". The poet Christopher Brooke was jailed in 1601 for helping 17-year-old Ann More marry John Donne without her father's consent. George Wither, the political satirist, wrote his poem [...] "The Shepherd's Hunting" [...] in 1614 in the Marshalsea; he was held for four months for libel over his Abuses Stript and Whipt, 20 satires criticizing revenge, ambition and lust, one of them directed at the Lord Chancellor.|$|E

[...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game.

500|$|Robinson {{continued}} his provocative approach to journalism, and {{on more than}} one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the Lebanon War, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Bradby, then the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "disrespectful". Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking a difficult question on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from the main issue of the conference, but he argued that [...] "I'm paid to ask questions... particularly at a time when there are incredibly serious allegations... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions." [...] Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup [...] "stage management", and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions.|$|E
500|$|Bradman denied {{this version}} of events. In 1983, two years after Fingleton's death, a book written by Michael Page, with Bradman's close co-operation, blamed Fingleton for the leak and {{dismissed}} Fingleton's story concerning Bradman and Corbett as [...] "an absurd fabrication", arising from a grudge against Bradman. The book pointed out that Fingleton only made the accusation after Corbett's death. Fingleton's executor, Malcolm Gemmell, summarised the evidence which supported Fingleton's accusation in a magazine article: that Bradman wrote for the Sun, was the prime target of Bodyline, and had previously urged the Australian Board of Control to object to the tactic. Fingleton's brother supported the claim that Bradman was responsible, repeating in 1997 the alleged view of Corbett that Bradman provided the information. In 1995, Bradman was interviewed for television, and {{when asked about the}} source of the leak, responded sharply: [...] "It wasn't me!" [...] In the same year, a biography of Bradman, written with his close co-operation, by Roland Perry, said that Bradman had confronted Corbett to ask who leaked the story, to be <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Fingleton.|$|E

500|$|The {{resolution}} {{was brought to}} the House floor on June7, 1924, when Luce asked that the House pass the legislation. [...] He had alluded in his report to the well-known Ralph Waldo Emerson poem [...] "Concord Hymn" [...] by including the phrase [...] "embattled farmers", a reference which Arkansas's Otis Wingo used as an excuse to deliver a lengthy speech on tariffs, accusing the Republican majority of harming the farmer. [...] Once Wingo had finished to applause from the Democratic side, the House passed the bill without a recorded vote, with Rogers presiding over the House {{in the absence of the}} Speaker. The {{resolution was}} transmitted to the Senate the same day and was referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee. On January5, 1925, the resolution was reported back to the Senate by Wyoming's Francis Warren, unamended, with the recommendation that it pass. Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas asked for the amount of the appropriation being made in the bill, and when <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> $15,000, had no additional questions. [...] The bill passed without opposition, and was enacted with the signature of President Coolidge on January14, 1925.|$|E
500|$|Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then {{staying at}} the Gatehouse Prison, {{although}} still not charged with any crime. [...] Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. [...] Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. [...] She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that [...] "particular persons only" [...] were allowed to visit. [...] Hall was again questioned on 7March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. [...] When asked why she had lied to the court, she said [...] "when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but was <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not the truth. [...] I was terrified and threatened {{to be sent to}} Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth." [...] She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of the things about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure.

Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
