50|$|The normal {{operating}} mode of the CPU is called Full Nucleus. All systems also support a limited {{mode of operation}} called Basic Test. In Basic <b>Test</b> <b>mode,</b> Nucleus is disabled, I/O is performed differently, and only a single program can run, restricted to the bottom 64KiB of store, but all other non-nucleus and non-PAS instructions operate normally. This mode is used very early during booting {{to set up the}} system tables required by Nucleus, before obeying a Switch Full Nucleus instruction. Once the system has switched to Full Nucleus, it cannot return to Basic <b>Test</b> <b>mode</b> without operator intervention at the front panel, in effect killing any operating system which was running. Basic <b>Test</b> <b>mode</b> is also used to run certain test software (hence the name).|$|E

If the user press 'on' and 'pause' buttons on the front of the device and inserts one of the top right, bottom left and bottom right battery whilst there are three batteries in the unit, the game will enter <b>test</b> <b>mode</b> and play Happy Birthday To You using the sound that plays the melody during the game. Each color on the <b>test</b> <b>mode</b> will test different functions of the game.

40|$|Strong {{electrostatic}} turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas {{is characterized}} by trapping or eddying of particle trajectories produced by the E × B stochastic drift. Trapping is shown to produce strong effects on test particles and on <b>test</b> <b>modes.</b> It determines non-standard statistics of trajectories: non-Gaussian distribution, memory effects and coherence. Trapped trajectories form quasi-coherent structure. Trajectory trapping has strong nonlinear effects on the <b>test</b> <b>modes</b> on turbulent plasmas. We determine {{the growth rate of}} drift modes as function of the statistical characteristics of the background turbulence. We show that trapping provides the physical mechanism for the inverse cascade observed in drift turbulence and for the zonal flow generation...|$|R

40|$|Online courses {{have created}} a {{different}} testing environment. A test in an online setting can be easily presented in multiple modes (i. e., all at once, one at a time). However, there are no established guidelines to date on how the <b>test</b> presentation <b>modes</b> {{should be used in}} an online test. Using a sample of sixty-five undergraduate students, this study examined if <b>test</b> presentation <b>modes</b> (i. e., all at once, one at a time), student self-perceived learning styles (i. e., surface style, deep style), and types of test problems (i. e., factual/conceptual questions, applied questions) have an effect on student achievement in four unit tests. Findings from one-way MANOVA and repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that <b>test</b> presentation <b>modes</b> alone did not influence student test performance. However, when the variables of student self-perceived learning styles and types of test problems were added, students with a surface style scored significantly higher on the factual/conceptual problems in the one-at-a-time <b>test</b> presentation <b>mode</b> than in the all-at-once <b>test</b> presentation <b>mode.</b> No significant differences were found for students with a deep style in test performance based upon <b>test</b> presentation <b>modes</b> and types of questions.

40|$|In recent decades, with an {{increasing}} application {{of computer technology}} to the delivery of oral language proficiency assessment, there have been renewed debates over the appropriateness of two different <b>testing</b> <b>modes,</b> namely, (a) face-to-face, or direct, testing, and (b) person-to-machine, or semi-direct, testing. Previous research conducted in various geographical regions has produced mixed results as to which format is more acceptable to test takers. The present investigation, {{carried out in the}} context of a university setting in Hong Kong, compared the popularity of two <b>testing</b> <b>modes</b> by analyzing reactions and perceptions of a group of test takers who had just sat for a direct test as well as a semi-direct test. The results indicate that, although a large proportion of the participants had no particular preference in terms of the <b>testing</b> <b>mode,</b> the number of participants who strongly favored direct testing far exceeded the number strongly favoring semi-direct testing. The participants' main reason cited for disliking semi-direct testing was its inability for the examiner and examinee to interact during the test, which appears to have created a psychological barrier for the test taker.
