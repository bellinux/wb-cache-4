25|$|British Eagle and {{its sister}} {{companies}} ceased trading at midnight on 6 November 1968 due to growing financial problems {{and went into}} voluntary liquidation two days later. The airline's last-ever aircraft movement was {{the arrival of a}} Bristol Britannia from Rotterdam at Heathrow the following day. The financial crisis leading to the collapse of Britain's second-largest contemporary independent airline had been triggered by the devaluation of sterling and the tightening of the existing exchange control regime, which limited the amount of foreign exchange British holidaymakers were allowed to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country {{as well as by the}} loss of the company's Caribbean licence. Poor decisions at senior and executive level, the end of the trooping and migrant contracts and economic difficulties had made British Eagle an increasingly unviable business.|$|E

She feels shocked that society hides these injured soldiers away. During Sarah's experience, Prior is examined by a medical board. Prior fears that they suspect he is faking illness and want to send him back to war. While away, Rivers meets with some old friends, Ruth and Henry Head, who discuss Sassoon. Rivers suggests that Sassoon has the freedom to disagree with the war. However, Rivers affirms that {{his job is to}} make Sassoon return to military duty. At the end of their conversation Head offers Rivers a job in London, which Rivers is unsure if he should <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fear of not fulfilling his duties.|$|E

[...] However, it deals with [...] "lots of themes," [...] and [...] "the theme of revolution, of rebellion," [...] and of [...] "how a person can change the course of his life" [...] are the main ones. Similarly, Brühl commented that [...] "there are different things you can <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it" [...] as the film also deals with generational conflict and stories of love and friendship.|$|E
2500|$|On June 20, 2000, the City of New York filed {{a lawsuit}} against gun {{manufacturers}} and distributors. [...] Giuliani accused gun companies of [...] "deliberately manufacturing many more firearms than can be bought for the legitimate purposes of hunting and law enforcement." [...] Giuliani also said, [...] "This lawsuit is meant to end the free pass that gun industry has enjoyed for a very, very long time.... The more guns you <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> society, the more you are going to reduce murder." [...] The lawsuit remains active. [...] During his abortive run for the New York Senate seat in 2000, he advocated a uniform national standard for all gun owners and supported legislation that gave New York State the most restrictive gun laws in the nation.|$|E
2500|$|Bishop {{negotiated}} with the Historical Museum in Peking to be appointed an archaeological adviser to the Chinese government. According to Bishop's plan, the Smithsonian Institution {{was to be the}} sole foreign excavator and exporter of objects, though the work was to be carried out with Chinese colleagues. Unfortunately for these plans, China at this time {{was in a state of}} reaction against foreign intrusions and a foreign archaeologist could not get permission to dig. Fighting between warlord armies made the situation worse, and even Bishop's headquarters in Peking came under gunfire or air raids. Chinese were often suspicious that Westerners had come to China to dig for artifacts to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country. Li Ji left Bishop to join the Academia Sinica, where he went on to become one of the founders of Chinese modern archaeology, and he was one of the Chinese archaeologists who helped to draft laws that prohibited foreigners from conducting digs or exporting antiquities.

2500|$|As he praises Mackintosh's {{impressive}} {{talents and}} intellect, however, Hazlitt also brings out his limitations. In demolishing his adversaries, including Godwin and the reformers {{in his famous}} lectures, Mackintosh [...] "seemed to stand {{with his back to}} the drawers in a metaphysical dispensary, and to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them whatever ingredients suited his purpose. In this way he had an antidote for every error, an answer to every folly. The writings of Burke, Hume, Berkeley, Paley, Lord Bacon, Jeremy Taylor, Grotius, Puffendorf, Cicero, Aristotle, Tacitus, Livy, Sully, Machiavel, Guicciardini, Thuanus, lay open beside him, and he could instantly lay his hand upon the passage, and quote them chapter and verse to the clearing up of all difficulties, and the silencing of all oppugners." [...] But there is a fatal flaw in all this impressive intellectual [...] "juggling" [...] (which, Tom Paulin notes, alludes to Hazlitt's earlier contrast between the deft but mechanical [...] "Indian jugglers" [...] and representatives of true genius): his performances were [...] "philosophical centos", the thoughts of others simply stitched together. [...] "They were profound, brilliant, new to his hearers; but the profundity, the brilliancy, the novelty were not his own." [...] For all his impressive erudition, Mackintosh's writing and speaking are entirely unoriginal.|$|E
2500|$|On February 11, 1970 Cavett {{hosted a}} tribute to the life and works of Sir Noël Coward, who had just been knighted in December 1969. Along with Coward, the other guests were Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, [...] and Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford (who were enjoying a {{successful}} run on Broadway in the revival of Coward's play Private Lives). In reviewing the show for The New York Times, television critic Jack Gould said [...] "The age of youth? Balder dash! The over‐70 set walked off yesterday morning with a television program that combined the engaging qualities of lightly recalled nostalgia, the sophisticated stiletto, and a demonstration of genuine affection that had more substance than adolescent wails on how love will save the world. Sir Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, friends of a lifetime, met on Dick Cavett's show on the American Broadcasting Company network. They exchanged quips, pleasantries and thoughts about the theater with the beguiling charm of talented luminaries. Mr. Cavett was clearly overawed, and for once, the ad libs frequently went over his head. It was an enchanting show…and the badinage was warm and delightful...a fun night, and to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context a line or here or there could not convey the whole. To go to bed with a chuckle provided by gifted and nice people, onstage as off, is review enough." [...] (Jack Gould, The New York Times, February 12, 1970, p.59) ...|$|E
