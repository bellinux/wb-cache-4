Particularly challenging is the final step of the instructional change process, “refreezing,” when after making initial changes in instructional methods, instructors decide whether to continue with new instructional methods or return to their previous methods. Though this stage is important, it is not well studied. Most available studies about ongoing support following professional development on teaching merely state that facilitators made an effort to offer support, or report how frequently participants engaged with online support mechanisms through counting postings on listservs or message boards.

50|$|By using a {{sufficiently}} cold temperature, both water and dopant are frozen in solution together forming an ice sheet.

40|$|Satellite {{altimetry}} and gravimetry {{show that}} the Greenland ice sheet has been losing volume and mass {{since the beginning of}} this century. However, from these short time series of direct measurements we cannot infer what the causes of the mass loss are, i. e. ice dynamics or surface processes, or that maybe the ice sheet returns to normal after a period of volume increase and mass gain. By modelling and observing the individual components of the ice sheet mass balance, i. e. snowfall, meltwater runoff and iceberg production, we are able to identify the processes that led to the recent mass loss. We conclude that the Greenland ice sheet is significantly out of balance. Acceleration of outlet glaciers and increased runoff have contributed equally to recent Greenland mass loss.

RPMI 1640 was as effective as MEM in maintaining sporozoite infectivity while the infectivity in PBS and FCS reached only 59 % and 67 %, respectively. In a second experiment, a stabiiate based on MEM was subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles including various holding times on ice between thawing and refreezing. Refrozen stabilate gave an average sporozoite infectivity loss of 35 % per cycle.

40|$|The spatial {{variability}} of near-surface variables and surface energy balance components over the Greenland ice sheet are presented, using {{the output of}} a regional atmospheric climate model for the period 1958 – 2008. The model was evaluated in Part 1 of this paper. The near-surface temperature over the ice sheet is affected by surface elevation, latitude, longitude, large-scale and small-scale advection, occurrence of summer melt and mesoscale topographical features. The atmospheric boundary layer is characterised by a strong temperature inversion, due to continuous longwave cooling of the surface. In combination with a gently sloping surface the radiative loss maintains a persistent katabatic wind. This radiative heat loss is mainly balanced by turbulent sensible heat transport towards the surface. In summer, the surface is near radiative balance, resulting in lower wind speeds. Absorption of shortwave radiation and a positive subsurface heat flux due <b>to</b> <b>refreezing</b> melt water are heat sources for surface sublimation and melt. The strongest temperature deficits (> 13 °C) are found on the northeastern slopes, where the strongest katabatic winds (> 9 m s&minus; 1 ) and lowest relative humidity (< 65 %) occur. Due to strong large scale winds, clear sky (cloud cover < 0. 5) and a concave surface, a continuous supply of cold dry air is generated, which enhances the katabatic forcing and suppresses subsidence of potentially warmer free atmosphere air...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have shown}} that the firn layer on the Greenland Ice Sheet features subsurface bodies of liquid water {{at the end of the}} winter season. Using a model with basic firn hydrology, thermodynamics, and compaction in one dimension, we find that a combination of moderate to strong surfacemelt and a high annual accumulation rate is required to form such a perennial firn aquifer. The high accumulation rate ensures that there is pore space available to store water at a depth where it is protected from the winter cold. Low-accumulation sites cannot provide sufficiently deep pore space to store liquid water. However, for even higher accumulation rates, the total cold content of the winter accumulation becomes sufficient <b>to</b> <b>refreeze</b> the total amount of liquid water.

40|$|Melting of the Greenland {{ice sheet}} (GrIS) and its {{peripheral}} glaciers and ice caps (GICs) contributes about 43 % to contemporary sea level rise. While patterns of GrIS mass loss are well studied, the {{spatial and temporal}} evolution of GICs mass loss and the acting processes have remained unclear. Here we use a novel, 1 [*]km surface mass balance product, evaluated against in situ and remote sensing data, to identify 1997 (± 5 years) as a tipping point for GICs mass balance. That year marks the onset of a rapid deterioration in {{the capacity of the}} GICs firn <b>to</b> <b>refreeze</b> meltwater. Consequently, GICs runoff increases 65 % faster than meltwater production, tripling the post- 1997 mass loss to 36 ± 16 [*]Gt- 1, or ∼ 14 % of the Greenland total. In sharp contrast, the extensive inland firn of the GrIS retains most of its refreezing capacity for now, buffering 22 % of the increased meltwater production.

40|$|Ices, {{including}} water ice, {{prefer to}} recondense onto pre-existing nuclei rather than spontaneously forming grains from {{a cloud of}} vapor. Interestingly, different potential recondensation nuclei have very different propensities to actually nucleate water ice at the temperatures associated with freeze-out in protoplanetary discs. Therefore, if a region in a disc is warmed and then recooled, water vapor should not be expected <b>to</b> <b>refreeze</b> evenly onto all available grains. Instead it will preferentially recondense onto the most favorable grains. When the recooling is slow enough, only the most favorable grains will nucleate ice, allowing them to recondense thick ice mantles. We quantify the conditions for preferential recondensation to rapidly create pebble-sized grains in protoplanetary discs and show that FU Orionis type outbursts have the appropriate cooling rates to drive pebble creation in a band about 5 astronomical units wide outside of the quiescent frost line from approximately Jupiter's orbit to Saturn's (about 4 to 10 au). Those pebbles could be of the appropriate size to proceed to planetesimal formation via the Streaming Instability, or {{to contribute to the}} growth of planetesimals through pebble accretion.

40|$|Results from an ice stress buoy {{deployed}} {{near the}} center of a multi-year floe in the Viscount Melville Sound of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago between 10 October 2010 and 17 August 2011 are presented. The position record indicates the landlocked season was approximately 5 months, from 18 January to 22 June, when the sea ice was fast to Melville Island and Victoria Island. Thermal stresses (ranging from − 84 to 66 kPa) dominate the internal stress record, with only a few dynamic stress events (∼ 50 kPa) recorded before the landlocked season. Intriguingly, the thermal stresses are isotropic before the landlocked ice onset and anisotropic during the landlocked season. Two possible causes to explain anisotropy in thermal stresses are considered: preferred c axis alignment of the ice crystal, and land confinement associated with the nearby coastline. The orientation of the principal stresses indicates that land confinement is responsible for the anisotropy. The stress record also clearly shows the presence of residual compressive stresses at the melt onset, suggesting a viscous creep relaxation time constant of several days. Finally, results show an interesting reversal in the sign of the correlation (from negative to positive) between surface air temperature and thermal stress after the onset of surface melt. We attribute this to the onset of water infiltration within sea ice after which colder night temperature leads <b>to</b> <b>refreezing</b> and compressive stresses.

Several ice types were thus sampled, over a wide geographic area during late summer/early autumn. During the first 2 / 3 of the cruise summer conditions prevailed, with air temperatures around 0 °C and there was extensive snow melt. A common feature of the ice was the occurrence of surface ponds. Another significant feature during this first warm period was that many floes had quasi-continuous horizontal gaps. The underlying ice was often very porous and rotten. By the onset of cold air temperatures in late February the gaps rapidly started <b>to</b> <b>refreeze,</b> and the gap layer was quickly frozen onto {{the underside of the}} overlying ice.

40|$|Accidental {{hypothermia}} and localized cold injuries {{remain a}} significant public health problem. The deleterious effect of cold exposure on human performance and health {{has been documented}} for centuries. Some of the earliest descriptions came from Baron de Larrey, Napoleon’s chief surgeon. During the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 he depicted the mental and physical hardships endured by the French soldiers {{as a result of}} exposure to severe cold. Of note, de Larrey observed that the cold victims placed closest to the fire often died [1]. Frostbite was also a major cause of severe morbidity and tissue loss among French soldiers during the invasion. The danger of repetitive freeze–thaw cycles became evident as the soldiers warmed their feet next to the fire at night only <b>to</b> <b>refreeze</b> again the following day. The resultant increase in tissue loss was erroneously attributed to the excessive speed of recovery next to the fire and massage of the exposed extremity with snow therefore became in vogue as a method of gradual rewarming. The practice was finally abandoned as a therapeutic intervention in 1956 after a report of the successful recovery of a severely hypothermic patient who had frostbite following rapid rewarming [2]. George Washington’s troops suffered heavy casualties during the brutal winter of 1777 to 1778 and some 10 % of his men were ‘‘left to perish by winter’s cold’ ’ [3]. Nearly 200, 000 allied and German troops suffered cold related injuries or deaths during World War II. Cold-related fatalities accounted for 10 % of all deaths among American forces during the Korean War [4].

40|$|A {{recent study}} on cloud {{observations}} reports {{an increase in}} total cloud cover at Faraday/Vernadsky since 1960 in the annual and wintertime data. The aim of this present study is to investigate whether this increase in total cloud cover has influenced the precipitation in this region. For this purpose, precipitation observations at the Antarctic base Faraday/Vernadsky between 1960 and 1999 were analysed. A positive trend, significant at the 5 % level, {{was found in the}} number of precipitation events recorded during winter, showing an increase of 13 events per decade. The annual number of precipitation days has increased by 5. 7 per decade during the period of investigation, with highest increase rates being observed in winter and autumn. The characteristics of these findings confirm that results previously published though trends presented here are ∼ 50 % smaller due to a more thorough data quality control of the observational data. These results indicate that an increase in total cloud cover at Faraday/Vernadsky observed since 1960 in the annual and wintertime data is reflected in higher numbers of precipitation events and days. Analyses of the precipitation type found an increase in the proportion of events of non-frozen precipitation, which is significant (1 % level) on an annual basis as well as in spring and autumn (both significant at 5 % level). This is a clear manifestation of the year round temperature increase observed over the Antarctic Peninsula. The increase in non-frozen precipitation will have reduced the albedo in the region and will thus have contributed to the temperature-albedo feedback. <b>To</b> <b>refreeze</b> rain that is draining through glaciers energy is extracted from the surrounding ice, thereby physically corroding the ice.

40|$|The Helheim glacier in {{south-east}} Greenland faces {{a retreat}} and thinning {{like many other}} Greenland outlet glaciers, but showed two particular huge and fast retreats between 2000 and 2005, coinciding with an acceleration of glacier flow [1]. The estimation of glacier retreat and thinning are established procedures based {{on a variety of}} remote sensing techniques, e. g. SAR interferometry (InSAR) [1]. However, due to densification processes, e. g. refreezing of meltwater, changes in the mass balance cannot be calculated solely from changes in the volume of a glacier derived from interferometric elevation models [2]. A near surface densification related <b>to</b> <b>refreezing</b> of meltwater leads to a reduction in surface elevation, but does not contribute to a mass loss and thus cannot be attributed to a potential sea level rise. Likewise, the measurement of snow accumulation and its spatial distribution is error prone due to the penetration bias of InSAR measurements. While local data of accumulation or densification give precise information [2], satellite based polarimetric and interferometric SAR (Pol-InSAR) data has the potential to assess these changes in the near surface snow and firn layers with a better spatial and temporal coverage. This study investigates X-band (TanDEM-X) Pol-InSAR data in order to retrieve information about the temporal and spatial variations of surface and near- surface parameters of the Helheim glacier.

40|$|Several ways {{in which}} {{solid-state}} deformation could be important {{in the evolution of}} an ice-silicate body are considered. The considerations suggest several scenarios for the evolution of Ganymede and Callisto which might be tested on the basis of Voyager and Galileo results. Several potential sources of heat may have caused extensive melting early in the history of these bodies, including a high initial luminosity of Jupiter, accretional heating, gravitational segregation of ice and silicates in a homogeneously accreted body, and deformation by synchronous rotation. The analysis leads to the conclusion that two mechanisms - diapirism and solid-state convection - could be sufficient to inhibit the development of an excessive liquid water mantle, or <b>to</b> cause <b>refreezing</b> of such a mantle formed prior to steady-state conditions or from other heat sources...|$|R
