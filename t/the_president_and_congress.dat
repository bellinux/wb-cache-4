25|$|Immediately {{upon his}} {{assuming}} office {{he had to}} deal first with some incidents in Chillán, and then with an insurrection in the island of Chiloé that was trying {{to break away from}} the control of the central government and return to the protection of Spain. The rebellion was very brutally suppressed, and 20 people were executed. The problems between <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> that had marked the rule of his predecessor, continued. The federal laws started to cause friction between the new provinces, and the famous highwaymen the Pincheira family, started a new campaign.|$|E
25|$|Concerning Reconstruction, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> {{were deeply}} divided. Johnson, {{even when his}} amnesty policy had come under heavy criticism, had obdurately {{supported}} and continued it. Radical Republicans in Congress, however, came to prefer Stanton's military occupation proposal. The President's support from moderate Republicans dwindled after the gruesome anti-Negro riots in Memphis and New Orleans. The public seemed to be against Johnson as well. In the 1866 congressional elections, Republicans made sweeping gains on their Democratic rivals. In both the House and Senate elections, Republicans gained a two-thirds plurality of the seats. In the new year, some Republicans sought to use their majority to oust Johnson. They presented the Tenure of Office Bill, written with Stanton in mind. The President had long considered dismissing Stanton and replacing him with Maj. Gen. Sherman; the Tenure of Office Bill would have made this illegal without the advice and consent of Congress, which was unlikely to be given for Stanton, who was firmly supported by and cooperating with Radical Republicans. When the bill reached the President's desk, he vetoed it. His veto was overridden the same day.|$|E
25|$|Congressional {{and local}} {{support for the}} {{redevelopment}} of Lafayette Square waned significantly. Over the next few years, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> established several new agencies to supervise the approval, design, and construction of new buildings in the District of Columbia: The Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 (to approve the design of new structures), the Public Buildings Commission in 1916 (to make recommendations regarding the housing of federal agencies and offices), and the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission in 1924 (to oversee planning for the District). In the mid-1910s, Congress appropriated and the government spent $7 million to acquire land on Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th and 15th Streets NW and several blocks south. But no demolition or construction was conducted, and the government merely collected rent from the tenants in the area. In 1924, the Public Buildings Commission recommended that {{a new series of}} federal office buildings be built near the White House. The plan called for a complex of buildings to be built at Murder Bay—a muddy, flood-prone, malaria-ridden, poverty-stricken region lacking in paved roads, sewer system, and running water and almost exclusively home to numerous brothels and an extensive criminal underclass.|$|E

25|$|On March 25, 1965, President Johnson issued Executive Order No. 11210, which {{established}} the Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Temporary Commission {{was charged with}} analyzing the engineering, financial, planning, and other relevant considerations essential to ensuring the adoption {{and implementation of the}} 1964 master plan, as well as recommending appropriate legislation to <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress.</b> The Temporary Commission was also instructed to coordinate its efforts with the National Capital Planning Commission's master plan for the city. The Temporary Commission was an interim measure designed to ensure that no buildings incompatible with the plan were built until legislation regarding the master plan was passed. Although certain aspects of the master plan were controversial among some groups, the District of Columbia enacted zoning changes to permit mixed-used development and buildings which conformed to the Owings plan in April 1965. Construction of the first private building under the master plan, 451 12th Street NW, began in August 1965. Legislation to make the Temporary Commission permanent and give it extensive powers was introduced in October 1965, but strong opposition to the proposed National Plaza emerged and hindered passage of the bill. The size of the plaza remained intact into late 1967, and a large new arts and office building (to be built between 11th and 13th Streets NW on E Street NW) was proposed.|$|E

Eisenhower was also impressed with his [...] "intelligence, dedication, tenacity, and courage to speak his mind."

[...] Herbert Croly, in his biography of Hanna, agreed, and McKinley biographer H.Wayne Morgan also states that Bushnell delayed Hanna's commission for this reason. Hanna biographer William Horner considers this motive possible. [...] In his memoirs, Foraker denied this, stating that Sherman had not resigned from the Senate until the afternoon of March4, 1897 (the date on which <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> were sworn in) so that Sherman could formally introduce Foraker to the Senate. [...] Sherman, according to Foraker, was also unwilling to resign until he had been confirmed as Secretary of State, which {{took place on the}} afternoon of March4. [...] Foraker noted that he had been senator-elect since his selection by the legislature in January 1896 [...] "and there was no vacancy for which Mr. Hanna could be qualified, except only that to be created by the retirement of Mr. Sherman, and Mr. Sherman refused to retire until I was sworn and in my seat".|$|E

Breckinridge was elected chairman, Robert Todd and John Bradford were chosen as vice-chairmen, and Thomas Todd and Thomas Bodley were elected as clerks. Breckinridge authored a tract entitled Remonstrance of the Citizens West of the Mountains to <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> of the United States and may have also written To the Inhabitants of the United States West of the Allegany (sic) and Apalachian (sic) Mountains. He pledged funding to French minister Edmond-Charles Genêt's proposed military operation against Spain, but Genêt was recalled before it could be executed. Although alarmed that frontier settlers might initiate war with Spain, President George Washington made no immediate attempt to obtain use of the Mississippi, which the society maintained was [...] "the natural right of the citizens of this Commonwealth". The resistance of the eastern states, particularly Federalist politicians, caused Breckinridge to reconsider his support of a strong central government.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{method of}} {{management}} at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them do their jobs without interference. He attempted to interpret {{the mandate of the}} OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: [...] "Will it help to win a war; this war?" [...] Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD requested deferments for some 9,725 employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, The New York Times described Bush as [...] "a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1869, Cuban {{nationals}} were in open {{rebellion against}} their mother country Spain, {{due to the}} unpopularity of Spanish rule. American sentiment favored the Cuban rebels and President Grant appeared {{to be on the}} verge of acknowledging Cuban belligerency. Fish, who desired settlement over the Alabama Claims, did not approve of recognizing the Cuban rebels, since Queen Victoria and her government had recognized Confederate belligerency in 1861. Recognizing Cuban belligerency would have jeopardized settlement and arbitration with Great Britain. In February 1870, Senator John Sherman authored a Senate resolution that would have recognized Cuban belligerency. Working behind the scenes Fish counseled Sherman that Cuban recognition would ultimately lead to war with Spain. The resolution went to the House of Representatives and was ready to pass, however, Fish, worked out an agreement with President Grant to send a special message to Congress that urged not to acknowledge the Cuban rebels. On June 13, 1870 the message written by Fish was sent to Congress by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress,</b> after much debate, decided not to recognize Cuban belligerency.
