5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated bin Laden and other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14.

The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was 90 miles southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To provide {{material}} {{foundation for}} the transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) modified by cardiotrophin- 1 (CT- 1) gene {{in the treatment of}} central nervous system injury with the CT- 1 gene modifying NSCs in rats. Methods: The experiment was performed at the Military Key Opened Laboratory, Institute of Battle Surgery, Third Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from June 2002 to June 2003. <b>The</b> embryos <b>NSCs</b> were isolated and cultured from embryo hippocampus and ependyma region in Wistar rats in order to establish the purified recombined adenovirus (rAd) -CT 1 and rAd-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) carrier transfection into <b>NSCs.</b> <b>The</b> condition of growth and living was observed directly under the differential microscope. <b>The</b> <b>NSCs</b> and <b>the</b> special nestin, neurofilament, glial fibriliary acidic protein (GFAP) exogenous Brdu of the differentiation cells of NSCs after inducing and the mixed status of the EGFP were detected with immunocytochemical method and immunofluorescence technique, and the expression of the CT- 1 gene in <b>the</b> <b>NSCs</b> was observed. Results: 1 <b>The</b> <b>NSCs</b> separated from embryo of rats could do many times of passage in vitro. The cell proliferation marker, Brdu mixture verified that <b>the</b> <b>NSCs</b> had <b>the</b> ability of splitting and proliferation. 2 <b>The</b> <b>NSCs</b> marker-nestin, neuron marker-neurofilament and the glial cell marker-GFAP were detected, which indicated that <b>the</b> <b>NSCs</b> had <b>the</b> multipotential differentiation. 3 After the transfection of rAd-CT 1 and rAd-EGFP into <b>NSCs.</b> <b>the</b> CT 1 and the expression of reported gene EGFP in <b>the</b> <b>NSCs</b> continuously increased significantly detected with immunohistochemical method and fluorescent tracer technique. Conclusion: 1 NSCs are isolated and cultured in the experiment successfully, and can perform passage proliferation in vitro in many times and can trans-differentiation into neurons and glial cells. 2 After the transfection of rAd-CT 1 and rAd-EGFP into <b>NSCs,</b> <b>the</b> exogenous CT- 1 gene and EGFP can express stablely in NSCs...|$|R

5|$|The {{signature}} of the military-appointed civilian Chief of State Phan Khắc Sửu was required to pass the ruling, but Sửu referred the matter to the High National Council (HNC), a junta-appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. This was speculated to be because many HNC members were old, and did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors. On 19 December, the generals dissolved the HNC. The operation was commanded by Thi — who had traveled into Saigon from I Corps — and Kỳ. The national police, which was under the control and command of the military, moved through the streets before dawn, arresting five HNC members and other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to military rule.

We found astrocytes with single cilia (NSCs, correspond to B cells) and neuroblasts (A cells). We also observed mitotic cells, ependymal cells, displaced ependymal cells, and mature astrocytes.
