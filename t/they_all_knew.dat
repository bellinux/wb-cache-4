25|$|Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, {{treasurer}} of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied {{to testify in}} the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind. He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, {{in order to maintain}} their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, because <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story.|$|E
500|$|When Selman returned, Scully scolded him {{and told}} him that he had to {{apologize}} to the mayor of East St. Louis, who, unbeknownst to Selman, was portrayed by Marc Wilmore. Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy The PJ's, had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St. Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an [...] "Oscar-worthy performance". [...] "I was terrified", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, [...] " [...] a twenty-minute discussion in which [...] said that [...] children were teased at school , and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..." [...] According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, [...] "Well, everyone participates, you know [...] Have you never heard of the word 'collaboration'?" [...] Selman realized the joke when he turned around and saw [...] "all the other writers laughing". [...] "I was so relieved", he said, [...] "I was soaked with sweat [...] I had betrayed my fellow writers, tried to get them in trouble, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> me for the turn-coat that I was." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{academics}} like Peter Leeson and Marcus Rediker argue, {{a pirate}} was {{more often than}} not someone from a previous seagoing occupation. They were merchant seamen, sailors in the royal navy, and privateers, all of whom would form into a pirate crew. They were not upper class, but the [...] "dregs of society." [...] George Choundas argues in his book Pirate Primer that there was in fact a pirate language, but it was simply accents and the way of speech to which men of the seas were accustomed. They came from different ethnic backgrounds or political units, so pirate speech was simply the way these men could communicate; and what <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> was the language of the seas. It was the nautical speech of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
2500|$|In 1625–1626, she {{petitioned the}} Spanish Crown for {{financial}} reward for her {{services as a}} soldier in the New World. She did this in her relación de méritos y servicios (Account of Merits and Services). In addition to seeking reward for her time at war, she also sought compensation for money she lost while spent traveling to Rome. This document includes accounts from [...] "witnesses" [...] or others who knew Erauso. However, many of the accounts are contradictory in nature and some do not {{know what to make of}} Erauso's predicament. The reason that their accounts are different is for a few reasons. Firstly, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> Erauso by different names and different accomplishments. They may have known Alonso Díaz de Guzmán, the name Erauso used while dressing as a man, but they did not know Catalina.|$|E
2500|$|Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. {{has stayed}} {{on par with}} having its {{landmark}} celebrations coincide with major historical events in the United States. The Sorority's Golden [...] Anniversary was no exception. The celebration occurred in 1963, {{the same year as}} the infamous March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Delta members vowed commitment to, and participation in the march, and came out in very large numbers. In addition Delta Sigma Theta 10th National President Dorothy Height, {{the driving force behind the}} march, was the only woman to sit on the Speakers' Platform. [...] 1963 also marked the Centennial Anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. The Golden Anniversary Celebration was not about resting on the laurels and past accomplishments of Delta Sigma Theta, for <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> there was much work to be done. The Golden Anniversary Celebration was, however, about [...] "New Beginnings" [...] which is why the theme [...] "The Past is Prologue" [...] was chosen.|$|E

2500|$|Polis {{initially}} {{spoke to}} both McKean and Brian Froud, the concept artist for Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal. The initial {{intention was to}} have McKean direct the film with Froud doing the designs, but Polis stated that it [...] "made more sense" [...] to have McKean do the designs seeing as {{he was the one}} directing the film. Since they had a tight budget, McKean designed creatures who were comparatively simple. He assigned entire sequences rather than tiny pieces to individual artists, so that the young professionals working on the film would have the creative opportunity to make part of it their own. He worked with them very closely in a single room. About the animators, he said that, [...] "All but two were straight from art school and almost all from Bournemouth. We took half the class. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> each other already." [...] McKean says that one example of the spirit of the film is that they only had one peach during the filming of the scene where Valentine eats the future fruit. Artist Ian Miller also contributed to the designs of trees and certain other objects in the film, and also provided some of the illustrations pinned to Helena's bedroom wall.|$|E
