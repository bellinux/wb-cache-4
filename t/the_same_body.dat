5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates {{is in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> size.|$|E
5|$|Consumer {{interest}} for {{production of the}} W427 actually began with the still-born HRT 427 Coupe of 2002, based on the Holden Monaro. The original W427 concept car was produced in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> colour as the very first HSV model, the VL Commodore SS Group A SV.|$|E

50|$|In 2003 Bletchley RUFC {{were the}} first sports {{organisation}} in Milton Keynes/North Bucks to gain the Rugby Football Union 'Seal of Approval' and Sport England Clubmark. In 2006 the club gained Stage 2 accreditation from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{philosophical}} concept of eternal recurrence was addressed by Arthur Schopenhauer. It is a purely physical concept, involving no supernatural reincarnation, but {{the return of}} beings in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bodies.</b> Time is viewed as being not linear but cyclical.|$|R
5|$|The M9 Half-track was a {{half-track}} {{produced by}} International Harvester in the United States in World War II for lend-lease supply to Allies. It {{was designed to}} provide a similar vehicle to the M2 Half Track Car. It had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> and chassis as the M5 Half-track (also built by International Harvester for lend-lease) but had the same stowage and radio fit as the M2 Half Track.|$|E
5|$|The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (WCPAEB) was an American {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, {{and at times}} sinister, atmosphere, and contained material that was bluntly political, childlike, and bizarre. Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, the group, at times, resembled a traditional Byrds-esque folk rock ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> of work, recorded avant-garde music marked by multi-layered vocal harmonies.|$|E
5|$|After Edmund Halley {{demonstrated}} that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that comet became known as Halley's Comet. Similarly, {{the second and third}} known periodic comets, Encke's Comet and Biela's Comet, were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their appearance.|$|E

5|$|Daspletosaurus shared <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> form {{as other}} tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, {{which ended in}} four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|E
5|$|The Narrator {{complains}} to Tyler about Tyler excluding {{him from}} the newer manifestation of the Fight Club organization Project Mayhem. Soon after, Tyler leaves the house without notice. When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries {{to shut down the}} project. Seeking Tyler, he follows evidence of Tyler's national travels. In one city, a Project Mayhem member greets the Narrator as Tyler Durden. The Narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. Tyler suddenly appears in his hotel room, and reveals that they are dissociated personalities in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body.</b> When the Narrator has believed himself to be asleep, Tyler has been controlling his body and traveling to different locations.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
50|$|Differences in BMR {{have been}} {{observed}} when comparing subjects with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lean <b>body</b> mass. In one study, when comparing individuals with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lean <b>body</b> mass, <b>the</b> top 5% of BMRs are 28-32% higher than the lowest 5% BMR. Additionally, this study reports a case where two individuals with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lean <b>body</b> mass of 43 kg had BMRs of 1075 kcal/day (4.5 MJ/day) and 1790 kcal/day (7.5 MJ/day). This difference of 715 kcal/day (67%) is equivalent {{to one of the}} individuals completing a 10 kilometer run every day. However, this study did not account for the sex, height, fasting-state, or body fat percentage of the subjects.|$|R

25|$|For <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> region, individuals, {{independently}} of skin colour, {{have the same}} amount of melanocytes (however variation between different body parts is substantial), but organelles which contain pigments, called melanosomes, are smaller and less numerous in light-skinned humans.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have pointed out}} a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism. According to Aristotle, a living thing's matter is its body, which needs a soul {{in order to be}} alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> after death. However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> after death. Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive. But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.|$|E
50|$|Loop {{splitting}}: Loop splitting {{attempts to}} simplify a loop or eliminate dependencies by breaking it into multiple loops which have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bodies</b> but iterate over different contiguous {{portions of the}} index range. A useful special case is loop peeling, which can simplify a loop with a problematic first iteration by performing that iteration separately before entering the loop.|$|R

25|$|Secretarybirds have unusually {{long legs}} (nearly {{twice as long}} as other ground birds of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> mass), which is thought to be an {{adaptation}} for the bird’s unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponent}} in the denominator of {{the formula}} for BMI is arbitrary. The BMI depends upon weight and the square of height. Since mass increases to the 3rd power of linear dimensions, taller individuals with exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> shape and relative composition have a larger BMI.|$|E
50|$|A {{river of}} genes may fork into two branches, mostly {{due to the}} {{geographical}} separation between two populations of organisms. Because genes in the two branches never share <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bodies,</b> they may drift apart until genes from the two branches become incompatible. Organisms created by these two branches (or two rivers) will form separate, non-interbreeding species, completing the process of speciation.|$|R

25|$|Compared with placental mammals or plesiosaurs, {{ichthyosaur}} fetuses {{tend to be}} {{very small}} and their number per litter is often high. In one female of Stenopterygius seven have been identified, in another eleven. The fetuses have at most a quarter of the length of the mother animal. The juveniles have about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>body</b> proportions as adult individuals. The main ontogenetical changes during growth consist in the fusion and greater robustness of the skeletal elements.|$|E
