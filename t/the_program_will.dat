5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>will</b> continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>will</b> end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{organization}} in Central California and the group in Northern California continue to develop and present summer camps for youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>will</b> observe its 60th anniversary in 2018. Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 420 participants in 2015, including 33 youth from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, up from 70 in 2006. The group sponsored by the White Stag Association has attracted between 40 and 83 campers from 2010 to 2014. The two programs have operated continuously since the program's founding entirely on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> <b>will</b> be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E

5|$|They {{awake in}} Dr. Noah's lair at the {{pinnacle}} of Mount Everest. Noah (Sisko) enters and gives a monologue about how he will destroy the world, and shows a big red button he will push to do it. He has Bashir and Garak taken below ground, where they are handcuffed to a laser. As the time ticks down before the laser is activated, Bare performs a final check of the laser. Bashir flirts for her, and she slips him a key and hurries out. Bashir unlocks himself and Garak, who protests that it is too dangerous to continue as the safeties are turned off in the program which could result in their deaths. Garak is about to close the program and kill the other crew members when Bashir shoots him, grazing him with a bullet. Garak is shocked, but impressed and agrees to continue the programme. Bashir is concerned as he knows <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>will</b> end with either the death of Professor Bare or Colonel Komananov following the defeat of Noah.|$|E

25|$|When a {{fraction}} A1, B1 and/or U1 {{in the first}} season differs from fractions are A2, B2 and/or U2 in the second season, because the irrigation regimes in the seasons differ, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>will</b> detect that a certain rotation occurs.

25|$|In addition, {{the length}} of time {{developers}} receive incentives was increased from 25 years to 35 years, with the requirement to maintain affordable rents increased to 40 years.

50|$|A common {{method to}} {{implement}} privilege separation {{is to have}} a computer program fork into two processes. <b>The</b> main <b>program</b> drops privileges, and <b>the</b> smaller <b>program</b> keeps privileges in order to perform a certain task.

Thus, any successful attack against <b>the</b> larger <b>program</b> <b>will</b> gain minimal access, even though <b>the</b> pair of <b>programs</b> <b>will</b> be capable of performing privileged operations.|$|R
