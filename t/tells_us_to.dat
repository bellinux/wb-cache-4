25|$|One of the {{problems}} with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on Bayes factors and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, Variational Bayesian methods, false discovery rate, and Laplace's method are used. Many artificial intelligence researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on Occam Learning or more generally on the Free energy principle.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> look at another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It {{is easy to see}} that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E

2500|$|Karaite Jews and Israelite Samaritans begin {{counting}} the Omer {{on the day}} after the weekly Sabbath during the Feast of Unleavened Bread – Passover, rather than {{on the second day of}} Passover (the 16th of Nisan). There are several reasons for this. On the one hand, Shavuot is the only holiday for which the date is not expressly given in the Torah. Instead, the Torah <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> determine the date of Shavuot by counting 50 days from the [...] "morrow after the Sabbath" [...] until the [...] "morrow after the 7th Sabbath" [...] (Leviticus 23:15–16).|$|E
2500|$|The match {{itself was}} a scrappy affair that lacked the drama {{of many of the}} {{previous}} encounters, with England sneaking a 1–0 win thanks to a second-half header by striker Alan Shearer.

2500|$|Barsine was a noble Persian, {{daughter}} of Artabazus, and wife of Memnon. After Memnon's death, several ancient historians have written {{of a love}} affair between her and Alexander. Plutarch writes, [...] "At any rate Alexander, so it seems, thought it more worthy of a king to subdue his own passions than to conquer his enemies, and so he never came near these women, nor did he associate with any other before his marriage, with the exception only of Barsine. This woman, the widow of Memnon, the Greek mercenary commander, was captured at Damascus. She had received a Greek education, was of a gentle disposition, and could claim royal descent, since her father was Artabazus who had married one of the Persian kings daughters. These qualities made Alexander the more willing he was encouraged by Parmenio, so Aristobulus <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> form an attachment to a woman of such beauty and noble lineage." [...] In addition Justin writes, [...] "As he afterwards contemplated the wealth and display of Darius, he was seized with admiration of such magnificence. Hence {{it was that he}} first began to indulge in luxurious and splendid banquets, {{and fell in love with}} his captive Barsine for her beauty, by whom he had afterwards a son that he called Heracles." ...|$|E

Well, Jesus <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine."

2500|$|Pickler's {{mother was}} {{repeatedly}} charged with writing bad checks and {{was convicted in}} 1988 for passing a forged prescription for Valium at the Albemarle Wal-Mart, where she worked. Pickler's parents split up the day after her second birthday; a year later, in July 1989, her mother vanished. During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, [...] northeast of Charlotte. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with The Observer, Pickler said: [...] "She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me." [...] In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said {{that her mother had}} moved to Union County with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again, and Pickler has not heard from her since.
