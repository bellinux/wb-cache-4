5|$|Tourism is Varanasi's {{second most}} {{important}} industry. Over 3 million domestic and 200,000 foreign tourists visit annually (in 2005 and 2010, respectively), most commonly for religious purposes. Most domestic <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> from Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, {{while the majority of}} foreign <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> from Sri Lanka and Japan. The peak tourist season falls between October and March. In total, there are around 12,000 beds available in the city, of which about one half are in inexpensive budget hotels and one third in dharamsalas. Overall, Varanasi's tourist infrastructure is not well developed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tourists</b> <b>are</b> not as {{attracted}} to the island for its mangroves as for the coconut trees which line its beaches, as featured on many of Carabane's postcards. These palm trees are a valued resource on the island.|$|E
5|$|Treks: <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> {{not allowed}} to walk inside the park, but only to go {{trekking}} around the park {{in the company of}} a guide. The winter season is cold, so tourists should make proper arrangements for their clothing, if they are traveling in the winter season.|$|E

5|$|Because the A82 is a main through route, <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> {{suggested}} {{to use the}} older Military Road instead, {{so as to avoid}} the coach and HGV traffic. Cyclists and walkers can use the Great Glen Way between Fort Wiilam and Inverness. This is part of National Cycle Route 78 (The Caledonia Way) from Campbeltown to Inverness.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island {{is known}} for its geology, birds, plants, and marine life. Popular tourist {{activities}} include scuba diving, birdwatching, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, and fishing. To relieve pressure on the small island environment only 400 <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> permitted at any one time. The island is reached by plane from Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport in less than two hours. The Permanent Park Preserve declared in 1981 has similar management guidelines to a National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Castle {{is open to}} {{tourists}} only via guided tours. These occur daily outside of term time, but are more restricted during the term due to potential conflicts with {{the running of the}} college. Furthermore, events in the university timetable may result in their cancellation. <b>Tourists</b> <b>are</b> not otherwise permitted entry to the college or any common areas. There is relatively little conflict between students and tourists, with many of the guided tours done by students themselves.|$|E

5|$|Those {{who have}} hard {{currency}} can easily buy imported cigarettes from hard currency shops, although these will also stock the best domestic brands (such as Pak Ma, comparable in quality to makhorka) to convince tourists {{of the quality}} of North Korean tobacco.

5|$|While {{there are}} several caves inside the park, the most visited by <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> Gruta de los Guácharos (Oilbird Cave), Gruta Blanca (White Cave), and Gruta del Murciélago (Bats' Cave).

5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{industry}} is subdivided into gambling, hospitality, restaurants, beach bars and cafés. National visitors are prevalent and from diverse localities. In 1876, Ramalho Ortigão noticed that Póvoa was {{very popular in}} all social ranks in Northern Portugal. In the contemporary period, the construction of motorways negatively affected overnight stays in local hotels. This has been leveled by a noticeable attraction of Portuguese living abroad and foreign tourists {{and the number of}} hotel rooms in 2014 increased to 1.774. Most of those <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> French or from diverse countries in Northern Europe. International tourists sleeping in the city's hotels represented 35.1% of guests in 2013, up from 30.3% in 2001. Informal local accommodation, especially typical homes in rua Latino Coelho, is a popular alternative for long stays. Póvoa de Varzim has the longest overnight stays for foreign tourists in Metropolitan Porto who stay, on average, 3 days.|$|E
