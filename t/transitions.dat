5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic <b>transitions</b> from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The <b>transitions</b> are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped <b>transitions</b> identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E

5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase <b>transitions</b> and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase <b>transitions,</b> the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase <b>transitions,</b> such as key liquid crystal <b>transitions.</b>|$|E

Although the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act emphasizes the importance of parental participation in the <b>transition</b> process, parents report that they are not knowledgeable about the <b>transition</b> process or options for post school services. Due to the complex needs of individuals with disabilities and intricate post-school agency systems, parental understanding about the <b>transition</b> process and agency systems is particularly important for parents of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Unfortunately, parental knowledge of the <b>transition</b> process and its effect on agency usage and <b>transition</b> outcomes is not well documented. Therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} understand how parental knowledge of the <b>transition</b> process and human service agencies is related to agency usage and <b>transition</b> outcomes. This study used the Taxonomy for <b>Transition</b> Programming as a guide to develop a questionnaire for parents of children with an intellectual disability who had graduated from a Texas high school. The survey examined parent?s views about <b>transition</b> experiences, agency experiences, <b>transition</b> outcomes, and opinions about the <b>transition</b> process. It was hypothesized that family knowledge about <b>transition</b> and human service agencies that was developed within the <b>transition</b> process would be positively related to agency usage, <b>transition</b> outcomes, and parental opinions about the <b>transition</b> process.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} primary to secondary <b>transition</b> for two key groups of students within Catholic Colleges in Tasmania. The first group was students from small rural schools <b>transitioning</b> to larger urban schools. The second group was students <b>transitioning</b> within schools that have a Preparatory to Year 10 (or Year 12) structure. New instruments: the Early <b>Transition</b> Questionnaire, the Late <b>Transition</b> Questionnaire and the Parent Questionnaire, were devised to gather data about students’ expectations and experiences of the <b>transition</b> process, as well as parents’ perspectives about <b>transition.</b> Research questions were answered through numerous statistical analyses of questionnaire data. Contingency Table Analysis, Independent-samples t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to investigate the differences between rural and urban students, and internal and external <b>transitioning</b> students’ expectations and realities of <b>transition.</b> Paired-samples t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were conducted to examine the difference between expectation and reality of <b>transition</b> for rural and internal <b>transitioning</b> students. Statistically significant differences were confirmed by the calculation of effect size. For the Early <b>Transition</b> Questionnaire {{the sample consisted of}} 898 students, made up of rural (n= 64) and urban (n= 834) students, and internal (n= 203) and external (n= 695) <b>transitioning</b> students. The Late <b>Transition</b> Questionnaire sample consisted of 722 participants, made up of rural (n= 49) and urban (n= 673) students, and internal (n= 189) and external (n= 533) <b>transitioning</b> students. Finally, the sample of the Parent Questionnaire consisted of 461 parents of rural (n= 28) and urban (n= 433) <b>transitioning</b> students, and internal <b>transitioning</b> (n= 111) and external <b>transitioning</b> (n = 350) students. Seven Catholic secondary schools across Tasmania were involved in the study, four of which have a Preparatory to Year 10 (or Year 12) structure. Sizeable differences were found between rural and internal <b>transitioning</b> students’ expectations and realities of <b>transition</b> across the social, academic and organisational dimensions, parental influence and <b>transition</b> programs scales. Results suggest the existing <b>transition</b> programs help ease rural and internal <b>transitioning</b> students’ organisational and social dimension concerns, but greater attention should be given to the academic dimension of <b>transition.</b> This study presents three distinctive contributions {{to the understanding of the}} primary to secondary <b>transition</b> for rural and internal <b>transitioning</b> students. Firstly, existing <b>transition</b> programs need to incorporate more strategies that meet the academic needs of <b>transitioning</b> students. Secondly, internal <b>transitioning</b> students have a different set of <b>transitioning</b> needs and programs should be designed to cater for these students.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} further {{development}} of smooth <b>transition</b> regression models and their applications in finance. Smooth <b>transition</b> regression models are used to model nonlinearity of regime-switching type in empirical applications. Usually, smooth <b>transition</b> regression models are used with univariate <b>transition</b> functions, that is, a single <b>transition</b> variable is supposed to govern the <b>transition</b> between regimes. With multivariate <b>transition</b> functions, the <b>transition</b> between regimes can be driven {{by more than one}} variable, each weighted by its estimated impact on the <b>transition</b> process. The first paper of the thesis transfers the use of multivariate <b>transition</b> functions to the panel smooth <b>transition</b> regression model and uses oil price forecast as an empirical application. Another commonly found restriction is that smooth <b>transition</b> regression models are applied with a single homogeneous <b>transition</b> function. If a model with more than one regime-switching variable is used, the <b>transition</b> between regimes can be either estimated with a single <b>transition</b> function for all regime-switching variables (homogeneous model) or with different <b>transition</b> functions (heterogeneous model) for each regime-switching variable. The second paper of the thesis proposes the use of panel smooth <b>transition</b> regression models with heterogeneous and multivariate <b>transition</b> functions. Credit default swap pricing is used as an empirical application. The previously introduced generalization of the smooth <b>transition</b> regression framework with heterogeneous <b>transition</b> functions increases the flexibility of the model. Using the heterogeneous model instead of the homogeneous one is the cautionary choice, because estimating the homogeneous model when a heterogeneous specification is appropriate generally leads to biased parameters. Therefore, the third paper of the thesis proposes a test for the decision between homogeneous and heterogeneous <b>transition</b> functions. Empirical size and power of the test are examined by a Monte-Carlo simulation...|$|R

40|$|The <b>transition</b> {{crossing}} is {{space charge}} dominated in the Fermilab Booster. Since the longitudinal space charge forces are defocusing below <b>transition</b> and focusing above <b>transition,</b> they generate the mismatch at <b>transition,</b> which causes the longitudinal emittance growth above <b>transition.</b> It's proved by numerical simulation that such mismatch can be partially compensated {{by a particular}} radial motion at <b>transition,</b> which is operationally favored by the high intensity beam. The <b>transition</b> crossing in Booster is space charge dominated. Usually, the nonlinear chromatic effect can cause the emittance growth during <b>transition</b> because particles with different energies cross <b>transition</b> at different times. The <b>transition</b> time is set by the synchronous particle; below <b>transition,</b> particles with positive energies relative to the synchronous particle become unstable since {{they are in the}} wrong phase, and above <b>transition,</b> particles with negative energies are unstable.
