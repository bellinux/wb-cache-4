5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in the second or <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>March.</b> Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
40|$|General Description: A showy, yellow-flowered {{perennial}} {{that grows}} 2 - 8 inches in height. Flowers {{occur at the}} ends of the tallest stems. Leaves occur along the flower-stalk as well as on shorter vegetative stems which originate {{at the base of the}} plant. The leaves are cut or incised into 3 distinct leaflets. The most remote portions of the leaflets are linear in shape. Flower and vegetative stems grow out of a tight cluster of shoots along the base of the ground. Petals are 3 / 8 to 5 / 8 inch in length. Mature achenes are not bristly, spiny or papillate; they are only moderately compressed. Identification Tips: R. reconditus does not appear to co-occur with R. glaberrimus, the species with which it is most closely allied, although both taxa occur in Klickitat and Wasco counties. R. reconditus may be easily distinguished by its triternately dissected leaves; the leaves of R. glaberrimus are only shallowly lobed. Phenology: Leaves emerge by the initiation of flowering in the first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>March.</b> Peak anthesis typically occurs during the second and <b>third</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>March.</b> Immature fruits are formed by late March and mature fruits have begun dispersing by mid-April.

25|$|To {{be certain}} of a victory, Abu Bakr made two {{decisions}} concerning the attack on Persia: first, the invading army would consist entirely of volunteers; and second, to put {{in command of the}} army his best general: Khalid ibn al-Walid. After defeating the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama, Khalid was still at Al-Yamama when Abu Bakr sent him orders to invade the Sassanid Empire. Making Al-Hirah the objective of Khalid, Abu Bakr sent reinforcements and ordered the tribal chiefs of north eastern Arabia, Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha, Mazhur bin Adi, Harmala and Sulma to operate under the command of Khalid along with their men. Around the <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>March</b> 633 (first week of Muharram 12th Hijrah) Khalid set out from Al-Yamama with an army of 10,000. The tribal chiefs, with 2,000 warriors each, joined Khalid; so he entered the Persian Empire with 18,000 troops.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 In 1970, the Pacific Northwest (PNW) {{produced}} approximately 145, 332, 000 {{bushels of}} wheat (all types) {{with an average}} harvest value of over 220, 000, 000. White wheat comprised about 126, 234, 000 bushels of that total, about 87 percent. In recent years the financial circumstances, for several reasons, have deteriorated for many farmers and grain handlers in the PNW. The reduced incomes have stimulated renewed exploration for some means of increasing revenues and/or stabilizing net prices received. The effective marketing of wheat {{in other areas of}} the U. S. involves the use of wheat futures markets. PNW producers and handlers of White wheat have not generally had this opportunity because the White wheat is not deliverable on existing futures contracts. Consequently, it is desirable to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing existing wheat futures contracts in spite of nondelivery. If the White wheat price patterns move in favorable relation to the price of deliverable wheats, then nondelivery may not preclude effective hedging. A one cent per bushel gain by successful hedging would add about 1. 3 million dollars annually to producer income for White wheat in the PNW. Results for a ten year period indicate there are certain hedging strategies which appear to be profitable to PNW White wheat traders. The December wheat futures cortract prcvids long term gross benefits (not considering transaction costs or holding costs) of 5 to 7 cents per bushel on short hedges opened between the first week in March and the <b>third</b> <b>week</b> in March, and closed in the second or <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> May. Short hedge benefits for March futures averaged about 7 to 9 cents per bushel with opening dates between the first and <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> September and closing dates between the <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> January and the first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>March.</b> Corresponding results for short hedges with May futures are 12. 5 to 14. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates between the last <b>week</b> <b>of</b> July and the last <b>week</b> <b>of</b> September and closing dates between the last <b>week</b> <b>of</b> April and the second <b>week</b> <b>of</b> May; and for the July and September futures, 8. 5 to 10. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates from the second <b>week</b> <b>of</b> October to the second <b>week</b> <b>of</b> November and closing dates between the second and <b>third</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> May. The optimum short hedges, all of which fall within the above indicated dates, were profitable nine out of ten years for May futures; eight out of ten years for December, July and September contracts, and seven out of ten years for March contracts. Long hedging strategies were not found to be as frequently profitable [...] eight out of ten years for July contracts; seven out of ten years for May contracts; six out of ten years for December and March contracts and five out of ten years for September contracts. Optimum long hedges using December futures provided 8. 7 to 10. 7 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and <b>third</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> May and closing dates between the first <b>week</b> <b>of</b> July and the <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> September; for <b>March</b> futures, 10 to 12 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and <b>third</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> May and closing dates between the first and <b>third</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> September; for May futures, 2. 5 to 3. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and fourth <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> June and closing dates between the second <b>week</b> <b>of</b> August and the <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> September; for July futures, 7. 5 to 9. 5 cents per bushel with opening dates between the second and <b>third</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> May and closing dates between the first and second <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> July; and for September contracts, 9. 3 to 11. 3 cents per bushel with opening dates in the second and <b>third</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> May and closing dates in the second <b>week</b> <b>of</b> September. In several instances, profits or losses were generated in both the cash and futures transactions, indicating that while several of the optimum strategies did generate overall profitable results, the hedge would really need to be considered a "speculative hedge" rather than a "traditional hedge" wherein cash and futures losses and gains are generally offsetting to at least some extent...|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, any {{producer}} of Muscadet wine could use the phrase sur lie on their wine labels regardless {{of the length of}} time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub-appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the <b>third</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> <b>March</b> following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more full-bodied style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees and not go through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or type of vessel that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just that done in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel fermentation tanks are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly.|$|E

According to Chris Turner, a Canadian journalist and writer of the book Planet Simpson, the newsgroup was among the most trafficked newsgroups of the early 1990s. In that period it became a popular community on the Internet. According to Brian Reid, a computer scientist who has been tracking newsgroup traffic since 1985, alt.tv.simpsons was the most popular television newsgroup in May 1994, ahead of a discussion newsgroups about general television newsgroup (rec.arts.tv), Monty Python (alt.fan.monty-python), the Late Show with David Letterman (alt.fan.letterman) and soap operas (rec.arts.tv.soaps).

This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, Simpsons creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other showrunners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, [...] "Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic noggins together".
