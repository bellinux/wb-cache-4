5|$|Alligator and {{crocodile}} farming began {{because of}} demand for their hides, but now nearly {{all parts of the}} animal are put to use. The side and belly skin make the best leather, the meat is eaten, <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> bladders are valued in East Asia, and the heads are sometimes made into ornaments. In traditional Chinese medicine, alligator meat is said to cure the common cold and prevent cancer, while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5â€“7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has four}} pairs of teats, {{including}} {{one on the}} chest and three on the belly, and <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> bladder is absent, both important characters of Oryzomyini. As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, Pseudoryzomys has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. In the cartilaginous part of the baculum, the central digit is smaller than those at the sides.|$|E
50|$|Cairbre and Eogan, sons of Mag Tigernain, made an {{expedition}} against <b>the</b> <b>Galls</b> {{and one of}} their own men turned traitor and sold them to <b>the</b> <b>Galls</b> for pelf. <b>The</b> <b>Galls</b> gathered round them, killed twenty-five of them, including the two sons of Mag Tigernain, and cut off their heads.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>galls</b> of <b>the</b> rose <b>gall</b> wasp (Diplolepis rosae) {{are also}} {{distinctive}} and {{are known as}} bedeguars or robin's pincushions. These are found on the shoots of dog roses and have a length of up to 5 cm with red, long-haired outgrowths. Inside <b>the</b> <b>galls</b> are several chambers, which may be occupied by larvae.|$|R
50|$|The {{host species}} are golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) and Acacia rivalis. The eggs are laid by {{short-lived}} adult wasps into buds of flower {{heads in the}} summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of <b>the</b> grape-like <b>galls</b> and prevent flower development. <b>The</b> <b>galls</b> can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. It has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>galls</b> also reduce <b>the</b> resilience of the host plants by absorbing nutrients and hence starving them. <b>The</b> <b>galls</b> are up to 3 cm in diameter and contain several grubs.|$|R
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are almost}} {{never seen in}} the open, instead resting motionless on the sea floor buried under {{a thin layer of}} sediment that disguises their outlines. At night some individuals remain motionless, waiting for prey, while others may be encountered on the bottom unburied or actively swimming. Large sharks, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume Pacific angelsharks. Known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, which infests the skin, the myxosporidian Chloromyxum levigatum, which infests <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> bladder, and the tapeworm Paraberrapex manifestus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. The leech Branchellion lobata may be attached around this shark's cloaca, inside the intestine, and even inside the uterus and on developing embryos.|$|E
5|$|The stomach has the {{characteristic}} pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular); {{it is not}} split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (antrum) is covered by a glandular epithelium. <b>The</b> <b>gall</b> bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal recessive mutation. At about 50%, hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E
50|$|Because crab size {{is related}} to gall size, {{it is likely that}} the crabs form <b>the</b> <b>galls,</b> rather than living {{randomly}} in a dwelling within a coral. Related groups of gall crab taxa share a similar gall type, suggesting that the crabs influence the morphology of <b>the</b> <b>galls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>galls</b> of Quercus infectoria {{have also}} been {{pharmacologically}} documented to possess astringent, antidiabetic, antitremorine, local anaesthetic, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal [...] and anti-inflammatory [...] activities. The main constituents found in <b>the</b> <b>galls</b> of Quercus infectoria are tannin (50-70%) and small amount of free gallic acid and ellagic acid.|$|R
50|$|The hickory leaf stem gall {{phylloxera}} (Phylloxera caryaecaulis) {{also uses}} the hickory tree {{as a food}} source. Phylloxeridae are related to aphids and have a similarly complex life cycle. Eggs hatch in early spring and <b>the</b> <b>galls</b> quickly form around the developing insects. Phylloxera galls may damage weakened or stressed hickories, but are generally harmless. Deformed leaves and twigs can rain down from the tree in the spring as squirrels break off infected tissue and eat <b>the</b> <b>galls,</b> possibly for <b>the</b> protein content or because <b>the</b> <b>galls</b> are fleshy and tasty to the squirrels. <b>The</b> pecan <b>gall</b> curculio (Conotrachelus elegans) is a true weevil species also found feeding on <b>galls</b> of <b>the</b> hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera.|$|R
25|$|The {{lifecycle}} of sugarbeet root aphids involves {{primary and}} secondary host plants. Galls are formed on the primary host, cottonwood, in the spring by the stem mother. Her wingless offspring, called apterae, feed on <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> until giving rise to winged individuals called alatae. These alatae break out of <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> and colonize the roots of their secondary hosts, sugarbeet.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gall</b> {{induced by}} D. mayri differs in being more sparsely covered in short, {{unbranched}} filaments and the galls usually develop on the twigs.|$|E
25|$|In the spring, {{a female}} nymph (also {{known as a}} stem mother) emerges from an {{overwintering}} egg and initiates a gall {{on one of the}} leaves of the Populus tree. <b>The</b> <b>gall</b> forms around the stem mother, who begins to reproduce parthenogenically while feeding on the leaf's phloem sap. Each stem mother is capable of creating up to 300 progeny per gall. <b>The</b> <b>gall</b> occupants develop wings {{in the middle of the}} summer and disperse from <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> to deposit their larvae in the ground. These larvae colonize and feed on the roots of nearby Chenopodiaceae plants for the rest of the summer. In the summer, they form alate migrants that fly back to the Populus tree and asexually produce sexual males and females whose sole purpose is to mate, as they lack mouthparts to feed. The product of sexual reproduction is a single egg in each female which is deposited in the tree's bark and left to overwinter.|$|E

50|$|The female lays {{eggs in the}} buds of {{chestnut}} trees, sometimes producing over 100 eggs. The wasp is thelytokous, producing fertile eggs by parthenogenesis, without fertilization by a male. Oviposition {{occurs in}} the summer. Larvae hatch from the eggs but do not begin growing immediately. Their growth begins the following spring, when the tree buds begin to develop. At this time, the larvae induce <b>the</b> formation of <b>galls</b> on <b>the</b> tree. <b>The</b> <b>galls</b> are green or pinkish and up to 2 centimeters wide. The larvae develop inside <b>the</b> protective <b>gall</b> structures and emerge from them as adults. <b>The</b> <b>galls</b> dry out and become woody. <b>The</b> <b>galls</b> can be very damaging to the tree. They occur on the new growth of the tree, disrupting the fruiting process, and can reduce a tree's yield up to 70%. They are even known to kill trees.|$|R

25|$|Damage to crops {{is perhaps}} the most costly {{economic}} effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives (Tetranychoidea), earth mites (Penthaleidae), thread-footed mites (Tarsonemidae) and <b>the</b> <b>gall</b> and rust mites (Eriophyidae). The honey bee parasite Varroa destructor has caused large scale die-offs of commercial pollinating populations.|$|E
50|$|These wasps form an {{important}} role in the ecosystem, with more than 20 known species that are parasitoids, inquilines, and hyperparasites that live on its life cycle, while <b>the</b> <b>galls</b> form a persistent shelter for various forms of fungi as well as many other insects. Several birds are also known to feed from <b>the</b> <b>galls</b> and their inhabitants.|$|R

50|$|The larvae feed on Chromolaena odorata. First instar larvae mine young {{stems and}} shoots of their host plant, {{causing it to}} produce a <b>gall.</b> <b>The</b> later instars are stem borers, {{primarily}} within <b>the</b> <b>galls.</b> There are probably five larval instars.
