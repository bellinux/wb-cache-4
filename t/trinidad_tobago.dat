5|$|Before Alma made landfall, gale {{warnings}} and a hurricane watch was issued for <b>Trinidad,</b> <b>Tobago,</b> Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. As Alma progressed westward, gale warnings were also issued for the Paria and Paraguan√° peninsulas of Venezuela, the Guajira Peninsula, and the ABC islands. Initially, the Trinidad and Tobago weather service anticipated Alma would strike Tobago, {{but as the}} storm approached, the trajectory over Trinidad became apparent.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} warning for <b>Trinidad,</b> <b>Tobago,</b> and the Grenadines south of Saint Vincent in the cyclone's first advisory on Hurricane Flora. Gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern Venezuela and from Saint Vincent northward to Martinique. Advisories on Flora emphasized {{the danger of}} the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion. The advisories also recommended small craft throughout the Windward Islands to remain at harbor and for shipping {{in the path of the}} hurricane to advise extreme caution. People in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds, as well. Lead time was short, especially in Tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just two hours before it struck.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{development}} of Tropical Storm Earl, tropical storm watches were issued for Barbados, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia. This watch was modified to a tropical storm warning by August14 at 2100UTC, {{with the addition of}} the islands of the Grenadines, <b>Trinidad,</b> <b>Tobago,</b> and Grenada. The tropical storm warning for Barbados was changed to a tropical storm watch the following day at 1200UTC, and all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 1800UTC. In preparation of the storm, several hundred people in Grenada evacuated from low-lying areas to schools set up as shelters. Shopkeepers boarded windows, while airports were temporarily shut down across the Leeward Islands. Initial forecasts predicted that Earl would strengthen considerably into a hurricane and head towards Florida once in the Caribbean Sea, a state already impacted heavily earlier in the month by Hurricane Charley. The local officials urged residents to exercise caution, but not panic due to the large errors in long-range forecasts. These warnings eased upon the system's degeneration into an open tropical wave.|$|E

About 24 hours later, all of the tropical storm warnings were discontinued. As Arthur headed further into the Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on July 26. All of the tropical storm watches and warnings were discontinued after Arthur weakened to a tropical depression. After Arthur made landfall on Tobago, several landslides occurred, and a major bridge had collapsed; electrical and water services were significantly disrupted. Damage was also reported on Grenada, where two bridges were damaged, electricity and telephone service was disrupted, and crops were affected as well.

60|$|Much {{light has}} been thrown on this curious problem since our return, by an American naturalist, Mr. Bland, {{in a paper}} read before the American Philosophical Society, on 'The Geology and Physical Geography of the West Indies, with {{reference}} to the distribution of Mollusca.' It is plain that of all animals, land-shells and reptiles give the surest tokens of any former connection of islands, being neither able to swim nor fly from one to another, and very unlikely to be carried by birds or currents. Judging, therefore, as he has a right to do, by the similarity of the land-shells, Mr. Bland is of opinion that Porto Rico, the Virgins, and the Anguilla group once formed continuous dry land, connected with Cuba, the Bahamas, and Hayti; and that their shell-fauna is of a Mexican and Central American type. The shell-fauna of the islands to the south, on the contrary, from Barbuda and St. Kitts down to Trinidad, is South American: but of two types, one Venezuelan, the other Guianan. It seems, from Mr. Bland's researches, that there must have existed once not merely an extension of the North American Continent south-eastward, but that very extension of the South American Continent northward, at which I have hinted more than once in these pages. Moreover--a fact which I certainly did not expect-- the western side of this supposed land, namely, <b>Trinidad,</b> <b>Tobago,</b> Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia, have, as far as land-shells are concerned, a Venezuelan fauna; while the eastern side of it, namely, Barbadoes, Martinique, Dominica, Guadaloupe, Antigua, etc., have, most strangely, the fauna of Guiana.|$|E
