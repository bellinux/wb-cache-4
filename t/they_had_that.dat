5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents {{the death of the}} last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency {{had begun}} {{secretly}} recruiting Lao montagnards into 100 man militia companies. Riflemen trained for these militias would receive eight weeks basic training, then serve {{several months in}} their militia. Once <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> experience, which often included their first combat, they were further recruited into battalions of irregular troops called Special Guerrilla Units. The battalions were filled out along ethnic lines, most being Hmong, but some being Yao (Iu-Mien) or Lao Theung (Lao Saetern). SGUs, once formed up, underwent three further months training by Thai officers and sergeants in Phitsanuloke, Thailand.|$|E

[...] "It {{is a piece of}} fiction." [...] The film has been praised for the realism of its premises and its overall adherence to physical principles, despite several inaccuracies and exaggerations. According to NASA Astronaut Michael J. Massimino, who took part in Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions STS-109 and STS-125, [...] "nothing was out of place, nothing was missing.

Gere's lines were recorded in New York City by Jean who, in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, stated that Gere was [...] "great" [...] and that he [...] "didn't mind being made fun of" [...] in the episode.

500|$|Secret Service {{and other}} {{authorities}} {{said they were}} treating the plot very seriously, but acknowledged it {{did not appear to}} have moved to an advanced stage. Authorities said there {{did not appear to be}} any formal assassination plan and said they were unable to immediately assess how capable the men were of carrying out the attack. Federal authorities told the Associated Press they did not believe Schlesselman and Cowart had the means to carry out their threat. Barack Obama did not have any campaign appearances planned for Tennessee. One federal law enforcement official told the AP that [...] plans did not include Obama's schedule or a specific time and place for the assassination because, [...] "I don't think <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> level of detail." [...] Authorities said they made several mistakes during their planning, including drawing too much attention to themselves with their car markings. Authorities also felt their inability to carry out a home robbery together indicated they would be unable to carry out a sophisticated assassination plot. When asked whether the alleged threats were real, Daniel Cowart's lawyer, Joe H. Byrd, told reporters, [...] "White top hats and tuxedos? You tell me." ...|$|E

500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, you could see the difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
2500|$|In total, 38 British were wounded, {{many from}} an {{explosion}} of an extensive magazine after capturing the Chuenpi fort. Commodore Bremer credited the Chinese for fighting [...] "with the greatest credit and devotion" [...] in the batteries and reported their losses at 500 to 600 out of a force of 2,000 men. The high Chinese casualties were due to the impression <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> British troops would give no quarter. 100 Chinese prisoners who laid down their arms were released the next day. 11 junks were destroyed [...] and 191 artillery pieces were captured.
