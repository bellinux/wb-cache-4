5|$|State Senator Richard Madaleno {{requested}} in 2009 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> General {{answer the}} question of whether same-sex marriages could be recognized by the state. In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to be quickly challenged in court.|$|E

50|$|In December 2006, Bush {{dismissed}} eight United States Attorneys. Though these <b>attorneys</b> {{serve at}} <b>the</b> {{pleasure of the}} president, the large-scale mid-term dismissal was without precedent, and Bush faced accusations that he had dismissed <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> for purely political reasons. During the 2006 elections, several Republican officials complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>attorneys</b> had not sufficiently investigated voter fraud. With the encouragement of Harriet Miers and Karl Rove, Attorney General Gonzales dismissed eight U.S. attorneys who were considered insufficiently supportive of the administration's policies. Though Gonzales argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> had been fired for performance reasons, publicly released documents showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> were dismissed for political reasons. After Gonzales testified before the Senate in April 2007, several Senators from both parties asked Gonzales to resign. As {{a result of the}} dismissals and the subsequent congressional investigations, Rove and Gonzales both resigned. A 2008 report found from the Justice Department inspector general found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dismissals had been politically motivated, but a special counsel found that no crimes had been committed and no one was ever prosecuted in connection to the dismissals.|$|R
5|$|The {{release of}} Invincible {{was preceded by}} a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had {{expected}} the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him {{some time in the}} early 2000s, after which {{he would be able to}} promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.|$|E

25|$|Title IX amends the National Security Act of 1947 {{to require}} the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to {{establish}} requirements and priorities for foreign intelligence collected under FISA and to provide assistance to the United States Attorney General to ensure that information derived from electronic surveillance or physical searches is disseminated for efficient and effective foreign intelligence purposes. With the exception of information that might jeopardize an ongoing law enforcement investigation, it was made a requirement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> General, or the head of any other department or agency of the Federal Government with law enforcement responsibilities, disclose to the Director any foreign intelligence acquired by the U.S. Department of Justice.

500|$|Brown was {{the first}} Prime Minister from a Scottish {{constituency}} since the Conservative Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1964. Not all British prime ministers have attended university, but {{of the ones that}} did Brown was one of only five that did not attend either Oxford or Cambridge, the others were, Lord Bute (Leiden), Lord John Russell (Edinburgh), Bonar Law (Glasgow), and Neville Chamberlain (Mason Science College, later Birmingham). Brown proposed moving some traditional prime ministerial powers conferred by royal prerogative to the realm of Parliament, such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions. Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight into the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form [...] "citizens' juries", easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> general should {{not have the right to}} decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the loans for peerages scandal.|$|E
500|$|In April 1973, the Manchester Union Leader accused Chotiner {{of having}} {{organized}} the Watergate break-in. He responded by bringing suit for libel against the Union Leader and its lead investigator. In December 1973, the parties reached a settlement by which Chotiner received an undisclosed, but substantial, {{sum of money}} and the newspaper printed a front-page apology and retraction of its accusations in its December 31, 1973 edition. Chotiner described Watergate in January 1973 as [...] "a stupid, useless, inane experiment {{by people who have}} seen too many TV shows and especially too many productions of [...] ". According to The Washington Post, Chotiner was not close to Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and most other staffers at the White House and CRP. In a taped discussion of the fallout from Watergate, Haldeman told Nixon that his former campaign manager was not [...] "wired in", and the President expressed strong opposition to Chotiner being used as a White House contact. At the suggestion that Chotiner could defend him, Nixon worried <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> might not be willing to do so.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{dismissal}} of each individual U.S. Attorney were unclear. Two suggested motivations were <b>that</b> <b>the</b> administration wanted {{to make room for}} U.S. Attorneys who would be more sympathetic to the administration's political agenda, and the administration wanted to advance the careers of promising conservatives.Critics said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> were fired for failing to prosecute Democratic politicians, for failing to prosecute claims of election fraud that would hamper Democratic voter registration, as retribution for prosecuting Republican politicians, or for failing to pursue adult obscenity prosecutions.The administration and its supporters said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> were dismissed for job-performance reasons [...] "related to policy, priorities and management", and that U.S. <b>Attorneys</b> serve at <b>the</b> pleasure of the President. However, at least six attorneys had recently received positive evaluations of their performance from the Department of Justice. In September 2008, the Department of Justice Inspector General's investigation concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dismissals were politically motivated and improper.|$|R

25|$|Lenders argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{real estate}} <b>attorney's</b> fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not {{a cost of}} the lending.

Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific <b>attorney,</b> <b>the</b> cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> and other agents to be the one used by the lender.

2500|$|The UK House of Commons held {{a debate}} on going to war on 18 March 2003 where the {{government}} motion was approved 412 to 149.

Three government ministers resigned in protest at the war, John Denham, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, and the then Leader of the House of Commons Robin Cook. In a passionate speech to the House of Commons after his resignation, he said, [...] "What has come to trouble me is the suspicion that if the 'hanging chads' of Florida had gone the other way and Al Gore had been elected, we would not now be about to commit British troops to action in Iraq."

2500|$|Another factor {{connected}} {{with these two}} schools demands separate attention, [...] {{because it is a}} consequence of segregation so outlandish <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> General, with commendable candor, has in effect refused to defend it. I refer to the fact that school bus transportation is provided those attending No. 29 who, except for color, are in the same situation as this infant plaintiff. Yet neither school bus transportation, nor its equivalent is provided this plaintiff even to attend No. 107. In fact, the State Board of Education refused to authorize the transportation of this then seven-year-old plaintiff to the Negro school, even though the bus for white children went right past her home, and even though the two schools are no more than a mile apart. Moreover, there is no public transportation available from or near plaintiff's home to or near the Negro school. The State Board ruled that because of the State constitutional provision for separate schools, a Negro child may not ride in a bus serving a white school. If we assume that this is so, then this practice in and of itself, is another reason why the facilities offered this plaintiff at No. 107 are inferior to those provided at No. 29. To suggest, under the facts here presented, that there are not enough Negroes to warrant the cost of a school bus for them is only another way of saying that they are not entitled to equal services because they are Negroes. Such an excuse will not do here.|$|E
