5|$|The first {{changes to}} the {{gameplay}} of <b>the</b> <b>Monopoly</b> game itself occurred {{with the publication of}} both <b>the</b> <b>Monopoly</b> Here & Now Electronic Banking Edition by Hasbro UK and Monopoly: The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games in 2006. The Electronic Banking Edition uses VISA-branded debit cards and a debit card reader for monetary transactions, instead of paper bills. This edition is available in the UK, Germany, France, Australia and Ireland. A version was released in the U.S. in 2007, albeit without the co-branding by Visa. An electronic counter had been featured in the Stock Exchange editions released in Europe in the early 2000s (decade), and is also a feature of <b>the</b> <b>Monopoly</b> City board game released in 2009.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Monopolies</b> and Restrictive Practices Commission {{was set up}} on 1 January 1949, in {{response}} to the recommendations of several committees of inquiry into restrictive commercial activity. It was established under <b>the</b> <b>Monopolies</b> and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act 1948. It was reconstituted as <b>the</b> <b>Monopolies</b> Commission on 31 October 1956 by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1955, which also set up a Restrictive Practices Court and a registrar of restrictive trading agreements. The Commission was again reconstituted, and its powers extended, by <b>the</b> <b>Monopolies</b> and Mergers Act 1965. In 1969 oversight of the Commission passed to the Department of Employment and Productivity, and in 1970 to the Department of Trade and Industry. Under the Fair Trading Act 1973 the Commission became, from 1 November 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Monopolies</b> and Mergers Commission, with wider powers to deal with references either from the Office of Fair Trading or from the Department of Trade and Industry. On 1 April 1999, {{as a result of the}} Competition Act 1998, it became the Competition Commission.|$|R

25|$|Under this {{ascendancy}} of the military, the country developed a very hierarchical, aristocratic economic system with significant state involvement. During the Meiji Restoration, {{there had been}} a surge in <b>the</b> creation of <b>monopolies.</b> This was in part due to state intervention, as <b>the</b> <b>monopolies</b> served to allow Japan to become a world economic power. The state itself owned some of <b>the</b> <b>monopolies,</b> and others were owned by <b>the</b> zaibatsu. <b>The</b> <b>monopolies</b> managed <b>the</b> central core of the economy, with other aspects being controlled by the government ministry appropriate to the activity, including the National Central Bank and the Imperial family. This economic arrangement was in many ways similar to the later corporatist models of European fascists.|$|R
5|$|In Elizabethan England, music {{printing}} was {{regulated by}} two royal patents {{issued by the}} queen: one for metrical psalters (psalms set to music) and one for all other types of music and music paper. The patent-holders thus held a monopoly—only they or their assignees could legally print music. After printer John Day's death in 1584, the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees, {{who were members of}} the Stationers' Company. The more general one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575. Despite <b>the</b> <b>monopoly,</b> Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavours; their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur failed to sell and was a financial disaster. After Tallis died in 1585, Byrd continued holding the patent, producing works with his assignee, Thomas East. <b>The</b> <b>monopoly</b> expired in 1596, prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley {{to take advantage of the}} resulting power vacuum.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, Waddingtons, UK {{publishers}} of <b>the</b> <b>Monopoly</b> boardgame, raised {{objections to the}} Automonopoli title, saying {{that there was a}} risk purchasers would confuse the two products. Automata changed the name of the product to Go to Jail in their packaging and advertising, claiming in their advertising that despite being identical in every way, Go to Jail was unrelated to Automonopoli.|$|E
5|$|Waddingtons later {{produced}} special games during World War II which secretly contained files, a compass, a map {{printed on}} silk, and real currency hidden amongst <b>the</b> <b>Monopoly</b> money, to enable {{prisoners of war}} to escape from German camps.

5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China {{was able to keep}} a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. <b>The</b> <b>monopoly</b> was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Monopolies</b> and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 had its genesis in the Directive Principles of State Policy {{embodied}} in the Constitution of India. It received the assent of the President of India on 27 December, 1969. <b>The</b> <b>Monopolies</b> and Restrictive Trade Practices Act was intended to curb the rise of concentration of wealth in a few hands and of monopolistic practices. It was repealed on September 2009. The Act has been succeeded by The Competition Act, 2002.|$|R

5|$|One of the {{economic}} foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the Empire. Textiles must have been {{by far the most}} important item of export; silks were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West. The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> of issuing coinage, maintaining a durable and flexible monetary system adaptable to trade needs.|$|E
5|$|The TVR {{line would}} {{dominate}} the transportation of coal throughout the Rhondda's industrial history, and its monopoly {{was a point}} of contention, as with no rivals the colliery owners could not negotiate for haulage rates. Several {{attempts were made to}} break <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> including the opening of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, between 1885 and 1895, which linked Blaenrhondda {{at the head of the}} Rhondda Fawr to the Prince of Wales Dock. To achieve this rail link the Rhondda Tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to Blaengwynfi; at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The set {{has been}} celebrated by <b>the</b> <b>Monopoly</b> pub crawl, which {{attempts}} to visit all the locations {{on the board}} and have a drink at a pub in each one. The relative wealth of the various places has changed slightly. Whitechapel Road is now the cheapest (as opposed to Old Kent Road) but Mayfair remains the most expensive; in 2016 an estimate by loan provider West One showed the average house price on each was £590,000 and £3,150,000 respectively.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} its existence, the only staged {{performances}} of Parsifal {{took place in the}} Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had two reasons for wanting to keep Parsifal exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him – a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> on its performance.|$|E
5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created <b>the</b> <b>monopoly</b> of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development in the future.|$|E
5|$|Park Lane is {{the second}} most {{valuable}} property in the London edition of the board game Monopoly. The street had a prestigious social status when the British version of <b>the</b> <b>Monopoly</b> board was first produced, in 1936. On the board, Park Lane forms a pair with Mayfair, the most expensive property in the game. The squares were designed to be equivalents of Park Place and Boardwalk, respectively, on the original board, which used streets in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988, the World Monopoly Championships were held at the Park Lane Hotel, sponsored by Waddingtons, manufacturers of the British version. Since the game's original production, prices on the real Park Lane have held their value, though average rent costs have been overtaken by Bond Street.|$|E
