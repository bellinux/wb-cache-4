These involve the use of high-speed still and cine photography, together with measurements of yam speed on emergence from the nozzle and yarn-tension measurements at various stages of the process. The results of these experiments provide {{a better understanding of}} the filament behaviour during the texturing process.

30|$|A single {{position}} commercial air-jet <b>texturing</b> <b>machine</b> {{was modified}} to make both air-jet and steam-jet textured yarns under similar processing parameters. The machine has two feed rollers where the effect yarn overfeed {{can be changed}} from 37.9 % to 53.0 %. The machine was designed originally to supply compressed air to the texturing nozzle. At {{the start of the}} steam-jet texturing research, the machine was modified to supply either compressed air or high-pressure steam for the texturing nozzle. The jet box seal was modified to prevent steam and condensate from escaping. This also reduced the noise level and improved the safety of the steam process. Following process parameters, which are based on commercial specification in making 120 ticket number (TKT) air-jet sewing thread, have been maintained constant in the study so as to eliminate the effects of other parameters on texturing.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the mechanics and dynamics of a process for increasing bulk, softness, cover and stretch of thermoplastic continuous filament yarns. In particular this investigation focuses on the interactions between the feed yarn and the <b>texturing</b> <b>machine</b> in the draw texturing process. It treats the cases of both steady state and transient operation. The degree of filament drawing, the cold, hot, cooling and post spindle twist distributions, the threadline tension, and the threadline torque are shown to possess a non-linear relationship dictated by machine-material parameters. This study presents a tractable model for determining analytically threadline torque, tension, and twist distributions,- given information on machine settings and on material properties. Considerable attention is devoted to the determination of twist distribu-tion in the threadline during transient operation. The results of numerous observations of threadline response were compared with the data generated from the analysis of threadline operation. In general, the agreement between theory and experiment is good...|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to investigate the}} use of steam as a substitute fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing. The new substitute product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. Generally high-pressure steam is known to be cheaper to produce than compressed air. An existing air-jet <b>texturing</b> <b>machine</b> was modified to supply either air or steam to the texturing nozzle. Using an identical nozzle, both air-jet and steam-jet textured yarns were manufactured. The influence of effect-yarn parameters on the steam-jet texturing performance has been studied. Furthermore, steam-jet texturing was compared with air-jet texturing in terms of the processing parameters and the textured yarn properties. The results show that spun-like textured yarn manufactured using steam has lower loop instability, lower loop density and higher tensile properties than air at comparable fluid pressures. SEM image analysis shows that the entangled structure of the steam-jet textured yarns is comparable to the air-jet textured yarns. To verify the commercial feasibility of the new product, sewing threads were manufactured using both steam-jet and air-jet textured yarns and tested for sewability under commercial specifications. Sewability results indicated that the steam-jet textured sewing threads can withstand sewing at high-speeds like air-jet textured threads and are therefore suitable for manufacture of sewing threads. Therefore, it can be concluded that steam can be used as an alternative fluid for air in making spun-like textured yarns.|$|E

Applications of such technologies are restricted because of the limited choice of materials, small part size and low part accuracy.

40|$|The textural {{properties}} of apple, banana, carrot and potato were experimentally determined by uniaxial compressive tests of cylindrical specimens {{at a constant}} deformation rate of 5 mm/min. Compression tests were performed, following air drying, at various moisture contents ranging from 0. 2 to 6 kg/kg db. The tests were performed using a universal <b>texture</b> testing <b>machine</b> and simple mathematical equations were used to correlate-the maximum experimental stress and the corresponding strain to the moisture content. It was shown that the maximum stress decreases as the moisture content decreases, until a critical moisture content of 1. 8 kg water/kg dry solids. Further removal of water tends to increase the maximum stress. The maximum experimental strain was found to increase as water was removed. The stress-strain data of compression test were modelled using a simple mathematical model, containing parameters such as the maximum stress (sigma(max)), the maximum strain (epsilon(max)), the elastic parameter (E) and the viscoelastic exponent (p).

The {{aim of this study}} was to establish methods to mechanically measure and predict water releasing or absorptive tendency during mastication. There were ten ingredients used. Six, Japanese radish, carrot, potato, salmon, chicken, and scallops were typically heated. The remaining four, apple, bread, cookies and kamaboko were used as is. Eight grams of water was added to 8  g of the ingredient, which was blended for 1  s in a mixer. After blending, the mixture was centrifuged or compressed using a <b>texture</b> analyzer <b>machine.</b> Ingredients were weighed before and after processing without water, and the percent increase in weight was calculated using the weight of the ingredients. Results demonstrated that three ingredients (Japanese radish, carrot, apple), which have strong tendencies for releasing, showed lower percent increases in weight, while two ingredients (cookies, bread), which have strong tendencies for water absorption, showed higher percent weight increases. The other five ingredients (potato, kamaboko, salmon, chicken, and scallops), which have no water releasing or absorption tendencies, showed mid-value percent increases in weight. The tendencies using all treatment methods were the same as during mastication. The percent increase in weight using two processing methods strongly correlated with increased rates of mastication, and demonstrated uncertainty equal to that of mastication. These methods may be helpful in establishing an index for ease of swallowing for classified diets in patients with dysphagia.|$|R

The proposed method evaluates multiple properties of surface texture from a laser speckle pattern, such as roughness, period, and degree of similarity in periodic micro surface structures. By investigating experimentally the relation between surface texture and laser speckle pattern of machined surfaces, several characteristic parameters of laser speckle, such as the mean intensity, the autocorrelation length of intensity distribution, and the degree of similarity between adjacent speckle patterns are proposed for evaluating surface texture properties. In addition, the anisotropy of micro surface structure is assessed by using the proposed parameters of laser speckle pattern...|$|R
