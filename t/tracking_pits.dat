50|$|At that time, Qadian had no {{significance}} in the area at all with population {{of a few hundred}} people and only a sandy <b>track</b> <b>pitted</b> with pot holes connected the town with Batala. People were totally ignorant and uneducated. There was total lack of urban amenities and facilities.|$|R
50|$|Roary the Racing Car is set {{around a}} fictional {{motor racing circuit}} called Silver Hatch (a {{portmanteau}} {{of the names of}} the two British Grand Prix racing circuits, Silverstone and Brands Hatch). The majority of the action takes place at the <b>track's</b> <b>pits</b> and workshop, although we often follow the cars on their laps around the track. Occasionally, the characters venture to external locations such as the nearby beach.|$|R
50|$|The event see young drivers {{compete with}} KF3 karts, a class for top drivers aged 12 to 15. The course circuit follows {{the lower part}} of the famous Formula One track, in a large section of the port, from Tabac corner, round the {{swimming}} pool, and on to the Rascasse before entering the F1 <b>track's</b> <b>pit</b> lane. A ramp and a hairpin connect this part of the track back to the port section.|$|R

50|$|It was a grim, {{mountainous area}} with narrow, winding <b>tracks,</b> <b>pitted</b> with shell holes which turned to {{slippery}} mud {{in the heavy}} rain. The task of the 78th Division was, as part of Lieutenant-General Sidney C. Kirkman's British XIII Corps (which at this time formed {{the right wing of}} Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army), to join in the offensive to break through the mountains to the Lombardy plain. The battalion's role was to capture two objectives, Monte La Pieve and Monte Spaduro, which blocked the advance.|$|R
5000|$|A HMD {{system has}} been {{developed}} for Formula One drivers by Kopin Corp. and the BMW Group. According to BMW, [...] "The HMD {{is part of an}} advanced telemetry system approved for installation by the Formula One racing committee… to communicate to the driver wirelessly from the heart of the race pit." [...] The HMD will display critical race data while allowing the driver to continue focusing on the <b>track.</b> <b>Pit</b> crews control the data and messages sent to their drivers through two-way radio.|$|R
40|$|Mikael Jansson {{photographs}} Formula 1 : cars, drivers, mechanics, race <b>tracks,</b> <b>pit</b> lanes, and spectators. But {{behind the}} colourful surface, the glistening bodywork, the noisy engines {{and the smell}} of burning rubber lies a fundamental concern with the power of the image - both in photographic and contemporary culture terms. Ulrich Lehmann wrote the text: points on a line from A to B, which comprises of seven short prose pieces entitled: start, accelerate, bodywork, passage, motoring on, finish line and closing up. The description above is taken from the library catalogue record for this item...|$|R
50|$|In 2014, the Speed Energy Formula Off-Road series (also {{known as}} Stadium Super Trucks) held a doubleheader event {{on a small}} {{modified}} course at {{the northwest corner of}} the track. This incorporated a portion of the oval <b>track’s</b> <b>pit</b> entry, two small portions of the road course, a segment of an access lane, and dirt areas in between, with two jump ramps added. This occurred during the Indy 500's Carb Day activities, and marked the first time in track history that trucks were raced. Series founder Robby Gordon had tested at the track in April.|$|R
5000|$|To {{capitalize}} on the nation's new attraction to auto racing following World War II, park owner Edward J. Carroll demolished the dance hall that had burned down in 1948. In its place rose a flat 1/5 mile oval <b>track,</b> <b>pit</b> area and grandstand alongside the Connecticut River. The first full season of [...] "modified" [...] stock car racing was 1949. International sports car racing star Phil Walters, who raced modifieds and midgets under the name [...] "Ted Tappett", won the season championship. The United Stock Car Racing Club events drew 6,000-8,000 fans every Saturday night.|$|R
50|$|On {{the final}} lap, Pat O'Keefe landed off a jump erratically, causing his truck to slide over the second ramp {{before hitting the}} catchfence {{dividing}} the <b>track</b> from <b>pit</b> road. The wreck ended the race as Sheldon Creed was declared the winner.|$|R
5|$|Both Omar's {{father and}} uncle were killed {{following}} a mortar attack on Bakaara Market, where they worked. Omar {{was in the}} eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold produce to provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel running <b>track,</b> <b>pitted</b> with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{disputes}} in 1877 and 1885 {{also led to}} evictions. All of the coal at Denaby was [...] "hand got", meaning that no machinery or conveyor belts were used. The Barnsley Seam coal was shovelled into corves for man handling along a <b>track</b> using <b>pit</b> ponies.|$|R
50|$|The depot was at Hougue-a-la-Pierre, and {{consisted}} of a shed with three <b>tracks</b> with <b>pits,</b> together with the power house and workshops, all built of stone and brick. The power plant comprised two locomotive type boilers, each fitted with a Friedman injector and a feed water heater, and fed by a Worthington pump.|$|R

5000|$|The {{workshop}} and fitting bays were each 183 by 18 metres in size, with four tracks and three inspection pits. For {{the handling of}} bogies under overhaul there were 24 short traverse <b>tracks</b> and <b>pits.</b> Two 25 tonne cranes were installed in the lifting bay, and two 15 tonne electric cranes were provided in the workshop bay.|$|R
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16 years old, Samiya Yuusf Omar was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Prior to the competition, she trained at the Mogadishu Stadium on a gravel <b>track</b> <b>pitted</b> by mortar craters. She explained {{that she would be}} routinely harassed while training by local militia groups, fighting in the Somali Civil War, and both friends and family had been pressuring her to stop training. She explained, [...] "Traditionally Somalis view the girls as corrupted if they join in with things like sports and music. It's because they sometimes wear transparent clothes or shorts. Therefore I have been coming under pressure from all different sides." [...] She continued to practice following encouragement from her mother, although had not expected to be chosen for the Games due to her age and as she was from a minority ethnic group.|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} of Bruner provides {{the foundation for}} England Stadium which holds 3,000 spectators. The stadium field is used for both football and soccer and features a synthetic turf surface. It {{is surrounded by a}} 400-meter all-weather <b>track</b> with <b>pits</b> for pole vault, long jump, and steeplechase. Lights to illuminate the field were added to the stadium in the fall of 2014.|$|R
50|$|Contamination: paint, powder, acid or {{alkaline}} fluids, abrasives, glass bead, steel shot, etc. can all lead {{to rapid}} deterioration of track and chain. Ask any bearing company about {{the leading cause}} of bearing failure and they will point to contamination. Once a foreign substance lands on the raceway of a bearing or on the <b>track,</b> <b>pitting</b> of the surface will occur, and once the surface is compromised, wear will accelerate. Building shrouds around your conveyors can help prevent the ingress of contaminants. Or, pressurize the contained area using a simple fan and duct arrangement. Contamination can also apply to belts (causing slippage, {{or in the case of}} some materials premature wear), and of the motors themselves. Since the motors can generate a considerable amount of heat, keeping the surface clean is an almost-free maintenance procedure that can keep heat from getting trapped by dust and grime, which may lead to motor burnout.|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between point and line resolution in {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) arises because an ability to image sub- 0. 2 nm fringes is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for imaging individual atoms. In scanned tip microscopy, as in TEM, empirical data on instrument response should precede assertions about point resolution. In the ``slow scan limit'', time-domain noise and geometry effects decouple, and tip shape can take {{on the role of}} a 2 -dimensional impulse response function. We indicate here that nuclear <b>track</b> <b>pits</b> can be used to quantitatively measure tip geometry with nanometer-scale resolution in three dimensions, that stationary tip images provide a robust measure of time-domain instabilities, and that when these data are taken before and after imaging an unknown, images with instrument response quantitatively constrained by experiment are possible. Specimen-induced tip effects also become measurable in situ. Comment: 4 pages (1 fig, 16 refs) RevTeX; apps [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Track Condition Radio - helps alert {{drivers with}} {{critical}} information by transmitting messages from race {{control to the}} racecar. A dash-mounted display communicates messages including safety warnings, <b>track</b> condition and <b>pits</b> opened/closed.|$|R
2500|$|Since NASCAR {{does not}} allow speedometers or {{electronic}} speed limiting devices, the pace car circles the <b>track</b> at <b>pit</b> road speed during the warm-up laps. This allows each driver to note the RPM at which pit road speed is maintained. Drivers exceeding that speed on pit road will be penalized, typically a [...] "drive-through" [...] or [...] "stop and go" [...] penalty, costing them valuable track position.|$|R
50|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} broadcast from various locations {{in and around}} the <b>track,</b> from <b>pit</b> road to the infield to the garage. Eventually this format was dropped and Trackside was re-located to the Speed Stage which was usually placed outside of the racetrack. Guests included former and current NASCAR drivers as well as NASCAR personalities and celebrities that happened to be at the track.|$|R
50|$|This event {{takes place}} on a long jump <b>track</b> and <b>pit.</b> Rather than landing feet first, contestants jump headlong; if their feet touch the sand, their effort is a no-jump. Liam Collins who jumped a world record 8.96 m. The jump itself cannot be classed as a world track and field record as the head long {{technique}} is not permitted in actual Olympic Games.|$|R
5000|$|Since NASCAR {{does not}} allow speedometers or {{electronic}} speed limiting devices, the pace car circles the <b>track</b> at <b>pit</b> road speed during the warm-up laps.

5000|$|Any car {{being driven}} {{unnecessarily}} slowly, erratically, or which is deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers, will {{be reported to}} the stewards. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the <b>track,</b> the <b>pit</b> entry or the pit lane. In order to avoid coming under the scrutiny of the stewards, a driver must return to the pits within a pre-determined lap time set by the stewards.|$|R
5000|$|Because of this, race teams plan a pit {{strategy}} {{prior to}} the start of every race. This is a schedule for each car's planned pit stops during the race, and takes into account factors such as rate of fuel consumption, weight of fuel, cornering speed with each available tyre compound, rate of tyre wear, the effect of tyre wear on cornering speed, the length of pit road and the <b>track's</b> <b>pit</b> road speed limit, and even expected changes in weather and lighting conditions. The pit strategy does not just include a schedule of when pit stops will happen; it also includes what service and adjustments are scheduled for each pit stop, particularly in endurance racing, where scheduled changes of wear-limited parts such as brake pads may be planned for specific points during the race. The pit strategy is calculated carefully so that the amount of time to be [...] "given away" [...] to other competitors in pit stops is balanced out by the time gained while on the track, resulting, theoretically, in the shortest possible time to cover the scheduled distance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sporting}} complex [...] "Erlfeld" [...] {{also offers}} {{a wide variety of}} facilities for track and field. There is a 400 m running <b>track,</b> a sand <b>pit</b> for long jump and a discus throwing circle.|$|R
5000|$|Super-signal - Also {{abbreviated}} to 'Super', {{this was the}} main digital world feed produced by FOM for all of Europe, combining footage from the below two <b>track</b> feeds, the <b>Pit</b> lane channel and the onboard channel.|$|R
50|$|Other {{highlights}} of the facility are a quarter-mile <b>track</b> between the <b>pit</b> road and the main track for Legends racing and a 2.5 mi FIA-approved road course. In 1996, the speedway hosted the Countryfest concert, attracting over 200,000 fans.|$|R
