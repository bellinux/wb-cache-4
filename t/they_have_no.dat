6000|$|But {{be these}} English {{creditors}} what they may, the creditors most certainly not fraudulent are the natives, who are numerous and wretched indeed: by exhausting the whole revenues of the Carnatic, nothing is left for them. They lent bonâ fide; {{in all probability}} they were even forced to lend, or to give goods and service for the Nabob's obligations. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> trusts to carry to his market. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> faith of alliances to sell. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> nations to betray to robbery and ruin. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> lawful government seditiously to overturn; nor <b>had</b> <b>they</b> a governor, to whom it is owing that you exist in India, to deliver over to captivity, and {{to death in a}} shameful prison.[25] ...|$|R
5|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are common}} as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater {{variance}} in their coats than {{those found in}} the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, and as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> fixed breeding season, can continue to produce large numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} birds, the Columbidae have no gall bladders. Some medieval naturalists {{concluded}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> bile (gall), {{which in the}} medieval theory of the four humours explained the allegedly sweet disposition of doves. In fact, however, they do have gall (as Aristotle had earlier realised), which is secreted directly into the gut.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Burns learns of the school's oil and {{immediately}} decides {{that he must}} have it, even as Smithers voices his disapproval. After failing to convince Principal Skinner to give him the oil, Mr. Burns establishes a slant drilling operation and beats the school to tapping the oil well. The school is told <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> legal recourse, and Willie and Puente are laid off to cover the school's losses.|$|E

5|$|Noted Benchers of Gray's Inn include Lord Birkenhead and Francis Bacon. Honorary Benchers {{can also}} be appointed, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> role in Pension, such as Lord Denning, who was appointed in 1979, and Winston Churchill. Today there are over 300 Benchers in Gray's Inn, mostly senior barristers {{and members of the}} judiciary.|$|E

60|$|And {{why they}} came toward the Fountain {{at all is}} a mystery; for <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{business}} there. It was not in their way.

5|$|The {{question}} in the case was whether Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained even if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The ten {{reserves}} {{existing in}} 2012 had a combined area of 6,016ha (14,863acres), 78percent of the SSSI. Although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> legal protection {{beyond that of}} privately owned land, they may have more active management or provide visitor facilities. The mixed ownership reflects land becoming available for purchase or management at various times, and the differing priorities of the conservation bodies.|$|E

5|$|The {{tinamous}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|Their fur is {{darker than}} other spaniels and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{undercoat}} {{like most of}} the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other source of vitamin B.|$|E
