5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>and</b> the Door was {{produced}} by Mark A. Miller. Most of the recording {{and all of the}} mixing for the album was done by Sam Hewitt at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee and My Refuge Studio in McDonough, Georgia; additional recording was done by Michael Hewitt and Dale Oliver at those same locations. The strings on <b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>and</b> the Door were arranged by Bernie Herms and recorded by Bill Whittington and Steve Beers at The Sound Kitchen in Franklin, Tennessee.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>and</b> the Door was {{released}} on August 28, 2007. It sold 129,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200, behind only the soundtrack to High School Musical 2. It also debuted atop the Billboard Christian Albums chart and at number two on the Billboard Digital Albums chart. It was the band's largest sales week and highest charting album to date, easily beating 2005's Lifesong which debuted at number nine and sold 71,000 copies in its first week. It was also {{the largest number of}} first-week sales achieved by a Christian artist without support from secular media, with roughly 70% of its first-week sales coming from Christian stores. In its second week, <b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>and</b> the Door sold 41,000 copies. It topped the Billboard Christian Albums chart for 12 non-consecutive weeks from 2007–2008. As a result of the album being offered as a discount at Family Christian Stores, <b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>and</b> the Door topped the Billboard Catalog Albums chart in 2010; it spent a total of five non-consecutive weeks atop that chart. It has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of more than 1million copies. As of March 2014, the album has sold 1.2 million copies.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the chapel was {{extensively}} restored {{with the assistance}} of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a Fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> <b>and</b> the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel. The Chaplain is Rev Dr Robert Tobin and the Senior Organ Scholar for 2010-11 was Edwin Lock. At that time David Maw was appointed Director of Chapel Music.|$|E

50|$|The church {{building}} remained unchanged, {{save for a}} replacement organ in the mid-1960s, until 1982. Renovations to the sanctuary that year removed <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> rails <b>and</b> prayer stalls installed after the fire over 60 years earlier. <b>The</b> masonry <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> <b>altar</b> stone were replaced with a freestanding <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> moved to <b>the</b> outdoors, where they {{were placed on the}} hillside.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>altars</b> <b>and</b> idols {{are placed}} at the {{opposite}} end; and two long parallel benches, like cathedral stalls, run down {{the centre of the}} building: on these the monks sit at prayer and contemplation, the head Lama occupying a stall (often of very tasteful design) near <b>the</b> <b>altar.</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{the five}} pendentives along each {{side and the}} two at either end, Michelangelo painted the largest figures on the ceiling: twelve people who prophesied or {{represented}} {{some aspect of the}} Coming of Christ. Of those twelve, seven were Prophets of Israel and were male. The remaining five were prophets of the Classical World, called Sibyls and were female. The prophet Jonah is placed above <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> Zechariah at the further end. The other male and female figures alternate down each side, each being identified by an inscription on a painted marble panel supported by a putto.|$|E
5|$|The bronze lectern {{was given}} to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677–78. Except for the pews on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> carved communion rails. Behind the altar is Bernard van Orley's The Carrying of the Cross — a companion-piece to this {{painting}} is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry to}} the vestry {{is located at the}} end of the right side aisle next to the choir; {{at the end of the}} left side aisle is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The {{tabernacle}} is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the Diocese of Verona. The ambo—a projection coming out from the soleas—is on the right side of <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> <b>and</b> is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, on the wall of the apse, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by architect Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are located on the left and the right sides (respectively) of the corbels. On the opposite side of <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50choristers; a large part of it is now occupied by the organ.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> Rosary Society (ARS) has {{promoted}} various Ukrainian {{cultural and social}} activities, bringing the various components of the society together. When the church was erected, <b>the</b> <b>Altar</b> Rosary Society covered {{the cost of the}} installation of the marble floor and apsidial wall. They also sponsored the royal throne, <b>the</b> <b>altars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tabernacle. Additionally they provided <b>and</b> maintained <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> linens <b>and</b> many of the vestments. To raise this money, <b>the</b> <b>Altar</b> Rosary Society sponsored fashion shows, bake sales, yearly pascha sale, turkey raffles, bazaars, white-elephant sales, family picnics. Additionally, the members staffed the kitchen, and equipped the church hall kitchen for dinners, picnics, carnivals, breakfasts and other activities.|$|R

50|$|Pope Francis {{visited the}} shrine on September 23, 2015, and celebrated a Mass for the canonization of Junípero Serra, O.F.M. {{on the mall}} of The Catholic University of America. <b>The</b> <b>altar,</b> ambo, <b>and</b> chair used for this Mass match the {{existing}} marble in the basilica. After the Mass, <b>the</b> Papal <b>altar</b> was {{placed in front of}} <b>the</b> High <b>Altar,</b> <b>and</b> is now used as <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> in <b>the</b> Great Upper Church.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church has nineteen stained glass windows, three behind <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> eight along {{each side of the}} church building. The windows behind the altar focus on St. Joseph and depict, from right to left, the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt; the daily lives of the Holy Family; and the death of Joseph. Four of the sixteen windows {{on the sides of the}} church (those closest to <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> those closest to the doors) depict lilies. The remaining twelve windows each depict a single saint, including Ignatius of Loyola, Stanislaus Kostka, and Saint Cecilia. Further ornamentation of the walls includes carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross as well as twelve triforiums holding paintings illustrating the Lord's Prayer, the Bread of Life Discourse, and praise to Christ and Mary. On top of the altar, at the eastern end of the church, is a tabernacle. The altar, imported from Germany in 1880, is decorated with statues of Abraham, Peter, Paul, and Melchizedek.|$|E
5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} side, the first chapel was {{dedicated}} to the Nativity of Mary. Since 1573 this chapel, the giuspatronato of the Milanese Carcano family, contained the stone reportedly used for Isaac's sacrifice. A Ricci painting {{of the birth of}} Mary was on its altar; on its vault were the Four Evangelists, and its walls were decorated with frescoes. The second chapel, dedicated to San Giacomo, had a statue (later replaced by a painting) of the saint above <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> was the burial place for members of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. The third chapel, dedicated to the Crucifixion, contained a large sculpture of Christ on the cross.|$|E

5|$|Spurs remade for CharlesII {{are taken}} from <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> {{presented}} to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Known originally as StGeorge's Spurs, {{they are one of}} the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Gold spurs were introduced into the coronation ceremony in 1189 at the coronation of RichardI. Historically, the spurs were fastened to the monarch's feet but since the Restoration they are simply brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens and placed on the altar.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharistic celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).|$|E
5|$|As {{the people}} inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore in a corner by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and,</b> despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E
25|$|During the {{suppression}} of the monasteries All Saints' medieval stained glass was destroyed, as was, in 1561, a rood screen with its attached gilded crucifix and figures of Mary and St John, and the Easter Sepulchre.

5|$|In 1633, Charles {{appointed}} William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury. Together, {{they began}} a series of anti-Calvinist reforms that attempted to ensure religious uniformity by restricting non-conformist preachers, insisting that the liturgy be celebrated as prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer, organising the internal architecture of English churches so as to emphasise the sacrament of <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> <b>and</b> re-issuing King James's Declaration of Sports, which permitted secular activities on the sabbath. The Feoffees for Impropriations, an organisation that bought benefices and advowsons so that Puritans could be appointed to them, was dissolved. To prosecute those who opposed his reforms, Laud used the two most powerful courts in the land, the Court of High Commission and the Court of Star Chamber. The courts became feared for their censorship of opposing religious views, and became unpopular among the propertied classes for inflicting degrading punishments on gentlemen. For example, in 1637 William Prynne, Henry Burton and John Bastwick were pilloried, whipped and mutilated by cropping and imprisoned indefinitely for publishing anti-episcopal pamphlets.|$|E
5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments to the north of <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south. The carved oak pulpion a stone base and the oak eagle lectern date from the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The Village {{was almost}} {{completely}} self-contained, {{with its own}} shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>and</b> a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development {{was close to the}} pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.|$|E
