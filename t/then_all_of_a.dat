Each superelement substructure is derived {{by applying the}} principle of static condensation. Rectangular 9 -node flat shell elements, which are composed of membrane stress and Mindlin plate bending elements, are assembled together to make the stiffness and load matrices of each panel substructure. Every panel substructure is condensed to <b>a</b> panel superelement. <b>Then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them in <b>a</b> layer are assembled together and condensed to layer superelement. Finally, the later superelement(s) are assembled and condensed to yield to caisson superelement. After the assembling process, equilibrium equations are solved for the caisson superelement.

Based on this approach, a computer program is developed which takes the most advantage from the repetition of similar individual elements and panels.
