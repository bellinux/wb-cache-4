Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003) {{indicates}} Potter was venturing into new territory in creating a tale with a large human presence (Lucie). Potter's artistic uncertainty is evident in her attempt to establish a relationship between clothes and the social and animal selves of humans and animals. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle wears human clothing while the neighbourhood animals wear and shed only their skins. Logically, Kutzer points out, all the animals should wear either human clothing or only their skins. She believes Peter Rabbit's blue jacket {{is used in the}} tale as a gimmick to remind the reader that other Potter books exist for purchase, and a gimmick that disrupts Potter's artistic intent. If Peter wears human clothing <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> the other animals wear only their skins? The issue of animal clothing versus human clothing is further confused when Mrs. Tiggy-winkle sheds her human clothing {{at the end of the}} tale to reveal herself a hedgehog who may or may not be able to shed her skin as well. If she can shed her skin, then why is she wearing human clothes? [...] Kutzer believes these questions remain unanswered and erode the tale's logic.|$|E

60|$|HUSH <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you cry? It's {{you and me}} {{the same}} as before.|$|E
5000|$|If God is both {{willing and}} able to prevent evil, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> evil exist? ...|$|R
60|$|INSPECTOR. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> {{you say you}} did? There's been a theft here, and {{anything}} you say may be used against you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> {{you come}} and disturb me?" [...] she said, almost angrily, if not quite, an {{enlarging}} red spot rising in each cheek.|$|R
60|$|MISS T. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> {{you always}} stand out after {{half a dozen}} turns? I thought {{officers}} in the Army didn't tell fibs.|$|E
6000|$|BARBARA. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> {{you keep}} {{thinking}} about it? Why does it keep coming up against {{you in your}} mind? You're not getting converted, are you? ...|$|E
6000|$|Tall black Bacchae of midnight, why <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>Do</b> you rush to assail me? Do I {{intrude on}} your rites nocturnal? What should it avail me? ...|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> you--[He {{is going}} to say: [...] "Kiss me," [...] but checks himself]--let me think you hadn't any friends? Who is this fellow? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If Sri N.C Lahiri Ayanamsa is correct, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> Sri N.C Lahiri {{agree to}} change {{one or two}} minutes of Arc in his Ayanamsa? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> he mention about Labour and recalculation of Panchangas?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lamoureux {{says that}} leeches {{would have saved}} her [...] Had they been used in time, before I came. [...] In that case, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> he wait for me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. But I been {{in other}} towns like him, an' know {{this kind of}} hotel. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> I sleep in front seat of motor car?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand. We {{are quite}} willing, since it lies upon our road. But <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you come against us, who are {{peaceful}} travellers, with your spears lifted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still I do not understand," [...] said Margaret more softly. [...] "You {{say that}} your life or welfare hung on this shameful business. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you reveal it to me now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|O cruelty, {{the insight}} barred me <b>then!</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> I not possess me with its sound, And in its cadence catch and catch again Your nature's essence {{floating}} therearound? ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET (in a tree). <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> he stand so long at the door? And {{before he}} has gone she bursts out laughing, for she has been awake all the time.|$|R
6000|$|LEE TAI. We {{sought to}} rule this great people not by force, but by wisdom. And for centuries we succeeded. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> {{the white man}} despise the yellow? Shall I tell you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you {{all three}} prefer Douglas? And you, boys, who are such Tories, {{will you go}} see a play which is wrote by a Whig Scotchman, who was {{actually}} made prisoner at Falkirk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you take}} it <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> you do it? Your life is not like his. Oh, Scatcherd! Scatcherd!" [...] and the doctor {{prepared}} to pour out the flood of his eloquence in beseeching this singular man to abstain from his well-known poison.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know how}} willing I am to help you, Cytherea,' she added reproachfully. 'You know it. Why {{are you so}} obstinate <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> you selfishly bar the clear, honourable, and only sisterly path which leads out of this difficulty? I cannot, on my conscience, countenance you; no, I cannot.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> {{you begin}} with your detestable red-nosed giantesses? And she would, she would, she would, she would, she WOULD powder it!’ cries Rosa, {{in a little}} burst of comical {{contradictory}} spleen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am nearly six. Did {{you love}} {{grandmother}}? <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> you {{never come to}} see her? Did grandmother know you was here? Why not? Why didn't I not know about you till after grandmother died?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{be damned}} if this isn't the queerest start ever I know'd," [...] said Mr. Fairway. [...] "I didn't mean you at all. There's another in the country, <b>then!</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> ye reveal yer misfortune, Christian?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, {{and twice}} {{in the months that}} {{followed}} you passed me on the street and did not know me, Martin almost said aloud. Each time I was hungry and heading for the pawnbroker. Yet it was work performed. You did not know me <b>then.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> you know me now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it is {{possible}} for the workingman to rise under a capitalistic system, why do you not rise, <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> I not rise? I'm as good as Ditmar, I'm better educated, but we're all slaves. What right has a man to make you and me work for him just because he has capital?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What in {{the name}} of Pluto is the matter with you all?" [...] cried the amazed senator, whose night of potations had left him in no mood for patience. [...] "Why do you stand moping there? Stephanos, Vacculus, is {{anything}} amiss? Here, Promus, you are the head of my household. What is it, <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> you turn your eyes away from me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God help me," [...] {{said the}} poor man, {{searching for his}} handkerchief, and utterly confounded, [...] "why is it you have come to me, <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> you wake me up?" [...] he added, so far forgetting himself.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1975 {{there is}} a saying that says [...] "if it came to Cascas and took no wine, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> he come". Grape is {{produced}} throughout the year. Wines of all types from malbec to special sacramental wine.|$|R
6000|$|Oh! {{without a}} doubt it was over; she was dead, and these dreams and {{memories}} were such as come to the dwellers in the Under-world. Only <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> she {{hear the sound of}} lapping water, and of dipping oars? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] {{cried the}} girl. [...] "Your own schemes have all failed, you say; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you {{not think of}} {{becoming}} a priest in reality, and getting the good there must be in such a calling? It is singular that I should venture to {{say such a thing}} to you, and it must seem presumptuous and ridiculous for me, a Protestant--but our ways are so different."... She paused, coloring deeply, then controlled herself, and added with grave composure, [...] "If you were to pray"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] said Mrs. Peyton pettishly, [...] "nor do I want to! You know, John, how distasteful and {{unpleasant}} {{it is for}} me to have those dreary, petty, and vulgar details of the poor child's past life recalled, and, thank Heaven, I have forgotten them except when you choose to drag them before me. You agreed, long ago, that we were never to talk of the Indian massacre of her parents, so that we could also ignore it before her; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you talk of her vulgar friends, who are just as unpleasant? Please let us drop the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But was I more {{happy when}} I was drudging? I was not. I was just bedraggled and unhappy. It's work--but not my work. I could run an office or a library, or nurse and teach children. But solitary dish-washing isn't {{enough to satisfy}} me--or many other women. We're going to chuck it. We're going to wash 'em by machinery, and come out and play with you men in the offices and clubs and {{politics}} you've cleverly kept for yourselves! Oh, we're hopeless, we dissatisfied women! <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> {{you want to have}} us about the place, to fret you? So it's for your sake that I'm going!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was much}} {{surprised}} by this explanation, {{and a good deal}} relieved to find that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; but instead of replying, I said, [...] "If it be as you state, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> you take me from my island, and <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you not now take me back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Allie Lee had {{believed}} {{many times that}} her heart was breaking, but now she knew it had never broken till <b>then.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> he not turn to see her waiting there--stricken motionless and voiceless, wild to give the lie to those cold, strange words? ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{as there}} was no answer, he added: [...] "It sounded like Rachel, but it spoke above me. I suppose that she has killed herself. I thought she might, but better {{that she should be}} dead than belong to that fellow. Only <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> she speak?" ...|$|R
