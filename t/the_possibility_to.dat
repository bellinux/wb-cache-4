5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>to</b> mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>to</b> mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E
