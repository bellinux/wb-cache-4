5|$|Blomkvist's {{daughter}} Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him {{and notes}} that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection {{to a series of}} murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.|$|E
5|$|On November 24, 1922, Cather {{wrote to}} a friend, Edwin H. Anderson, {{director}} of the New York Public Library, {{that she was the}} author of the entire book except for the first chapter. Burton J. Hendrick had written the first installment, but it had been based largely on rumor. McClure asked her to complete the series because she was regarded as impartial. For the rest of the installments, she told Anderson, no expense had been spared in verifying Milmine's material. McClure had promoted her to managing editor on the basis of <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> <b>She</b> ended the letter by asking Anderson to keep the information confidential; she added that had not told the truth about it to anyone before this, but felt that someone ought to know.|$|E
5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely {{through the eyes of}} others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Episode III was {{composed}} by Yuki Kajiura. Having previous {{contributed to the}} score of Episode II by composing the cimenatic tracks, Kajiura was brought back to compose the entire score. Despite the increased work load of handling an entire game's soundtrack, Kajiura found the difficulty similar to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> did on Episode II. She drew inspiration from the game's artwork and impression of the setting when creating the score. Takahashi, {{in addition to his}} other roles in production, acted as coordinator for the score. A soundtrack album titled Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, featuring selections from the game's score, was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album's brevity was {{due to the fact that}} the full soundtrack would have taken up six CDs, and so Kajiura was asked by sound producer Keiichi Nozaki to create samples for a two-disc release.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Idaho steamed to Guadalcanal, {{where she}} {{took part in}} amphibious assault training. On 12 September, she steamed to Peleliu and joined the preparatory {{bombardment}} of the island. In the ensuing Battle of Peleliu, dug in Japanese defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the assaulting Marines, with Idaho providing artillery support until 24 September, when she withdrew for an overhaul. She steamed to Manus and then to Bremerton, Washington, arriving on 22 October. During the refit, the 5-inch /25 cal. guns were replaced by ten 5-inch /38 cal. guns in single enclosed mounts; {{she was the only}} ship of her class to receive this modification. The installation of these guns required the removal of the last of the old 5-inch /51 guns, as the new weapons required continuous ammunition hoists. After completion of <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> <b>she</b> conducted training off California. On 28 January 1945, Idaho departed San Diego, bound for Pearl Harbor. There, she joined the bombardment group, which proceeded to the Marianas and then on 14 February steamed north to Iwo Jima, the target of the next major amphibious assault. The ship bombarded the Japanese defenders on 19 February as the Marines went ashore; Idaho remained there for nearly a month before withdrawing on 7 March to replenish at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts was wildly successful, {{shipping}} {{more than}} four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited {{as one of the}} highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time. The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements. Kingdom Hearts was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of Kingdom Hearts in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven Kingdom Hearts games and Nintendo's Mario & Luigi series. She has also worked on many other projects, such as Heroes of Mana and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall. She performed songs from games such as Kingdom Hearts, Live a Live, and Street Fighter II. During the Beware the Forest's Mushrooms performance from Super Mario RPG, Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow game composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who played the Irish bouzouki. She most recently composed and produced the majority of the score for Final Fantasy XV, which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.|$|E

25|$|Rosalind Franklin was a crystallographer, {{whose work}} helped to {{elucidate}} the fine structures of coal, graphite, DNA and viruses. In 1953, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> did on DNA allowed Watson and Crick to conceive their {{model of the}} structure of DNA. Her photograph of DNA gave Watson and Crick a basis for their DNA research, and they were awarded the Nobel Prize without giving due credit to Franklin, who had died of cancer in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{years and}} many awards later, Oates surmised that them and Blonde (2000) were <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> will most be remembered for, and would most {{want a new}} reader to select, though she added that [...] "I could as easily have chosen a number of titles." ...|$|R

50|$|She {{began working}} in William Keith’s {{studio in the}} early 1880s; <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> {{exhibited}} in her first show in 1885 centered on images of the California hills in emulation of her teacher’s style. Throughout her life, she sketched from nature, but finished her paintings back in the studio.|$|R
25|$|Although {{many people}} believe that Krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never stopped {{creating}} art. Throughout her career, she went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> would produce. Because of her self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In 1976-77, {{she went}} to Australia as a visiting Fellow at the Australian National University. There she {{collected}} oral material from those with Scottish connections, some of which {{is included in the}} CD “Chokit on a Tattie” (focussing on children’s songs and rhymes), and in a forthcoming issue of the journal Tochter. In 1977, Lyle donated copies of her tape recordings to the National Library of Australia. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> did as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute of Harvard University in 1974-75 gave her increased visibility as a ballad scholar and led to many more visits to Harvard, including an appointment at the Center for the Study of World Religions in 1995.|$|E
25|$|A story tells {{that after}} the death of Moses de Leon, a rich man of Avila named Joseph offered Moses' widow (who had been left without any means of {{supporting}} herself) a large sum of money for the original from which her husband had made the copy. She confessed that her husband himself was the author of <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> <b>She</b> had asked him several times, she said, why he had chosen to credit his own teachings to another, and he had always answered that doctrines put into the mouth of the miracle-working Shimon bar Yochai would be a rich source of profit. The story indicates that shortly after its appearance the work was believed by some to have been written by Moses de Leon.|$|E
5000|$|Andersons {{style has}} been {{described}} as [...] " ...this most accessible of choreographers (feeds) not on the esoteric and obscure, but on the readily available debris of media culture." [...] <b>The</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> has choreographed have been described as [...] "Political without being dogmatic, irreverent but not lightweight..." ...|$|R
50|$|Monographs by O'Neale include Textile Periods in Ancient Peru (1930), Yurok-Karok Basket Weavers (1932), Papago Color Designations (1943, with Juan Dolores), and Textiles of Highland Guatemala (1945). On both {{historical}} and anthropological topics, {{she was a}} hands-on scholar, determined to recreate the patterns and textures of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> studied.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016, she premiered her new single [...] "Breathe" [...] {{inspired}} by the Black Lives Matter Movement, especially Eric Garner's last words.

25|$|Meyer {{continued}} {{writing to}} the end chronologically, not worrying about the backstory. She lettered the chapters instead of numbering them, Chapter 13 being E. The last chapter of the first draft kept getting longer and longer, so she wrote epilogue after epilogue. However, {{she realized that she}} wanted to explore many of the events in the backstory and the reasons behind the events in the chapters, so she planned to write a 5-6 chapter backstory. Instead, these turned into twelve chapters {{by the time she was}} finished. In a matter of three months she had completed a novel. She has said she was writing for her own enjoyment, never thinking of publishing <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> <b>She</b> finished the manuscript on August 29, 2003.|$|E
25|$|When she {{completed}} the Little Image series in 1949, Krasner again {{went through a}} critical phase with her work. She tried out and rejected many new styles and eventually destroyed most of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> made in the early 1950s. There is evidence that she began experimenting with automatic painting and created black and white hybridized, monstrous figures on large canvases in 1950. These were the paintings that Betty Parsons saw when she visited The Springs that summer, causing Parsons to offer Krasner a show for the fall. Between the summer and the fall, Krasner again had shifted her style to color field painting and destroyed the figurative automatic paintings she made. The Betty Parsons show was the first solo exhibition Krasner displayed her works at since 1945. After the exhibition, Krasner used the color field paintings to make her collage paintings.|$|E
500|$|In 1925, the spectre of {{deportation}} loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named James Colton {{offered to}} marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: [...] "I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling {{to come back here}} from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive." [...] She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> had published in 1914. But the audiences were [...] "awful," [...] and she never finished her second book on the subject.|$|E
50|$|Her spurning of Impressionism {{was more}} than just {{distancing}} herself from the Pissarros. She considered Western art to be in competition with photography, while Eastern art was more suited to her independent nature. She never visited the Far East; her inspiration came solely from <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> had seen in museums and elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{glittering}} genealogy aside, Juliana {{is primarily}} remembered {{as one of}} the first non-reigning female patrons of art in recorded history. From what little we know about her personal predilections, it appears that she [...] "directly intervened in determining the content, as well, perhaps, as the style" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> commissioned.|$|R
25|$|Actual {{knowledge}} of the infringing activity: Wolk argued that her takedown notices imposed a duty on Photobucket to remove all present and future instances of infringement of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> listed. <b>The</b> court disagreed, holding that Photobucket was only required to remove the instances of infringing material that Wolk specifically identified in DMCA-compliant notices.|$|R
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was forced}} to write the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond to Talleyrand and ongoing events. Upon {{completing}} <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> <b>she</b> wrote to her friend William Roscoe: [...] "I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject.– Do not suspect me of false modesty– I {{mean to say that}} had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, {{in every sense of the}} word... I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Stefani {{began working}} on two albums: a follow up to The Sweet Escape, her second solo album, and a new album with her band, No Doubt. [...] Two singles, [...] "Baby Don't Lie", and [...] "Spark the Fire", were {{released}} {{towards the end of}} the year. [...] In August 2015 Stefani filed for divorce from her husband, Gavin Rossdale, after almost thirteen years of marriage, and two months later she revealed that she had scrapped <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> had done for the new album, and started over with fresh material. [...] She began working with Justin Tranter, and Julia Michaels, and after writing several songs dealing with the breakup of her marriage, Stefani began to work on songs inspired by her new relationship with singer Blake Shelton, including [...] "Make Me Like You". The song took shape quickly, in [...] "like, 10, 15 minutes", according to Stefani. [...] The songwriting credit lists Stefani, Tranter and Michaels, and also credits Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson, the producers.|$|E
500|$|She {{has worked}} with UNICEF since 2006, {{recording}} public-service announcements and participating in media panel discussions promoting children's rights and the education of girls, and also participated in celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. She was appointed as the national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights on 10 August 2010. UNICEF Representative Karin Hulshof said of the appointment: [...] "She is equally passionate about her {{work on behalf of}} children and adolescents. We are proud of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>she</b> has done with us so far on child rights, and, we are thrilled about all what we will be doing together so that no child gets left behind." [...] In 2009, she shot a documentary for the organisation Alert India to increase understanding of leprosy. She modelled for designer Manish Malhotra and Shaina NC's charity fashion show to raise funds for the Cancer Patients Aid Association (CPAA) NGO. In 2010 Chopra was one of several celebrities who created promotional messages for Pearls Wave Trust, which campaigns against violence and abuse of women and girls. Chopra also launched the [...] "Save the Girl Child" [...] campaign, which aims to change the attitudes of Indians towards girls. In 2012 Chopra spoke at the launch of Awakening Youth, an anti-addiction programme.|$|E

She also co-wrote two songs for Ashes.|$|R
50|$|Bouras {{published}} {{her first}} book, the autobiographical A Foreign Wife, in 1986. It describes {{her life as}} a foreign wife in Greece, and the challenges she faced in living in Greek culture and society. Most of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>she</b> has published since then, both autobiographical and fiction, explore the themes of exile, cultural identity, and family.|$|R
5000|$|She died of {{undisclosed}} causes, aged 66. According to {{the critic}} Philip Hope-Wallace, Dresdel was [...] "an actress of high definition {{with a real}} power to take an audience by the wrist and give them <b>the</b> <b>works.</b> <b>She</b> had terrific personality and was terribly underused and misused. She {{would have been the}} Lady Macbeth of all Lady Macbeths." ...|$|R
