In 1556 they went to Frankfurt in Germany to escape {{religious}} persecution under Queen Mary I, taking five of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> them. It is unknown whether Lettice was among them, and she may have passed the next few years in the household of Princess Elizabeth with whom the family had a close relationship since the mid-1540s. They returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I's succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} with maternal expressed emotion (EE) towards <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disability (ID). Design and method A total of 33 mothers who had a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ID {{and at least one}} child without disabilities between the ages of 4 and 14 years participated in the study. Mothers completed self-assessment questionnaires which addressed their sense of parenting competence, beliefs about child-rearing practices, and their reports of behavioural and emotional problems of <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ID. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess maternal EE towards the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ID and towards a sibling using the Five Minute Speech Sample (FMSS; Magana et al. 1986), and also to assess the adaptive behaviour of the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ID using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS; Sparrow et al. 1984). Results Mothers with high EE towards <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ID were more satisfied with their parenting ability, and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> had more behaviour problems. Analysis of differential maternal parenting, through comparisons of EE towards <b>their</b> two <b>children,</b> showed that mothers were more negative towards <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ID for all domains of the FMSS except dissatisfaction. Conclusions A small number of {{factors associated with}} maternal EE towards <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ID were identified. Differences in maternal EE towards <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ID and <b>their</b> other <b>child</b> suggest that EE is child-driven rather than a general maternal characteristic. Implications of the data for future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Little is {{currently}} understood {{about the ways}} in which caregivers represent the internal mental states of <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> autism. Previous research has shown that being mind-minded can limit the experience of parenting stress in typically developing samples. The current study explored mind-mindedness in mothers of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and examined whether this related to the experience of parenting stress. Method: Mind-mindedness was coded from mothers’ descriptions of <b>their</b> <b>child</b> obtained from an online survey (N = 55). A subsample of these mothers also provided data on a non-ASD sibling (n = 27). We compared mothers’ mind-mindedness when describing <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD and a non-ASD sibling. Results: Mothers predominantly described <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD using mental and behavioral attributes. There were no overall differences in mothers’ use of mental state descriptors when referring to <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD or a sibling, however, when considering the valence of descriptors, a significantly higher proportion of the mental attributes used to describe the <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD were negative. Associations between mind-mindedness and overall parenting stress failed to reach significance. Conclusions: Parenting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> ASD does not appear to limit the parent’s ability to tune-in to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> mind. Maternal mind-mindedness scores were similar for the ASD and non-ASD sibling, although there were differences in the valence of representations. Being mind-minded did not protect against parenting stress, however we suggest that the high levels of stress experienced by our sample were beyond the protective reach of mind-mindedness...|$|R
5|$|She met Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal in 1949, {{they married}} in December 1950; subsequently, they had five {{children}} together. In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper La Prensa. He took over publishing and under his direction, the paper became a voice of opposition to the Somoza regime. Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for {{the content of the}} paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children. She followed him; if he was forced to leave, she left the children with family and traveled to be with him; if he was jailed, she was reunited with the children and visited him. Chamorro's earnings from a rental property that her mother had given her gave the couple a steady income. When her husband was assassinated on 10 January 1978, she took over control of the newspaper.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Evaluate {{the views}} and knowledge, {{regarding}} dental care, {{of parents who}} have a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome (DS). Methods: Parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> DS were invited to fill in a questionnaire. They were recruited by the Flemish Organization for DS, from schools for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> special needs and by four multidisciplinary medical DS teams at four University Hospitals. Statistics: Chi-square tests were {{used to test the}} correlation between different variables. Results were assessed in the 95 % confidence interval with p< 0. 05. Results: Mean age of the children was 10. 1 years old (SD: 5. 3). Oral health was indicated as rather good by 53 % of the parents. Of the children, 66 % went to a dentist within the last six months. Most of the children (64 %) received a dental examination. In 53 % of the cases, parents visited the same dentist for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> DS as <b>their</b> other <b>child(ren)</b> without DS. Eighty-three percent of the parents are pleased with their dentist. They expect the dentist to be kind and reassuring. Children aged 10 years or younger get significantly more help with tooth brushing (79 %) than children older than 10 years (36 %). However 20 % of the parents never received any oral hygiene instructions for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> DS. Conclusion: Prevention is the most frequent service provided by the dentist.

40|$|<b>Children</b> <b>with</b> special {{health care}} needs {{are one of the}} most {{vulnerable}} groups in the event of an emergency. Natural and manmade disasters or emergency events occur on a daily basis. Government agencies, schools and day care centers have begun developing emergency disaster plans; fewer plans have been developed for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> special needs. One explanation for the lack of specific planning for children is that agencies may believe that plans for adults are not different from plans for children. There may be many reasons why parents who have <b>children</b> <b>with</b> special needs may not have an emergency plan in place. Parents are overwhelmed with the care of <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> special needs and they may have few specific resources to guide them in developing a plan. To identify relevant information on emergency preparedness for parents who have a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> special needs, this researcher conducted a MEDLINE search via PUBMED. The search included the years 1995 to 2008 using the key words <b>children</b> <b>with</b> special needs, disaster planning for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> disabilities, disaster planning, emergency preparedness and parent’s preparation for disasters. Sixty articles and studies were reviewed. Seventeen met the criteria of providing information regarding parent’s preparations and agency’s plans. The results of the research indicate agencies are beginning to develop plans, however, they are lacking for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> special needs. This researcher developed specific guidelines to complement the agency’s plans and to assist parents in creating emergency plans to ensure an improved outcome for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> special needs. Parents planning through compilation of information, construction of an emergency kit and purchase of a medical alert identification will empower them with the feeling of being prepared for events that may occur and help to reduce the potential catastrophic consequences of an emergency for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> special {{health care needs}}...|$|R

40|$|Background Type 1 {{diabetes}} is a chronically disease that often occurs in early life. In every year around 77. 000 {{children in the}} world is estimated with type 1 diabetes. When a child gets a chronically disease it affects the whole family, specially the parents who will be the child's caregiver. Aim The aim {{of this study was to}} describe parents experiences of living <b>with</b> a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> type 1 diabetes. Method A literature review was carried trough based on 10 qualitative scientific articles. The articles were analyzed and two main themes and seven subthemes emerged. Results All parents experienced that they needed some kind of support particularly early in their illness. They felt it was a big responsibility to take care of <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> diabetes and parents often felt anxiety and fear associated with the disease. Not having constant control over <b>their</b> <b>child</b> the parents experienced as a pain. Increased knowledge and experience contributed the parents to feel security and found it easier to manage <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> illness. Conclusion It's normal for parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> a chronical illness to experience different emotions such as anxiety, fear, control needs and guilt. Therefore it's important that health care focuses on supporting and educates parents in caring for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> diabetes...|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} republican {{motherhood}} {{was inspired by}} this period and reflects the importance of Republicanism as the dominant American ideology. It assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Women were considered to have the essential role of instilling <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed {{to the war effort}} through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal care {{also plays}} a role in the health of women and <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>with</b> excess infant {{mortality}} in impoverished populations and nations representing these differentials in health. According to Ward, poverty is the strongest predictor of insufficient prenatal care, which is caused by three factors that reduce access. These include socieodemographic factors (such as age, ethnicity, marital status, and education), systematic barriers, and barriers based on lack of knowledge, attitudes and life-styles. Several studies show the complex associations between poverty and education, employment, teen births, and the health of the mother and child. Sixty percent of children born into poor families have at least one chronic disease. Maternal mortality also takes a toll. In 1985, The World Health Organization estimated that maternal mortality rates were 150 times higher in developing countries than developed nations.|$|E
