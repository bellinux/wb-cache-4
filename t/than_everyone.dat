5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> else in the world.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had more}} {{success in the}} tour matches, taking 85 wickets at 18.37 in all {{first-class}} fixtures. This ranked him third among the Australians in the wicket-taking and fifth in the averages. He bowled more overs <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> but Bill Johnston, allowing Bradman to ease the workload on pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, and conserve their energy for the Tests. Johnson's most successful match with the ball was against Gloucestershire, in which he took match figures of 11/100. He was also more prolific with the bat outside the Tests, scoring 543 runs at 30.16, with a top-score of 113 not out against Somerset. He also made 80 against a Marylebone Cricket Club team that consisted almost entirely of Test players. Johnson was prominent in the field, taking 23 catches, the most by a non-wicket-keeper on tour.|$|E
5|$|Pryce {{started his}} career in Formula One with the small Token team, making his only start for them at the 1974 Belgian Grand Prix. Shortly after an {{impressive}} performance at the Formula Three support race for the 1974 Monaco Grand Prix, Pryce joined the Shadow team and scored his first points in Germany in only his fourth race. Pryce later claimed two podium finishes, his first in Austria in 1975 and the second in Brazil a year later. Pryce was considered by his team as a great wet-weather driver. During the practice session for the 1977 South African Grand Prix, run in wet conditions, Pryce was faster <b>than</b> <b>everyone,</b> including world champion drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt. During the race, he collided at high speed with a safety marshal, Frederik Jansen van Vuuren, and both men were killed. A memorial to Pryce was unveiled in 2009 in his home town of Ruthin.|$|E

5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

He learns that the group will be digging an enormous foundation pit in which they will later construct a housing complex for the country's proletarians. Voschev also works at a slower pace <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> else except for one man, Kozlov, whom the others make fun of for masturbating so often. Safronov, the most politically active worker at the foundation pit, complains when managements tells them to stop working for the day.|$|E

25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
25|$|This {{sentence}} is semantically ambiguous. Specifically, {{it contains a}} scope ambiguity. This ambiguity cannot be resolved at surface structure, since someone, being within the verb phrase, must be lower in the structure <b>than</b> <b>everyone.</b> This case exemplifies the general fact that natural language is insufficiently specified for strict logical meaning. Robert May argued for the postulation of LF partly in order to account for such ambiguities (among other motivations). At LF, the sentence above would have two possible structural representations, one for each possible scope-reading, in order {{to account for the}} ambiguity by structural differentiation. In this way it is similar in purpose to, but not the same as, logical form in logic.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle {{was the son}} of a French {{physician}} and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching, was mixed towards [...] "Of Vice and Men", writing that the episode's {{focus on the}} mystery of the week did not work thematically, as Veronica did not have a stake in its solving. [...] "The better we get to know the {{supporting}} characters and the closer each arc gets to its conclusion, the harder it gets to care about stories that don't have a really personal connection for Veronica." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was very critical of the episode, naming five ways in which he thought Veronica was unlikable in the episode. [...] "Simply put, Veronica spends most of [...] "Of Vice and Men" [...] acting like she's better and smarter <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> else. Of course, she is smarter <b>than</b> <b>everyone,</b> so that's okay. But better? Sometimes that's justified, sometimes it's not," [...] elaborating that Veronica became increasingly unlikeable in the episode. He was also negative towards the final sequence, writing [...] "it feels slightly manipulative," [...] commenting that the show was not ready to tackle scenes of attempted rape.|$|E

After each song she would clap and whistle louder <b>than</b> <b>everyone</b> else and was seen [...] "swaying and dancing" [...] throughout the whole concert.
