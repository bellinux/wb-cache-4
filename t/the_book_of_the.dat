5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema.

5|$|At night, Evelyn takes <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead {{and reads}} a page aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows {{them with the}} help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead brought Imhotep back to life, <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead was updated, {{revised and}} standardised.

In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity.

5|$|Most {{owners of}} <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead were evidently {{part of the}} social elite; they were {{initially}} reserved for the royal family, but later papyri are found in the tombs of scribes, priests and officials. Most owners were men, and generally the vignettes included the owner's wife as well. Towards the beginning of the history of <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead, there are roughly 10 copies belonging to men for every one for a woman. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, 2/3 were for women; and women owned roughly a third of the hieratic paypri from the Late and Ptolemaic Periods.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead first {{developed}} in Thebes toward {{the beginning of}} the Second Intermediate Period, around 1700 BCE. The earliest known occurrence of the spells included in <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead is from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, of the 13th dynasty, where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead {{was part}} of a {{tradition}} of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the spells included were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which made up the Book continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as had always been the spells from which they originated. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|The New Kingdom saw <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead {{develop and}} spread further.

From this period onward <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead was {{typically}} written on a papyrus scroll, and the text illustrated with vignettes.

5|$|The {{existence}} of <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead {{was known as}} early as the Middle Ages, well before its contents could be understood.

5|$|There was {{no single}} or {{canonical}} Book of the Dead. The surviving papyri contain a varying selection {{of religious and}} magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration.
