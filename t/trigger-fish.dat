50|$|Many of {{the reports}} of fish preying on Acanthaster are single {{observations}} or presumed predation from {{the nature of the}} fish. For example, the humphead wrasse may prey on the starfish amongst its more usual diet. Individual puffer fish and <b>trigger-fish</b> have been observed to feed crown-of-thorns starfish in the Red Sea, but {{there is no evidence that}} they are a significant factor in population control. A study, however, based on the stomach contents of large carnivorous fish that are potential predators of the starfish found no evidence of the starfish in the fish's guts. These carnivorous fish were caught commercially on the coral reefs on the Gulf of Oman and examined at local fish markets.|$|E
40|$|The <b>trigger-fish</b> {{dentition}} is polyphyodont, with attachment by a periodontal ligament {{similar to}} the periodontium found in mammals, the teeth thus having a longer functional life and a slower rate of development and eruption than is seen in many fish. Histological studies reveal that balistid dentin begins development prior to {{the appearance of the}} initial enamel matrix. The reactions to a battery of stains exhibited by the dentin and the enamel matrix are indistinguishable from those seen in the developing teeth of amphibians, reptiles and mammals. In the balistids, the enamel matrix is a product of columnar ameloblasts and is an 2 ̆ 2 ectodermal enamel 2 ̆ 2 rather than a 2 ̆ 2 mesodermal enamel 2 ̆ 2 as has been described in other osseous fish...|$|E
40|$|Sections of {{the matrix}} of {{developing}} dentin and enamel from the foetal pig, alligator lizard, bullfrog and <b>trigger-fish</b> were examined with scanning electron microscopy. The major difference {{appears to be in}} the number and size of the tubules that permeate the matrices. The pre-dentin matrix is a loose meshwork of fibrillae surrounding the area of the dentinal tubules. The older circumpulpal dentin intertubular matrix is fibrillar, with the interstices {{of the matrix}} filled with an amorphous ground substance. The enamel organic matrix has a fibrillar appearance, with no evidence of rod structure being seen. Observed for the first time is an apparent system of microtubiculi with diameters of about 0. 2 µ permeating the enamel matrix. Such a system of microtubiculi would provide a pathway for diffusion of inorganic salts and for the removal of soluble organic material during amelogenesis. The similarity of development and structure in amphibians and reptiles suggests the possibility of utilizing these animals in experimental mineralization studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of a general {{investigation}} of the optic system in some <b>trigger-fishes,</b> a hypothalamic, ventricular channel-system with pores, leading to the outside of the brain, has been discovered in the inferior lobes ofRhinecanthus aculeatus (Balistidae). A description of the morphological relations of the channel-system to the blood-vessel-supply and the cranium suggests that the organ-systems involved form a functional unit. The possibility of a hormone-producing system is discussed in the light of physiological and ecological aspects. ...|$|R
