40|$|Supervised {{approaches}} to Relation Extraction (RE) {{are characterized by}} higher accuracy than unsupervised models. Unfortunately, their applicability is limited by <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data for each relation type. Automatic creation of such data using Distant Supervision (DS) provides a promising solution to the problem. In this paper, we study DS for designing endto-end systems of sentence-level RE. In particular, we propose a joint model between Web data derived with DS and manually annotated data from ACE. The results show (i) an improvement on the previous state-of-the-art in ACE, which provides important evidence of the benefit of DS; and (ii) a rather good accuracy on extracting 52 types of relations from Web data, which suggests the applicability of DS for general RE. ...|$|E

This paper presents the sequential Gaussian simulation in geostatistics for measuring signal and noise variances in images without <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data for the BLUE filter implementation. The simulated signal variance and the BLUE average can be further used as parameters of the adaptive Wiener filter for image restoration...|$|E
