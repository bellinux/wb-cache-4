5|$|Szigeti {{was also}} the dedicatee {{of the first of}} Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's {{inspiration}} to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> as a modern counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Both {{entrance}}s {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind in the subway system. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to stand out aesthetically. The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance wedged between 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|Ng's main {{characters}} are generally female. These characters {{generally do not}} hold the same employment; some occupations held by her characters include office worker, animal nursery employee, and automotive repair shop owner. Her children's stories are written simply, illustrated, and deal with children's feelings; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to give children more empathy. The characters' names are chosen {{to be easy to}} remember.|$|E

5|$|Smart's Hymns {{are one of}} {{the first}} works of hymns {{dedicated}} to children, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to teach Christian virtues. Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum, such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs, this work was a success and went into many immediate editions. Part of the success of this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text. However, Smart died before he ever saw the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book's success.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} Holkham {{were of a}} large central block of two floors only, {{containing}} on the piano nobile level a series of symmetrically balanced state rooms situated around two courtyards. No hint of these courtyards is given externally; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings, and at each corners {{is linked to the}} main house not by long colonnadesas would have been the norm in Palladian architecturebut by short two-storey wings of only one bay.|$|E
5|$|Both B.s. var.collina and var.spinulosa are {{commonly}} seen in nurseries; {{given that the}} varieties can hybridise, attempting to find a local provenance form from a local community nursery, Bushcare or Australian Plants Society group is preferable environmentally if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> for planting in gardens near bushland where native populations occur. There are some dwarf forms available for the city gardener – 'Stumpy Gold' {{is a form of}} variety collina originally from the Central Coast, while 'Birthday Candles', 'Coastal Cushion' and 'Golden Cascade' are forms of variety spinulosa from the South Coast of New South Wales.|$|E

5000|$|Sponsored Academies {{typically}} replaced {{one or more}} existing schools, {{but some}} <b>were</b> newly established. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> {{to address the problem}} of entrenched failure within English schools with low academic achievement, or schools situated in communities with low academic aspirations. Often these schools had been placed in [...] "special measures" [...] after an Ofsted inspection. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> expected to be creative and innovative because of their financial and academic freedoms, in order to deal with the long-term issues <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to solve.|$|R
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to support.|$|E
25|$|The {{descriptions}} are all excellent, as are {{the line}} drawings and range maps. The photos are true to color, sharply printed, {{and for the most}} part show what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> {{to support}} German naval units {{away from their}} home ports. The ships carry fuel, , {{ammunition}} and other matériel and also provide medical services. The ships are named after German cities where German parliaments were placed.|$|E

25|$|NEMA L6 {{connectors}} {{are rated}} for 250V. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> for two-pole, three wire hot-hot-ground circuits with a nominal supply voltage of 240 or 208V, depending on phase configuration. The L6 connector {{does not provide}} a neutral connection.|$|E
25|$|Each meal {{provides}} about 1200Calories (5020.8kJ). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to {{be eaten}} for a maximum of 21 days (the assumption is that logistics units can provide fresh food rations by then), and have a minimum shelf life of three years (depending on storage conditions).|$|E
25|$|Service uniforms are the U.S. Navy's daily wear uniforms, and {{exist in}} several variations. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> {{for use in}} office environments, in {{positions}} that interact with the public, and in watch situations. Skirts are authorized for women in all service uniforms.|$|E
5000|$|Physiological-impairment noise. Physical {{maladies}} {{that prevent}} effective communication, such as actual deafness or blindness preventing messages from being received as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For some chorale cantatas, {{written from}} 1728 to 1735, {{it is not}} known for which {{occasion}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> written, and whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to belong to a cycle: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> as mixed-traffic locomotives, hauling parcels, freight {{and also}} {{passenger}} trains, usually on routes that included some non-electrified sections, such as boat trains.|$|R
25|$|Booster packs add a {{significant}} amount of content to the game, but are different from expansion packs because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to add to the original gameplay and not stand on their own (such as Special Forces does). The booster packs include new maps, vehicles, and a new European Union faction.|$|E
25|$|Anderson intends the axioms of transreal {{arithmetic}} {{to complement}} the axioms of standard arithmetic; {{they are supposed to}} produce the same result as standard arithmetic for all calculations where standard arithmetic defines a result. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to define a consistent numeric result for the calculations which are undefined in standard arithmetic, such as division by zero.|$|E
25|$|Non-circulating {{legal tender}} (NCLT) are coins which are legal tender, {{and thus can}} in theory be used to {{purchase}} goods or services, but are {{not intended to be}} used in such a manner.

25|$|Ulu, also Eskimo {{knife or}} woman's knife (uluaq in Yup'ik, kegginalek in Cup'ik, ulluar in Cup'ig) is multi-functional {{semilunar}} woman's knife. Ulus {{are made in}} different sizes depending upon the task for which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended.</b> They are used for {{a broad range of}} jobs such as skinning and butchering carcasses, removing fat from skins, preparing meals, cutting skins for skin boats, and collecting shoe grass, as well as far sewing clothing and footwear.|$|E
25|$|Three Fiat-built 'Littorina' railcars {{survived the}} civil war and two are in working order. They are Art Deco in style, with large Fiat {{radiators}} on the front. The bodies are painted in creamy white with grey underneath and roofs with red 'bumpers' on the ends and a red stripe separating the body color from the grey below. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> for tourist service; new vehicles will be built or bought for regular passenger service.|$|E
25|$|Most shellcodes {{are written}} {{without the use}} of null bytes because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> to be {{injected}} into a target process through null-terminated strings. When a null-terminated string is copied, it will be copied up to and including the first null but subsequent bytes of the shellcode will not be processed. When shellcode that contains nulls is injected in this way, only part of the shellcode would be injected, making it incapable of running successfully.|$|E
