5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons,</b> the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed {{almost half a century}} later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of the}} Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} physical {{interpretation of}} the partial detachment of <b>the</b> membrane <b>skeleton</b> in <b>the</b> budding region of the cell membrane and consequent depletion of <b>the</b> membrane <b>skeleton</b> in red blood cell vesicles is given. The red blood cell membrane is considered to consist of the bilayer part and <b>the</b> membrane <b>skeleton.</b> <b>The</b> <b>skeleton</b> is, under normal conditions, bound to the bilayer over its whole area. It is shown that, when in such conditions {{it is in the}} expanded state, some cell shape changes can induce its partial detachment. The partial detachment of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> from <b>the</b> bilayer is energetically favorable if the consequent decrease of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> expansion energy is larger than the corresponding increase of the bilayer-skeleton binding energy. The effect of shape on <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> detachment is analyzed theoretically for a series of the pear class shapes, having decreasing neck diameter and ending with a parent-daughter pair of spheres. The partial detachment of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> is promoted by narrowing of the cell neck, by increasing the lateral tension in <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> and its area expansivity modulus, and by diminishing the attraction forces between <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> and <b>the</b> bilayer. If the radius of the daughter vesicle is sufficiently small relative to the radius of the parent cell, the daughter vesicle can exist either completely underlaid with <b>the</b> <b>skeleton</b> or completely depleted of <b>the</b> <b>skeleton...</b>|$|R

5|$|Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were {{probably}} social {{and lived in}} matriarchal (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also {{similar to that of}} modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as the Dent Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a flash flood, and that the arrangement of some of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of <b>the</b> <b>skeletons.</b> The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may have approached the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. <b>The</b> <b>skeletons</b> of humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, historians {{tended to}} think ancient Egypt {{was the site}} of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian {{paintings}} about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, contained <b>the</b> <b>skeletons,</b> laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat, rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the Fertile Crescent {{around the time of the}} development of agriculture, and then were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were that the family was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or {{as one of the}} most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken.

5|$|During {{the late}} Jurassic, Europe was a dry, {{tropical}} archipelago {{at the edge}} of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which <b>the</b> <b>skeletons</b> of Compsognathus have been found originated in calcite from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where Compsognathus specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of Compsognathus longipes include the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica and the pterosaurs Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Pterodactylus antiquus. The same sediments in which Compsognathus have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with Compsognathus, indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.|$|E
