5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before <b>tucking</b> inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed {{that it was time for}} a new opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after <b>tucking</b> Cena's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E

25|$|When Australia batted, Lawry, their stumbling-block-extraordinary, took root, {{and in an}} interminable left-handed {{stand with}} Cowper {{effectively}} droused English prospects. When this relentless fellow, having reached his sixth Test hundred against England, at length took a liberty he had made 592 runs in the Tests, average 84, the highest aggregate since Bradman's in 1946–47: not only that, he had scored 979 against M. J. K. Smith's side since they landed in Perth, and had occupied the crease for forty-one and a half hours. There was a gayer side to Lawry as we had seen at Adelaide—but he didn't let it obtrude too often.

500|$|Lead artist Arnold Tsang recounted {{that the}} body size, {{as well as the}} running pose of a character, were both {{characteristics}} that were considered during character design in order to make each one identifiable. Tracer, for instance, has a wild running animation, in addition to a unique trail of blue light, which follows behind her. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku commented that her jump animation appears [...] "hyper-exaggerated and kinda goofy looking". This {{is a result of the}} smear frame, combined with squash and stretch animation techniques, implemented in Overwatch. With respect to Tracer, Blizzard senior animator David Gibson pointed out frames from her jump animation, stating, [...] "we're trying to just push it a little further than normal. Something as simple as stretching the torso out, having her hang [...] just a little bit longer than normal. Really squashing her when she lands. Her head is <b>tucking</b> in. Everything is supporting this basic principle of squash and stretch in a gameplay asset." ...|$|E

Brian Lowry of Variety said that Spader was the only actor [...] "that lifts The Blacklist above mundane", saying that Spader did not get enough screen time.

50|$|A classic <b>Tuck</b> is {{one that}} was {{primarily}} used in the 1980s and 90s. However some modern events, such as the MT Tabor Challenge in Portland Oregon, require this <b>tuck</b> to increase the difficulty on mellow hills. The <b>tuck</b> involves placing both feet {{at the front of}} the board, touching with one foot slightly behind the other. The rider then crouches down somewhat similar to a modern <b>tuck.</b> This <b>tuck</b> provides a severely reduced amount of control due to the rider having minimal control over the rear trucks. Further the stance has higher aerodynamic drag than other <b>tucks.</b>|$|R
500|$|Skelton {{was unable}} to work in {{television}} {{until the end of}} his 1951 MGM movie contract; a renegotiation to extend the pact provided permission after that point. He signed a contract for television on NBC with Procter and Gamble as his sponsor on May 4, 1951, and said he would be performing the same characters on television as he had been doing on radio. The MGM agreement with Skelton for television performances did not allow him to go on the air before September 30, 1951. His television debut, The Red Skelton Show, premiered on that date: {{at the end of his}} opening monologue, two men backstage grabbed his ankles from behind the set curtain, hauling him offstage face down. [...] A 1943 instrumental hit by David Rose, called [...] "Holiday for Strings", became Skelton's TV theme song. [...] The move to television allowed him to create two non-human characters, seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe, which he performed while the pair were flying by <b>tucking</b> his thumbs under his arms to represent wings and shaping his hat to look like a bird's bill. He patterned his meek, henpecked television character of George Appleby after his radio character, J. Newton Numbskull, who had similar characteristics. His [...] "Freddie the Freeloader" [...] clown was introduced on the program in 1952, with Skelton copying his father's makeup for the character. [...] He learned how to duplicate his father's makeup and perform his routines through his mother's recollections. [...] A ritual became established at the end of every program, with Skelton's shy boyish wave and words of, [...] "Good night and may God bless." ...|$|E
500|$|The 9th century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical {{discussion of}} instruments cited the lyra (lūrā) as the typical {{instrument of the}} Byzantines along with the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the salandj (probably a bagpipe). The first of these, the early bowed stringed instrument known as the Byzantine lyra, would {{come to be called}} the lira da braccio, in Venice, where it is considered by many to have been the predecessor of the contemporary violin, which later flourished there. The bowed [...] "lyra" [...] is still played in former Byzantine regions, where it is known as the Politiki lyra (lit. [...] "lyra of the City" [...] i.e. Constantinople) in Greece, the Calabrian lira in Southern Italy, and the Lijerica in Dalmatia. The second instrument, the organ, originated in the Hellenistic world (see Hydraulis) and was used in the Hippodrome during races. [...] A pipe organ with [...] "great leaden pipes" [...] was sent by the emperor Constantine V to Pepin the Short, King of the Franks in 757. [...] Pepin's son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning its establishment in Western church music. The final Byzantine instrument, the aulos was a double reeded woodwind like the modern oboe or Armenian duduk. Other forms include the plagiaulos (πλαγίαυλος, from πλάγιος [...] "sideways"), which resembled the flute, and the askaulos (ἀσκός askos – wine-skin), a bagpipe. These bagpipes, also known as Dankiyo (from ancient Greek: angion (Τὸ ἀγγεῖον) [...] "the container"), had been played even in Roman times. Dio Chrysostom wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe (tibia, Roman reedpipes similar to Greek aulos) with his mouth as well as by <b>tucking</b> a bladder beneath his armpit. The bagpipes continued to be played throughout the empire's former realms through to the present.
