2500|$|Paisley helped {{organize}} further night-time rallies on 1 April, where {{large groups of}} men brandished more pieces of paper. They were held on hillsides near Gortin, Armagh and Newry. At Gortin, the police were attacked and two police vehicles overturned. On 16 November, Paisley addressed a large Third Force rally in Enniskillen, where hundreds of men marched {{in a show of}} strength. Paisley organized a loyalist 'Day of Action' on 23 November, to pressure the British government to take a harder line against the IRA. Rallies were held in Protestant areas of Northern Ireland and a number of businesses shut. The DUP and UUP held separate rallies at Belfast City Hall. That night, Paisley addressed a Third Force rally in Newtownards, where thousands of masked and uniformed men marched before him. He declared:My men are ready to be recruited under the crown to destroy the vermin of the IRA.

2500|$|During 1981, the DUP {{opposed the}} then-ongoing talks between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey. That year, Paisley and other DUP members {{attempted}} {{to create a}} Protestant loyalist volunteer militia—called the (Ulster) Third Force—which would work alongside the police and army to fight the Irish Republican Army (IRA). They organized large rallies where men were photographed in military formation waving firearms certificates. Paisley declared: [...] "This is a small token {{of the men who}} are placed to devastate any attempt by Margaret Thatcher and Charles Haughey to destroy the Union". The DUP helped organize a loyalist 'Day of Action' on 23 November 1981, to pressure the British government to take a harder line against the IRA.

2500|$|Johnson gave {{a congressional}} speech—Dallek {{considers}} it his greatest—in {{which he said}} [...] "rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself…rarely are we met with the challenge… to the values and the purposes {{and the meaning of}} our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> failed as a people and as a nation." [...] In 1965, he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time. In accordance with the act, several states, [...] "seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy" [...] (Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia) were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965 while Texas, home to the majority of the African American population at the time, followed in 1975. The Senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77-19 just after 2 1/2 months and won passage in the house in July, by 333–85. The results were significant—between the years of 1968 and 1980, the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. The act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally—in 1965, a few hundred black office-holders mushroomed to 6,000 in 1989.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{defends the}} ideal of toleration as against {{familiar}} criticisms coming from opposing directions. The "illiberal" objection argues that toleration is too permissive. Given the choice, why should we knowingly put up with error? The "ultraliberal" objection, reflected among others places in current free speech and religion clause jurisprudence, complains that "mere" toleration is condescending and illiberal because it declines to treat ideas and persons with equal concern and respect. This essay argues that both sorts of objections are misconceived and that if the valued liberal commitments of the American constitutional tradition are to be maintained, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> necessarily <b>have</b> to embrace an ideal of toleration. The essay further argues that a renewed commitment to toleration is especially imperative {{at the present time}} as we try to cope, internally, with an exhausted ultraliberal discourse reflected in increasingly ineffectual Supreme Court opinions and, externally, with a so-called "clash of civilizations" or cultures that calls upon us to defend our central values rather than complacently pretend to rest in an "overlapping consensus" that needs no more foundational justification. ...|$|R

40|$|Udgivelsesdato: 2003 Starting from Barry Buzan and Richard Little's recent {{assertion}} in Millennium that ‘international relations {{has failed}} {{as an intellectual}} project', I argue that if the study of international political theory is to learn anything from this failure, it {{is the need for}} a conversation that encourages heterologue. If such a conversation is to be of any value at all then it needs to escape the binary dualisms or ‘debates' that are too often said to characterise the discipline of International Relations (IR). Instead, I argue that a reformulated English School (ES) could serve as a medium for such a conversation, providing that the missing tradition of Nietzschean Relativism is included in the heterologue. The inclusion of postmodern insights encourages us to acknowledge that states (and therefore also the idea of ‘international') are important fictions which rest on a world imagination. Finally, I argue that if we seek to overcome the failure of IR and engage in a conversation about international political theory that includes the missing tradition, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> also <b>have</b> to acknowledge that a reformulated ES should better be understood as ‘Extranational Studies'...|$|R
