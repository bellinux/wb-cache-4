40|$|The {{south-western}} part of Croatia, i. e. {{the area}} of central Istria (the research area, approximately 500 km 2) is characterized by flysch complex with {{a great number of}} isolated relief landforms – <b>badlands.</b> <b>The</b> importance of <b>badlands</b> (areas with sparse or no vegetation) is {{in the fact that the}} sediment production from these areas is 8000 higher than from the areas with vegetation. In this paper <b>the</b> <b>badland</b> inventory for <b>the</b> area of research is presented with 5568 badlands (polygons) singled out with total badland area of 10. 7 km 2. Spatial analysis of <b>the</b> <b>badland</b> inventory showed that concentrated erosive channel flow at steep slope foot is the most important factor in <b>the</b> <b>badland</b> forming and development for {{the area of}} central Istria...|$|R

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Kameo {{advances}} through a castle—with {{the help of}} three elemental powers—to rescue her family. As the tutorial prologue ends, Kameo loses her elemental powers and is ejected from the castle into the Enchanted Kingdom to grow stronger and try again. Kameo travels through four themed worlds (water, ice, fire, and swamp) at the outskirts of <b>the</b> <b>Badlands,</b> the overworld that connects the areas. Each of the worlds are interspersed with townsfolk and combat-oriented puzzles. Kameo can either travel to the worlds through <b>the</b> <b>Badlands,</b> where the elves and trolls skirmish, or warp from the Enchanted Kingdom. A help system built into the game provides hints or direct solutions for struggling players. Throughout the kingdom, Kameo finds and defeats the seven shadow creatures each guarding one of her elemental powers, while saving her family earning the other 3.|$|E

5|$|The Nokota {{horse is}} a feral and semi-feral horse breed located in <b>the</b> <b>badlands</b> of southwestern North Dakota in the United States.

The Nokota was almost wiped out during the early 20th century when ranchers, in cooperation with state and federal agencies, worked together to reduce competition for livestock grazing.

Smaller sub-regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies, Coteau du Missouri, James River Valley, the Dissected Till Plains, and <b>the</b> <b>Badlands.</b> Geologic formations in South Dakota range in age from two billion-year-old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to glacial till deposited over the last few million years.
