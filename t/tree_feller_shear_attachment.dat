40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{clinical}} characteristics of hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) {{in a group of}} <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> in a tropical environment. We examined all <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> and se-lected control subjects in a logging camp of central Sarawak for vibration exposure and presence of HAVS symptoms utilizing vibrotactile perception threshold test (VPT) and cold water provocation test (CWP). None of the subjects reported white finger. The <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> reported significantly higher prevalence of finger coldness as compared to the control subjects (OR= 10. 32, 95 %CI= 1. 21 – 87. 94). A lower finger skin temperature, longer fingernail capillary return time and higher VPT were ob-served among the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> as compared to the control subjects in all fingers (effect size> 0. 5). The VPT following CWP of the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> was significantly higher (repeated measures ANOVA p= 0. 002, partial η 2 = 0. 196) than the control subject.

40|$|The {{evidence}} on {{hand-arm vibration syndrome}} (HAVS) in tropical environments is limited. The legislation for the control of occupational vibration exposure {{has yet to be}} established in Malaysia. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the clinical characteristics of HAVS in a tropical environment in comparison with a temperate environment. Methods: We conducted a series medical examinations among the forestry, construction and automobile industry workers in Malaysia adopting the compulsory medical examination procedure used by Wakayama Medical University for Japanese vibratory tools workers. We matched the duration of vibration exposure and compared our results against the Japanese workers. We also compared the results of the Malaysian <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> against a group of symptomatic Japanese <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> diagnosed with HAVS. Results: Malaysian subjects reported a similar prevalence of finger tingling, numbness and dullness (Malaysian= 25. 0, Japanese= 21. 5, p= 0. 444) but had a lower finger skin temperature (FST) and higher vibrotactile perception threshold (VPT) values as compared with the Japanese workers. No white finger was reported in Malaysian subjects. The FST and VPT of the Malaysian <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> were at least as bad as the Japanese <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> despite a shorter duration (mean difference= 20. 12 years, 95 Cl= 14. 50, 25. 40) of vibration exposure. Conclusions: Although the vascular disorder does not manifest clinically in the tropical environment, the severity of HAVS can be as bad as in the temperate environment with predominantly neurological disorder. Hence, it is essential to formulate national legislation for the control of the occupational vibration exposure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple method to {{fabricate}} Janus-faced nanopillars showing the direction-sensitive {{behavior as a}} dry adhesive. Polymeric nanopillars were first molded from an etched SiO 2 substrate containing high aspect ratio nanoholes, followed by the oblique metal deposition on polymer nanopillars such that metal layers in different thicknesses were selectively deposited only {{on one side of}} the nanopillars. We found that the Janus nanopillars show the asymmetric adhesion behavior: it exhibits the strong <b>shear</b> <b>attachment</b> when pulled from a polymer contact (∼ 20 N/cm 2) compared with the relatively weak adhesion when pulled from a metal layer in contact with a glass substrate (∼ 10 N/cm 2). The difference in the shear adhesion strength is believed to originate from different interfacial adhesions between different sides of the Janus nanopillars and a target substrate. In addition, the Janus nanopillars could be further allowed to bend by thermal annealing or E-beam irradiation. The bending mechanism for nanopillars bending toward the metal layer by thermal annealing can be explained by the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between metal and polymer, followed by the plastic deformation of polymeric pillars. What is strikingly interesting is the fact that these bent Janus nanopillars show even greater adhesion hysteresis: the strong <b>shear</b> <b>attachment</b> when pulled from the bent direction (∼ 31 N/cm 2) in contrast to the easy detachment from the opposite direction (∼ 4. 1 N/cm 2) just like gecko-like adhesives.

40|$|SUMMARY Constrictive {{pericarditis}} and pyopericardium with tamponade in {{a patient}} with rheu-matoid arthritis is described. No fever was recorded despite a litre of pus in the pericardial sac, perhaps because of previous treatment with hydrocortisone. Echocardiography is a diagnostic advance. Pericarditis is the commonest cardiac manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. It may present as 'dry' pericarditis with a friction rub and only rarely with tamponade (Kirk and Cosh, 1969). Pyopericardium is extremely rare, and we can find no previous account of pyopericardium with tamponade in association with rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple yet robust method for {{fabricating}} angled, hierarchically patterned high-aspect-ratio polymer nanohairs to generate directionally sensitive dry adhesives. The slanted polymeric nanostructures were molded from an etched polySi substrate containing slanted nanoholes. An angled etching technique {{was developed to}} fabricate slanted nanoholes with flat tips by inserting an etch-stop layer of silicon dioxide. This unique etching method was equipped with a Faraday cage system to control the ion-incident angles in the conventional plasma etching system. The polymeric nanohairs were fabricated with tailored leaning angles, sizes, tip shapes, and hierarchical structures. As a result of controlled leaning angle and bulged flat top of the nanohairs, the replicated, slanted nanohairs showed excellent directional adhesion, exhibiting strong <b>shear</b> <b>attachment</b> (≈ 26 N/cm 2 in maximum) in the angled direction and easy detachment (≈ 2. 2 N/cm 2) in the opposite direction, with a hysteresis value of ≈ 10. In addition to single scale nanohairs, monolithic, micro-nanoscale combined hierarchical hairs were also fabricated by using a 2 -step UV-assisted molding technique. These hierarchical nanoscale patterns maintained their adhesive force even on a rough surface (roughness < 20 μm) because {{of an increase in}} the contact area by the enhanced height of hierarchy, whereas simple nanohairs lost their adhesion strength.

40|$|Plots and {{plantations}} Cue: In Nigeria, government forest {{officers are}} responsible for most forest management. Local people are, however, given access to forests and forest products, and are also issued plots of land within forests reserves for cultivation of crops. Revenues are paid to the state forest departments for these activities. It is also common for state authorities to make forest land available to commercial companies for production of cash crops, such as palm oil and rubber. However, some of these policies have been criticised for causing {{the destruction of the}} natural forests. To find out how forest management could be improved, Tunde Fatunde spoke to Ebohon Clifford Afehodyon, assistant forest superintendent at the Nigerian Forestry Institute in Ibadan, who is responsible for co-ordinating forest guards and officers {{in the southern part of}} the country. He began by asking about the current level of involvement for local communities in forest management. IN:		?There is no community managed ? OUT:		? conservation of the ecosystem. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 13 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ebohon Clifford Afehodyon, with some suggestions for how forests could be better conserved in Nigeria. Transcript Afehodyon	There is no community managed forest reserve in the southern part of Nigeria. However, government provides forest officers for managing such forests. They work in collaboration with local communities, and the results in most cases are usually not too bad. Forest guards ensure that economic trees are not illegally taken away. The forest officers on the other hand, see to the day-to-day running of the forest, including collection of revenues. Fatunde	How would you from experience describe the attitude of local communities towards government supervision of forest reserves? Afehodyon	Local communities are well disposed towards government supervision, because of what they have at stake. The forest reserves are the source of their livelihood. It provides jobs for surrounding communities; it provides food, fuelwood, medicines, craft materials, and building materials. Fatunde	From your own experience, what kind of complaints are lodged by local communities on how these forest resources are being managed? Afehodyon	The communities complain about some aspects of the usage of the forests, especially the establishment of rubber and oil palm tree plantations, within the forest enclave. These cash crops prevent the local communities from obtaining other benefits from the forest, such as bushmeat, medicinal herbs, and firewood. Another source of complaint is the malaise of illegal <b>tree</b> <b>fellers,</b> because they perceive these activities as a threat to their livelihood. Fatunde	Faced with the growing destruction of forest reserves in the south western part of Nigeria, what kind of policies should be put in place by the government in order to conserve the ecosystem in these forest reserves? Afehodyon	First and foremost, the government should ensure that the present policy of giving out forest reserves to companies to establish cash crops should be discouraged, because they give rise to deforestation. Secondly, the present policy of allocating between 1. 2 and 2. 0 hectares of land per household, for farming purposes, should be reduced by about 50 %, so as to check deforestation within forest reserves. And thirdly, the efforts of the Nigerian Conservation Fund (NCF), should be encouraged and complemented by various state governments, and other NGOs that are concerned with conservation of the ecosystem. End of track. A forest superintendent from Nigeria explains how policy needs to change in order to reduce the amount of natural forest that is lost to cash crop plantations and agriculture...|$|R

In this study, we utihzed a Fowler Cell Adhesion Mea-surement Module to demonstrate hat the changes in cellular concentration and composition of a monoculture of Pseudomonas atlantica biofilms on stainless teel were a function of the applied shear force. At shear forces in the range of 3 - 10 dynes cm- 2 (1. 0 liter min-m), attachment as measured by acridine orange direct microscopic ounts was greatest at the higher shear forces. ~ 4 C-Acetate uptake activity on the stainless teel surfaces increased with shear stress. Acetate incorporation ranged from 1 x 10 - 5 to 19 x 10 - 3 /~mol cm- 2 between 0. 15 and 30 dynes cm- 2 for 30 min uptake periods. On a per cell basis, however, activity decreased with shear, indi-cating a shift in metabolism. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy re-vealed that protein and carbohydrate concentrations also increased with the applied shear. Increased biofilm C:N ratios and total fatty acids were associated with the higher shear stresses.

The purpose of this investigation is to help build an in-depth experimental database for this canonical flow configuration that embodies the effects of component interaction in landing gear noise. This new set of measurements augments the previous database at the primary Reynolds number (based on tunnel speed and cylinder diameter) of 1. 66 × 105 in four important respects. First, better circumferential resolution of surface pressure fluctuations is obtained via cylinder “clocking”. Second, higher resolution particle image velocimetry measurements of the shear layer separating from the cylinders are achieved. Third, the effects of simultaneous boundary layer trips along both {{the front and rear}} cylinders, versus front cylinder alone in the previous measurements, are studied. Lastly, on-surface and off-surface characteristics of unsteady flow near the “critical ” cylinder spacing, wherein the flow switches intermittently between two states that are characteristic of lower and higher spacings, are examined. This critical spacing occurs {{in the middle of a}} relatively sudden change in the drag of either cylinder and is characterized by a loud intermittent noise and a flow behavior that randomly transitions between <b>shear</b> layer <b>attachment</b> to the rear cylinder and constant shedding and rollup in front of it.

40|$|AbstractQuantitative {{information}} about adhesion strength {{is a fundamental}} part of our understanding of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Adhesion assays should measure integrin-ECM bond strength, but reports now suggest that cell components remain behind after exposure to acute force for radial shear assays {{in the presence of}} divalent cations that increase integrin-ECM affinity. Here, we show that focal adhesion proteins FAK, paxillin, and vinculin but not the cytoskeletal protein actin remain behind after shear-induced detachment of HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Cytoskeletal stabilization increased attachment strength by eightfold, whereas cross-linking integrins to the substrate only caused a 1. 5 -fold increase. Reducing temperature—only during <b>shear</b> application—also increased <b>attachment</b> strength eightfold, with detachment again occurring between focal adhesion proteins and actin. Detachment at the focal adhesion-cytoskeleton interface was also observed in mouse and human fibroblasts and was ligand-independent, highlighting the ubiquity of this mode of detachment in the presence of divalent cations. These data show that the cytoskeleton and its dynamic coupling to focal adhesions are critically important for cell adhesion in niche with divalent cations...|$|R

Their three proximal tarsal pads (euplantulae) have a nubby surface, whereas the most distal euplantula is rather smooth with a hexagonal ground pattern resembling that described for the great green bush-cricket Tettigonia viridissima. This is, to our knowledge, the first report on nubby euplantulae in Orthoptera and the co-occurrence of nubby and smooth euplantulae on a single tarsus in a polyneopteran species. When adhering upside down to a horizontal glass plate, A. diadematus attaches its nubby euplantulae less often, compared to situations in which the animal is hanging upright or head down on a vertical plate. We discuss possible reasons for this kind of clinging behaviour, such as morphological constrains, the different role of normal and <b>shear</b> forces in <b>attachment</b> enhancement of the nubby and smooth pads, ease of the detachment process, and adaptations to walking on cylindrical substrates...|$|R

40|$|Left common carotid arteries of New Zealand white rabbits were ligated rostral {{to origin}} of the thyroid artery to reduce flow in the carotid {{upstream}} of this branch, and the vessels were examined 5 days later. Estimates of mean shear stress in the upstream carotid artery indicated a decrease of 73 % (from 12. 1 +/- 1. 6 dynes/cm 2 to 3. 26 +/- 0. 58 dynes/cm 2). The contralateral common carotid artery carried collateral flow and experienced a 170 % increase in shear stress (from 11. 3 +/- 1. 6 dynes/cm 2 to 30. 5 +/- 4. 6 dynes/cm 2). There was an adaptive reduction in the diameter in the left common carotid artery (low shear) from 2. 07 +/- 0. 06 mm to 1. 75 +/- 0. 12 mm, but {{the diameter of the}} right carotid was unchanged. Fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of endothelium exposed to low <b>shear</b> revealed <b>attachment</b> of leukocytes (5. 02 +/- 1. 59 cells/mm 2, mean +/- SE) that were identified as monocytes using the monoclonal antibody HAM 56. Laser confocal microscopy demonstrated that they were migrating across the endothelial cell monolayer. Fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of left common carotid artery (low shear) also revealed cell morphology suggestive of endothelial cell desquamation. Endothelial cell loss was confirmed by morphometric determination of cell number (1. 29 +/- 0. 13 x 10 (4) cells/mm length in experimental animals versus 1. 71 +/- 0. 08 x 10 (4) cells/mm length in sham-operated animals). This endothelial cell loss may be an adaptation to a narrowing of carotid arteries exposed to low shear, which reduces luminal surface area of the vessel. Staining of F-actin with rhodamine phalloidin showed that endothelial cells exposed to low shear were less elongated and had fewer stress fibers than normal cells. By contrast, increasing shear stress by two- to threefold caused {{an increase in the number}} of stress fibers and a reduction in peripheral actin staining. Distal carotid ligation provided a consistent and well-defined in vivo technique for manipulating shear stresses imposed on a large population of endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|One {{effective}} method {{of increasing the}} mechanical joint efficiency of highly loaded composite joints entails the reinforcement of the joining area with thin high-strength metal foils. These foils are locally embedded into the composite laminate by means of ply substitution techniques, thus avoiding any local laminate thickening and providing for a local hybrid laminate with high bearing and shear capabilities and high robustness. The feasibility and suitability of this advanced reinforcement technique has been extensively studied in view of its application on highly loaded bolted joints of cylindrical and conical spacecraft structures and monolithic and sandwich laminates aiming at structural weight savings, assembly work reductions, robustness increase and overall structural design optimizations. The future Ariane 5 composite Booster, a payload adaptor and an ATV distancing module are the main applications being considered within the study. The presented activities include numerical and experimental studies which {{are focused on the}} mechanical performance improvement in comparison to the reference conventional design. An extensive sample and component test program has been performed which analyzes and evaluates the impact of different design parameters and load conditions on the load bearing capabilities and hence the reinforcement efficiency. The single bolt bearing strength of the hybrid laminates {{on the one hand and}} the coupling efficiency of the transition zone, which is characterized by the gradual replacement of certain composite plies, on the other represent the two basic issues being focused on. Considerable bearing strength improvements of up to 2. 8 times the bearing strength capabilities of the reference pure CFRP have been reported. The bearing behavior of the bolt loaded holes of hybrid laminates as well as the delamination and strength behavior of the ply substitutions within the transition region have been studied and predicted by means of numerical simulations which consider the progressive damage response of the composite material and the elastoplastic behavior of the reinforcing metal. The correlation with the test results shows an excellent accuracy of the modeling strategy. The verification of the hybrid technique’s processability, inspectability and compatibility with standard industrial processes has been successfully demonstrated by the manufacturing of a payload adaptor by the fibre placement technique featuring continuous and discrete hybridized regions for the upper and lower root joint as well as for local tank and <b>shear</b> panel <b>attachments.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} flame configurations and heat release distributions exist in high swirl, annular flows, due {{to the existence of}} inner and outer shear layers as well a vortex breakdown bubble. Each of these different configurations, in turn, has different thermoacoustic sensitivities and influences on combustor emissions, nozzle durability, and liner heating. This paper presents findings on the sensitivities of the outer shear layer- stabilized flames to a range of parameters, including equivalence ratio, bulkhead temperature, flow velocity, and preheat temperature. There is significant hysteresis for flame attachment/detachment from the outer shear layer and this hysteresis is also described. Results are also correlated with extinction stretch rate calculations based on detailed kinetic simulations. In addition, we show that the bulkhead temperature near the flame attachment point has significant impact on outer shear layer detachment. This indicates that understanding the heat transfer between the edge flame stabilized in the shear layer and the nozzle hardware is needed in order to predict shear layer flame stabilization limits. Moreover, it shows that simulations cannot simply assume adiabatic boundary conditions if they are to capture these transitions. We also show that the reference temperature for correlating these transitions is quite different for attachment and local blow off. Finally, these results highlight the deficiencies in current understanding of the influence of fluid mechanic parameters (e. g. velocity, swirl number) on <b>shear</b> layer flame <b>attachment.</b> For example, they show that the seemingly simple matter of scaling flame transition points with changes in flow velocities is not understood...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} shear stress on the sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1 (SREBP 1) in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and the mechanotransduction mechanism involved. Application of a shear stress (12 dyn/cm 2) caused the proteolytic cleavage of SREBP 1 and the ensuing translocation of its transcription factor domain into the nucleus. As a result, shear stress increased the mRNAs encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), {{as well as the}} binding of 125 I-LDL. Using a step flow channel, we showed that SREBP 1 activation in ECs under laminar flow is transient, but disturbed flow causes sustained activation. In studying the shear stress–elicited molecular signaling that activates SREBP 1, we found that blocking the 1 -integrin with the AIIB 2 blocking-type monoclonal antibody inhibited SREBP 1 activation induced by <b>shear</b> stress. EC <b>attachment</b> to fibronectin or the activation of 1 -integrin in the suspended ECs by the TS 2 / 16 monoclonal antibody was sufficient for SREBP 1 activation. Furthermore, transient transfection assays showed that dominant-negative mutants of focal adhesion kinase and c-Src attenuated the shear stress–increased LDLR promoter activity. These results demonstrate that integrin signaling plays a critical role in the modulation of SREBP in ECs in response to shear stress. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2002; 22 : 76 - 81.)

40|$|Acid marination {{is known}} to improve meat tenderness. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to document the tenderness and color effects of marinating m. biceps femoris and to determine optimal acid levels. Acid solutions were prepared to 0. 1 M (low) and 0. 5 M (high) and pumped to 7 % of initial wt. in experiment 1; 0. 75 M (low) and 1. 5 M (high) and pumped to 10 % of initial wt. in experiment 2. Lactic acid, acetic acid and sodium citrate dihydrate (food grade citric acid) at low and high concentrations gave 6 treatments per experiment. Objective color measurements were taken at 0, 1, and 8 h after marination for experiments one and two. Cooking loss and tenderness were analyzed from steaks cut at 0, 1, and 8 h and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 d after injection and from steaks cut at 0, 1, and 8 h and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 d for experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Muscles were cut into steaks at 8 h and frozen at the times indicated after injection. Color was measured after given time to bloom at 0, 1 and 8 h post-injection for both experiments 1 and 2. Shear force measurements were obtained from an Instron with a Warner-Bratzler <b>shear</b> force <b>attachment.</b> No effects on tenderness (P = 0. 11) were observed from experiment 1. A significant (P = 0. 02) increase in tenderness was observed from 1 to 14 days during experiment 2. Sodium citrate dihydrate has little to no effect on tenderness; acetic and lactic acids at 0. 75 M to 1. 5 M had a positive effect on tenderness. In experiment 1, muscles marinated with 0. 5 M sodium citrate dihydrate decreased in lightness (L*), whereas samples with 0. 1 M lactic acid increased in L* at 1 h (P ≤ 0. 05). All muscles marinated with 0. 1 M sodium citrate, acetic and lactic acid increased significantly in lightness at 8 h (P ≤ 0. 05). Both redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) decreased for all six treatment groups from 0 to 8 h (P ≤ 0. 05) of experiment 1. There was a significant effect of treatment x time (P = 0. 04) on L* values. When using either acetic or lactic acids at higher concentrations, at the injection site, the color of the meat turned from red to a dark gray. Results of this work indicate that acid marination with 0. 1 to 0. 5 M of the three analyzed acids had no effect on tenderness, but at higher concentrations of acid (0. 75 to 1. 5 M) significantly (P = 0. 02) improved tenderness from 1 to 14 d.
