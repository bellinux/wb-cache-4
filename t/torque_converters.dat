50|$|The SKYACTIV-Drive is {{a family}} of {{automatic}} transmissions, named SKY-Drive.Mazda rejected dual-clutch technology in automatic transmissions, because the dual-clutch behavior in certain situations was sub-optimal. Instead, Mazda chose to re-design the conventional automatic transmission, making the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> take less duty while a multi-plate clutch disengages the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> most of the time. The new SkyActiv automatic transmission was designed to have six gears forward, one reverse gear, a short <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> and a clutch integrated with the <b>torque</b> <b>converter.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E

40|$|Lysholm-Smith <b>torques</b> <b>converters</b> has {{a special}} importance, {{due to the fact}} that this kind of machine can realize a {{continuously}} variation of the torque and of the rotational speed to the outlet shaft as function of the resistant torque and, in the same time, an amortization of the shocks and vibrations. This type of <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> has three turbine stages, intercalated by two stages of reactors (having stationary blades). The present paper presents theoretical and experimental results obtained on a Lysholm-Smith <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> CHC- 380 in the laboratory of Hydraulic Machinery Department from "POLITEHNICA" University of Timişoara, ROMÂNIA. Theoretical, was studied the behavior of the <b>torque</b> <b>converter,</b> expressed by the characteristic curves.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} math-based <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> modelling and simulation in both {{forward flow}} mode and reverse flow mode operations. Since, a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> {{plays an important}} role in transferring power from an engine shaft to the transmission shaft and vice versa and affects the fuel consumption and vehicle longitudinal dynamics, simulating the dynamic behaviour of this component in different operating modes is of great importance. Our <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> model is validated with the experimental results of the Honda CRV during the forward flow mode operation. The main focus of this research is on reverse flow mode simulation, and the application of the proposed math-based <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> model to evaluate damping characteristics of a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> due to undesired disturbances generated either from engine pulsations or from road bumps and potholes. The simulation results show that a <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> efficiently damps high frequency disturbances introduced from engine shaft to the transmission side and vice versa...|$|R

2500|$|The G20 {{featured}} {{either a}} 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 4-speed automatic. [...] Most {{front wheel drive}} transmissions from other SR-powered cars {{can be used with}} few modifications. The stock transmission as well as other SR20 transmissions are often upgraded with various modifications in order to handle more power. Common manual transmission modifications include cryo treating, shot peening, transmission case welding, aftermarket limited slip differential, aftermarket axles, and upgraded clutches. Common automatic transmission modifications include built valve bodies, aftermarket <b>torque</b> <b>converters,</b> automatic transmission fluid (ATF) coolers, additional ATF filters, and aftermarket TCUs. Higher rated transmission swaps from front-wheel drive VQ or QR25DE powered cars such as the 2002–2006 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec-V have also been performed.|$|E
2500|$|... 1982 saw {{the debut}} of the “Cross-Fire Injection” fuel {{delivery}} system. This TBI (Throttle Body Fuel Injection) was {{not the type of}} fuel injection installed previously in some C1 and C2 Corvettes. It utilized two throttle bodies combined with Chevrolet’s computer control system. The engine produced [...] and was mated to a new four-speed automatic transmission with <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> bypass in the top three gears. Compared to the previous Turbo-Hydramatic 3-speed, the new 700-R4 transmission had a lower first and second gear for improved low-end acceleration, and a fourth gear overdrive that would reduce engine RPM by 30 percent at highway cruising speeds, resulting in better fuel economy. On the downside, the new transmission was not considered a strong unit and proved problematic. The final model C3 Corvette's published performance numbers were 0-60 in 7.9seconds-the quarter-mile in 16.1 @ [...] This was the last year for 8-track tape availability and new “cross-fire injection” emblems appeared on front fenders. Nose and fuel door crossed-flags emblems changed to a more squared design.|$|E

30|$|But the Windrive {{also has}} {{existing}} weaknesses. Firstly, the hydraulic <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> absorbs the {{energy from the}} power grid to regulate the speed in lower wind speed period of time, which reduces the generating efficiency [16]. Secondly, the hydraulic <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> is generally required for the operating environment, so its applicability in the harsh natural environment of the wind farm remains to be verified [17]. Thirdly, variable speed constant frequency operating range of wind turbine with hydraulic <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> is restricted [18]. Fourthly, the manufacturing cost of the <b>torque</b> <b>converter</b> is high, {{which leads to the}} failure of mass production.|$|R
