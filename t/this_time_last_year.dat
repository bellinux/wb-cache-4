[...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work.

50|$|The {{assassination}} of Alexander Severus (222-235), {{the last of}} the Severans, brought to an end the Augustan Principate, and the empire descended into its third crisis, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>lasting</b> nearly fifty <b>years.</b> Twenty five emperors obtained power in the space of forty-nine years, with at least fifty one claiming it. Most were either murdered or died in military campaigns against rome's enemies that were now pressing hard on her frontiers.In addition to instability in governance and civil war the crisis years were marked by hyperinflation, plague and the first schism within the empire. The profound changes between the preceding Principate and succeeding Dominate, coincide with a shift from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity.

60|$|It was {{generally}} {{said at the}} clubs that Mr Alf had written this article himself. Old Splinter, {{who was one of}} a body of men possessing an excellent cellar of wine and calling themselves Paides Pallados, and who had written for the heavy quarterlies any <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>last</b> forty <b>years,</b> professed that he saw through the article. The 'Evening Pulpit' had been, he explained, desirous of going as far as it could in denouncing Mr Melmotte without incurring the danger of an action for libel. Mr Splinter thought that the thing was clever but mean. These new publications generally were mean. Mr Splinter was constant in that opinion; but, putting the meanness aside, he thought that the article was well done. According to his view it was intended to expose Mr Melmotte and the railway. But the Paides Pallados generally did not agree with him. Under such an interpretation, what had been the meaning of that paragraph in which the writer had declared that the work of joining one ocean to another was worthy of the nearest approach to divinity that had been granted to men? Old Splinter chuckled and gabbled as he heard this, and declared that there was not wit enough left now even among the Paides Pallados to understand a shaft of irony. There could be no doubt, however, at the time, that the world did not go with old Splinter, and that the article served to enhance the value of shares in the great railway enterprise.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In {{an effort}} to assist cattle {{producers}} in Oklahoma and Texas judge forage crop performance, a trial was held to determine forage yield of commercially available varieties and advanced experimental lines of annual ryegrass. The objective of this report is to summarize results from the 2008 trial. Materials and Methods The trial was conducted on a Wilson silt loam at the Noble Foundation Headquarters Farm near Ardmore, Okla. The trial consisted of 25 entries contributed from seven sources (Table 1). The entries were seeded in a clean-tilled seedbed on Sept. 17, 2007. Each entry was drilled in 5 - by 15 -foot plots, in 7 -inch rows, at 25 lb/acre (pure live seed basis) at a ½-inch planting depth with a HEGE 500 drill. Fertilization consisted of preplant incorporation of 23 lb P 205 /acre and 20 lb K 2 O/acre on Sept. 13, 2007. Plots were topdressed with 80 lb N/acre on Oct. 29, 2007, and Feb. 4, 2008. Plots were harvested with a HEGE sickle bar forage plot harvester at a 3 -inch height on Jan. 4, March 14, March 31, April 29 and June 3, 2008. The trial was a randomized complete block design with three replications. Data were analyzed with the general linear models procedure in SAS (Statistical Analysis Software, Cary, N. C.), and means were separated by the least significant difference (LSD) method (P ≤ 0. 05). Results and Discussion Precipitation was below the 30 -year average for Ardmore (Table 2). The deficit occurred primarily during the fall, limiting fall forage production. Good precipitation during the spring allowed for good spring forage production. Consequently, yields on average were 1000 lb/acre greater than average yield of entries in the 2007 trial. by J. A. Guretzky / jaguretzky@noble. org, and S. Norton / slnorton@noble. org Forage yield depended on the harvest date and entry (Table 3). Entries that stood out for producing the most forage during early spring, more than 4000 lb/acre by April 1, included Attain, Big Boss, Diamond T, Ed, Fantastic, Flying A, ME 4, ME 94, Surrey II, TXR 2006 -T 22 and WD- 40. Ed, ME 4, ME 94 and WD- 40 also produced good forage yields during <b>this</b> same <b>time</b> period <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> Entries that stood out for producing more forage during late spring (April 29 harvest) included AM- 4 T, Attain, Barextra, Big Boss, Florida 4 N, Hercules, ISI-LWD 4, Jumbo, Marshall, MO 1, Surrey II, Tam TBO, TXR 2006 -T 22 and Verdure (Table 3). When forage yield was examined over the whole season, differences among entries were mostly not significant. Forage yield among the top entries ranged from 6079 to 7420 lb/acre (Table 3). Any entry producing more than 6000 lb/acre across the season performed well...|$|R
