5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple {{studies have shown that}} thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain <b>their</b> <b>preferences.</b> They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of {{an automatic}} process.|$|E
5|$|For the 2008 season, the ACC possessed nine tie-in games. The Orange Bowl was the conference's BCS {{game and}} granted an {{automatic}} bid {{to the winner}} of the ACC Championship Game. The Chick-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta, Georgia had the first-pick of eligible ACC teams after the BCS game, followed by the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida and the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando, Florida. The Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee; the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina; and the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco, California submitted <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> together, and selected in that order if an agreement between them could not be reached. A special clause also guaranteed that, with a minimum of eight wins, the loser of the championship game would be selected no lower than by the Music City Bowl. The Humanitarian Bowl had the eighth-overall choice followed by the inaugural EagleBank Bowl in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Mayoral {{elections}} were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received {{a simple majority}} of votes in the general election, the two candidates who received the most votes competed in a second runoff election held several weeks later. In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled {{as a result of}} a citywide referendum. The new system, known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on <b>their</b> <b>preferences.</b> If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This eliminates the need to hold a separate runoff election and saves money. This was first implemented in the 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation. In 2007, the new system was implemented in the mayoral election for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Big data {{analysis}} technologies {{make it possible}} to perform controlled experiments to test hypotheses and analyze results to discover complex correlations.

25|$|The {{election}} was held using a preferential ballot. Members indicated <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> in {{order on the}} ballot.

25|$|Ballots {{assigned}} to eliminated candidates are recounted and {{assigned to}} one of the remaining candidates based on the next preference on each ballot. The process repeats until one candidate achieves a majority of votes cast for continuing candidates. Ballots that 'exhaust' all <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> (all its ranked candidates are eliminated) are set aside.|$|E

25|$|Students {{enter into}} the Canadian Resident Matching Service, {{commonly}} abbreviated as CaRMS {{in the fall of}} their final year. Students rank <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> of hospitals and specialties. A computerized matching system determines placement for residency positions.

25|$|This is {{different}} in another type of coordination game commonly called {{battle of the sexes}} (or conflicting interest coordination), as seen in Fig. 4. In this game both players prefer engaging in the same activity over going alone, but <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> differ over which activity they should engage in. Player 1 prefers that they both party while player 2 prefers that they both stay at home.|$|E
25|$|An individual's {{culture or}} {{ethnicity}} {{plays a role}} in their music cognition, including <b>their</b> <b>preferences,</b> emotional reaction, and musical memory. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features. Additionally, individuals' musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music.|$|E

25|$|GreenLeft {{voters have}} an {{eccentric}} position in <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for particular policies. Between 1989 and 2003 {{they were the}} most leftwing voters in the Netherlands, often a little more to the left than voters of the SP. These voters are in favor of the redistribution of wealth, free choice for euthanasia, opening the borders for asylum seekers, the multicultural society and are firmly against building new nuclear plants.|$|E
25|$|When {{allowing}} {{users to}} have ties in <b>their</b> <b>preferences,</b> {{the outcome of}} the Schulze method naturally depends on how these ties are interpreted in defining d. Two natural choices are that d represents either the number of voters who strictly prefer A to B (A>B), or the margin of (voters with A>B) minus (voters with B>A). But no matter how the ds are defined, the Schulze ranking has no cycles, and assuming the ds are unique it has no ties.|$|E
25|$|Neighborhood residents, voicing <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> {{through at}} least four {{community}} organizations, had differing perspectives on the evolving nature of the park, and what actions {{should or should not}} be taken. The Avenue A Block Association (made up of local businesses) insisted a curfew be introduced. Other groups such as Friends of Tompkins Square Park and political organizers on the poorer east side of the park preferred that no curfew be imposed, and Manhattan Community Board 3 took the middle ground.|$|E

25|$|The Family First Party, founded {{immediately}} before the 2002 state election, has a political ideology based on Christian-influenced conservatism. Although officially a secular party, it has close {{links to the}} Pentecostal movement, {{and in particular the}} Assemblies of God denomination. Its social policies generally mirror conservative Christian values (but not necessarily politically conservative values). The 2007 federal election saw 57.10% of <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> flow to the Liberals over the Labor Party in SA. The party's leader {{at the time of the}} election was Andrew Evans.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of F. scalaris, when full grown, are 6 to 8mm in length, {{white or}} cream colored, and {{slightly}} flattened dorsally. They have long tubercles on every segment with the {{projections of the}} eighth segment longer than both the seventh and eighth segments put together. The protuberances are feathered due to <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for semi-liquid organic matter. They {{are similar to the}} hairy maggot blowfly in appearance but smaller in size. During the pupal stage, the puparium is brown in color and the same shape as the larvae.|$|E
25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in <b>their</b> <b>preferences,</b> it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|E

30|$|Our {{model in}} total {{explains}} 31 % {{of the variance}} in followers’ preference for authoritarian leadership, 10 % variance in <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> for benevolent and moral leadership, and 9 % in <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> for transformational leadership. The proportion of variances explained by power distance orientation and CSE ranges from 5 % to 26 %, representing a medium to large effect size (Cohen 1988). Thus we conclude that it is worthwhile to investigate the role of power distance orientation and CSE in leadership preference.|$|R
