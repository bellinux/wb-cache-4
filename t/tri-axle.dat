25|$|The BR112 was {{launched}} in 1978 as a forerunner to the 2-series, replacing the BR111. The rest of the 2-series were launched in 1981 with the F82/F112 replacing the BF86/BF111 and the S82/S112 replacing the B86/B111, and then in 1982 the K82/K112 replacing the BR86/BR116. The BR112 was then updated to the N112 in 1984, and a <b>tri-axle</b> version of the K112 became available, known as the K112T. In 1985, the K82 and F82 were replaced by the 8.5-litre engined K92 and F92. Front-engined versions were in general discontinued on the European markets in the mid-1980s, but production continued in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In August 2008, the London Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy {{announced}} that {{the withdrawal of the}} bendy buses would take place, starting in 2009. So as to reduce additional costs to TfL, the buses would be withdrawn as their 5-year operating contracts came up for renewal, with the replacement types being decided by operators. Options for replacement would not preclude such measures as <b>tri-axle</b> buses. However, research has indicated that removing articulated vehicles may not be without cost; London Travel Watch undertook a study in September 2008 which found that to replace articulated vehicles on three bus routes, and maintain overall route capacity, would cost an additional £12.6m per annum, due to the additional vehicles necessitated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tri-axle</b> {{double-decker}} buses {{are common in}} high capacity operating environments where articulated buses are not used, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. <b>Tri-axle</b> buses also see high volume use in Dublin, Ireland. Imported <b>tri-axle</b> buses were used initially by Megabus for high capacity low cost intercity travel in the UK.|$|E

50|$|Subsequently, the Super Olympian was {{replaced}} by a <b>tri-axle</b> variant of the Volvo B9TL. Wrightbus offered similar <b>tri-axle</b> bodywork, which was unnamed and had slightly different rear styling, to the chassis. After the introduction of Euro IV-engined Volvo B9TL, this bodywork became known as the Eclipse Gemini <b>tri-axle,</b> but no bodywork carrying this name were known to have been built.|$|E
50|$|The K94EB, K114EB and K124EB {{were the}} only 4-series chassis with {{independent}} front suspension, being the primary choice for premium coaches. They were available as two-axle (4x2), <b>tri-axle</b> (6x2) and <b>tri-axle</b> with steered tag axle (6x2*4). A normal <b>tri-axle</b> coach would have the full designation of K124EB6x2NI, {{but because of the}} independent front suspension it was also available as K124EB6x2LI with low front, which made it possible to have a gangway between the front wheel arches and a low driving position, making it suitable for use in double-decker coaches.|$|E

50|$|The K94IB, K114IB and K124IB {{were the}} {{standard}} coach and intercity bus chassis with a rigid front axle. Like the K EB type, they were available as two-axle (4x2), <b>tri-axle</b> (6x2) and <b>tri-axle</b> with steered tag axle (6x2*4), {{and on the}} Latin American market also as quad-axle (8x2). The K94IB was quite rare, {{as it was in}} may ways in direct competition with the L94IB as an intercity bus.|$|E
5000|$|MAN Lion's Chassis is {{a series}} of modular chassis made to replace most of MAN's rear-engined low-entry, {{intercity}} and coach chassis. It was first introduced at the IAA Commercial Vehicles 2008 in Hanover. MAN prospected both two- and <b>tri-axle</b> low-entry, two-axle intercity and two- and <b>tri-axle</b> coach versions. The first of the intercity version appeared in 2008, the two-axle low-entry version in 2009 and both coach versions in 2010. The <b>tri-axle</b> low-entry version may have been abandoned. The models that the Lion's Chassis was set to replace weren't discontinued until the end of 2013. All chassis versions can be delivered as either a rolling chassis with shortened wheelbase for transport or as CIB ("Chassis in the box" [...] — partly assembled kit).|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the brucks were {{introduced}} in 1951, when Kenworth built a <b>tri-axle</b> one for Northern Pacific Railroad, which had a front part for 17 passengers and a taller, 18 ft long cargo compartment and a 136 hp Hall-Scott engine. Brucks were also available from Crown Coach, both as a 40 ft <b>tri-axle</b> carrying 20 passengers and with a 20 ft cargo compartment, or as a shorter 35 ft two-axle with 12 seats.|$|E

50|$|As a {{successor}} to the Carrus Vega, which was also built and sold as Volvo B10-400 and Volvo 7250 in Germany and Poland, the main difference {{was that it was}} built on the Volvo TX platform. The exterior was just as a simple facelift from the old model. The medium floor 8700 was available on B7R, B12B and B12M chassis, with all except the B7R available as a <b>tri-axle</b> bus. The 8700LE was available on B7RLE and B12BLE, with only the B12BLE as a <b>tri-axle</b> bus.|$|E
50|$|The tank chassis {{has evolved}} {{over the past years}} to {{accommodate}} greater payload weights. The tank chassis comes in tandem axle, spread axle, <b>tri-axle,</b> and hi/lo combo configurations. Tandem Axle Chassis were the industry standard initially. The closed tandem drop deck chassis typically have a GVWR of 65000 lb. The quest to increase payload capacities spawned the <b>tri-axle</b> chassis with the ability to scale 42000 lb. on the trailer axles. The addition of the third axle however added a significant increase to the tare weight of the chassis, thus limiting the permissible weight limits to comply with bridge laws. This led to the invention of the Spread Axle Chassis with a spread of 109 in allowing for the same weight to be dispersed on the rear axles of the trailer (42000 lb) as the <b>tri-axle.</b> This is the new industry standard with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 80000 lb.|$|E

50|$|The Volvo 8500 was an {{aluminium}} body single-deck city/intercity bus {{manufactured by}} Volvo between 2001 and 2011. It was available with medium floor as two-axle (B7R, B12M), <b>tri-axle</b> (B12M) and the articulated 8500A (B12MA). As the low-entry Volvo 8700LE as two-axle (B7RLE, B12BLE), <b>tri-axle</b> (B12BLE) and the articulate 8500LEA (B9SALE). From 2005 {{it was also}} available as the fully low floor Volvo 7500 (B9LA, B9SALF), which even came in a bi-articulated version. In the early years, the 8500LE was available with CNG on the B10BLE chassis. Later, CNG was only available on the 7500.|$|E
50|$|Volvo Buses India Pvt Ltd in Hosakote, {{near the}} city of Bengaluru, started {{production}} of the Volvo B7R bi-axle coaches since 2000. At present, they offer the Volvo 9400 range. In addition to the standard 12 m 9400 (B7R or B9R chassis), they offer since 2012 also the 13.7 m <b>tri-axle</b> 9400XL (B9R 6x2 chassis) and the luxurious 14,5 m <b>tri-axle</b> 9400PX (B11R 6x2 chassis).The 9400PX is provided with a steerable tag axle to help it handle tight corners.The latter being the first on the new light-weight Volvo PX platform.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Scania started {{testing the}} Citywide LE as a {{diesel-electric}} hybrid-powered bus, and in 2014 both the 12.0-metre two-axle and the 14.8-metre <b>tri-axle</b> {{were introduced in}} diesel-electric hybrid-powered versions.|$|E
50|$|The B12BLE {{was also}} {{available}} in the articulated form since 2005, which {{is known as the}} B12BLEA chassis. The B12BLE can be available in the rigid, <b>tri-axle</b> and articulated form.|$|E

50|$|As the B12B/B12BLE chassis {{also would}} be gone by 2012, and the B8R/B8RLE was still not ready, Volvo {{had to come up}} with a {{solution}} for the <b>tri-axle</b> versions. Because at that time B12B/B12BLE was the only <b>tri-axle</b> chassis offered for city and intercity buses. So with the introduction of 8900/8900LE, Volvo now offered B7RLE 6x2, B9RLE 6x2 and B9R 6x2. It was also offered on standard two-axle B7RLE, B7R and B9R. In the summer of 2013 the first B8R and B8RLE started to appear in low numbers, and from 2014 with Euro VI requirements, no 7s or 9s are offered anymore.|$|E
50|$|The Volvo B9RLE was a 9.4-litre engined <b>tri-axle</b> low-entry single-decker bus and {{double-decker}} bus chassis manufactured by Volvo between 2010 and 2013. The double-decker {{can be built}} as either closed top or open top. It was introduced as an interim replacement for the soon to be discontinued B12BLE in the short gap of years before they had the Euro VI compliant B8RLE ready. At {{the same time they}} introduced a <b>tri-axle</b> variant of the B7RLE, but in Volvo's home markets the 290 bhp that the D7E produces is considered way too little for a 15-metre bus.|$|E
50|$|In April 2014, Scania in Norway {{received}} {{an even bigger}} order, including the first batch of 3.20 LE to Norway. Out of a total order of 89 buses, 36 were OmniExpress. 15 13.0-metre 3.20 LE, four 11.0-metre 3.20, five 12.5-metre 3.40 and twelve 14.9-metre <b>tri-axle</b> 3.40 were delivered to companies Setesdal Bilruter and Agder Buss for newyear 2015, for their new PSO contracts in Aust-Agder. In June 2015, Nobina Norge received 36 CNG-powered 3.20 LE (18 two-axle 13.0-metre and 18 <b>tri-axle</b> 14.8-metre) for local routes in Ski, being the first ever delivery of CNG-powered Scania buses in Norway.|$|E
