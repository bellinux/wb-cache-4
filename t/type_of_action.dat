5|$|Fighting {{games are}} a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, {{even as the}} genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E
5|$|Shoot 'em ups are a subgenre of shooter game, in turn a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> game. These {{games are}} usually viewed from a {{top-down}} or side-view perspective, and players must use ranged weapons {{to take action}} at a distance. The player's avatar is typically a vehicle under constant attack. Thus, the player's goal is to shoot {{as quickly as possible}} at anything that moves or threatens him. In some games, the player's character can withstand some damage; in others, a single hit will result in his destruction. The main skills required in shoot 'em ups are fast reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns. Some games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and the player has to memorise their patterns to survive. These games belong to one of the fastest-paced video game genres.|$|E

25|$|The {{owner of}} a {{trademark}} may pursue legal action against trademark infringement. Most countries require formal registration of a trademark as a precondition for pursuing this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The United States, Canada and other countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means action {{can be taken to}} protect an unregistered trademark if it is in use. Still, common law trademarks offer the holder in general less legal protection than registered trademarks.|$|E
25|$|Hunting RPGs are a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> RPG subgenre {{featuring}} the player and an optional team {{of up to}} three other players hunting down larger monsters with a set amount of time, using weapons crafted from the materials extracted from the map and/or from the monsters themselves. Unlike most RPG genres, the monsters have no health bars or hit points, but have stronger attack and defense stats, forcing the players to use survival items and coordinated strategies to eliminate a specific monster. First appeared in Capcom's Monster Hunter franchise, these games later expanded the hunting RPG genre into other games as well, such as Bandai Namco Entertainment's God Eater franchise.|$|E

25|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{was typical}} all along D Company's assault line {{and every time}} the Australians {{received}} fire from a building, tank rounds were used to breach the walls and a small team of infantry would conduct room clearance until all resistance was quelled. During the fighting some of the VC had discarded their uniforms and weapons and attempted to mingle with the pockets of civilians that were unable to escape. The continued presence of civilians in the village required the Australians to expose themselves to extreme danger while trying to usher these groups {{to the rear of}} the battle zone. Others tried to flee the village, or hide in the small air raid bunkers attached to every house. The fighting continued all afternoon and only ended at last light. With Binh Ba still insecure, D Company and their armoured support subsequently occupied a defensive harbour for the night, exhausted by the fighting. Overnight B Company killed two VC trying to break out to the south.|$|E
500|$|A beat 'em up (sometimes {{also called}} [...] "brawlers") is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> game where the player {{character}} must fight {{a large number}} of enemies in unarmed combat or with melee weapons. Gameplay consists of walking through a level, one section at a time, defeating a group of enemies before advancing to the next section; a boss fight normally occurs {{at the end of each}} level. However arcade versions of these games are often quite difficult to win, causing players to spend more money to try to win.|$|E

In striking contrast to the situation in , the Catawba Act represents an explicit redefinition of the relationship between the Federal Government and the Catawbas; an intentional termination of the special federal {{protection for}} the Tribe and its members; and a plain statement that state law applies to the Catawbas as to all “other persons or citizens.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Cinematographer Daniel Mindel {{stated that}} The Force Awakens would use real {{locations}} and scale models over computer-generated imagery {{to make it}} aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy.

I think {{that more and more}} people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick." [...] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.|$|E
2500|$|The SR9 is {{the first}} large-caliber striker fired pistol {{designed}} and manufactured by Sturm Ruger.
