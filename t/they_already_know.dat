5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E

25|$|Further explanation: Speakers who {{use this}} {{intonation}} pattern {{do not do}} so categorically, but instead also end many questions with a rising pitch. Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer. So, a speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what they think <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know,</b> that yes, the person they're talking to is painting his/her garage.|$|E

60|$|Tess {{had gone}} back earlier. How {{to break the news}} was more than she could think.

25|$|Often {{described}} as the opposite of déjà vu, jamais vu involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing {{that he or she}} has been in the situation before. Jamais vu is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> Jamais vu is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|As Part Two begins, it {{is assumed}} that the literate classes of Spain have all read {{the first part of the}} story. Cervantes's meta-fictional device was to make even the {{characters}} in the story familiar with the publication of Part One, as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of Part One) that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
5000|$|An enquiry {{was held}} into the {{incident}} and Sir John Hoddinott, the Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary later found [...] "suggestive evidence of collusion between {{some or all}} of the chief officers of the Sussex force to conceal what <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew,</b> and that an arguable case of attempting to pervert the course of justice might be made out." ...|$|R
50|$|Therefore, the {{minerals}} were not collected {{because people were}} looking for copper but for virtues like those mentioned or simply because of its brightness and colour, but this knowledge of {{the minerals}} is critical since <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> how to recognize them and where to collect them when, later, they started the systematic search for ores.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>knew</b> so much, it was {{a painful}} and feverish half hour {{to those in the}} launch, the time that intervened between this {{dialogue}} and the moment when the boat of the Dane came alongside of their own.

500|$|Pam and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are invited}} to Pam's former fiancé Roy Anderson's (David Denman) wedding, which takes place at 8am before work. They are both {{surprised}} by Roy's beautiful home and the elegant wedding details, and Roy tells them he runs a very successful gravel company. During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E
2500|$|Many empiricists are {{now also}} trying to apply modern {{learning}} models and techniques {{to the question of}} language acquisition, with marked success. [...] Similarity-based generalization marks another avenue of recent research, which suggests that children may be able to rapidly learn how to use new words by generalizing about the usage of similar words that <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> (see also the distributional hypothesis).|$|E

[...] Thanks to information from Azeck, they track Talec down to an industrial complex but are waylaid by the White Boys who believe Caine to be behind the deaths of their soldiers.

5000|$|Gimpel was {{characterized}} {{in the same}} report as [...] "a very difficult subject for interrogation. He was a professional German espionage agent, thoroughly indoctrinated in security.

2500|$|In 1874 Carl Wernicke {{proposed}} [...] {{that the}} ability to imitate speech {{plays a key role in}} language acquisition. This is now a widely researched issue in child development. [...] A study of 17,000 one and two word utterances made by six children between 18 months to 25 months found that, depending upon the particular infant, between 5% and 45% of their words might be mimicked. These figures are minima since they concern only immediately heard words. Many words that may seem spontaneous are in fact delayed imitations heard days or weeks previously. At 13 months children who imitate new words (but not ones <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know)</b> show a greater increase in noun vocabulary at four months and non noun vocabulary at eight months. A major predictor of vocabulary increase in both 20 months, 24 months, and older children [...] between 4 and 8 years is their skill in repeating nonword phone sequences (a measure of mimicry and storage). [...] This is also the case with children with Down's syndrome [...] The effect is larger than even age: in a study of 222 two-year-old children that had spoken vocabularies ranging between 3–601 words the ability to repeat nonwords accounted for 24% of the variance compared to 15% for age and 6% for gender (girls better than boys).|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} it would be proper now to {{communicate}} this, formally or informally, {{to the people of the}} Southern States.

Nor do I think it proper now to suspend military operations to try any experiment of negotiation.|$|E
60|$|Among {{those who}} took the most lively {{interest}} in endeavouring to discover the person by whom young Charles Hazlewood had been waylaid and wounded was Gilbert Glossin, Esquire, late writer in ----, now Laird of Ellangowan, {{and one of the}} worshipful commission of justices of the peace for the county of ----. His motives for exertion on this occasion were manifold; but we presume that our readers, from what <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> of this gentleman, will acquit him of being actuated by any zealous or intemperate love of abstract justice.|$|E
