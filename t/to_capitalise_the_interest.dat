5000|$|In August 2009 and in {{addition}} to the reunion tour commitments, Kajagoogoo again took to the stage to headline the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' all day music event in Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. This was followed in September by a new compilation CD/DVD, released by the band's original label EMI Records, called Too Shy - The Best of Kajagoogoo & Limahl. It featured two newly recorded tracks, plus a brand new promotional video for [...] "Space Cadet", one of the new recordings.

5000|$|The {{opening night}} was on 7 April 1928 and was {{promoted}} by the Birmingham Greyhound Club Limited. The stadium had been built {{to the cost of}} £70,000. Despite the fact that the sport was experiencing a boom for some reason the promoters ran into financial difficulties and within two years were left bankrupt. The Birmingham Greyhound Club Limited had failed <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on <b>the</b> growing <b>interest</b> observed all around the country. A licence to continue racing was refused in November 1928 due to evidence of funds owed and the official receiver announced that £95,000 was owed to creditors during a meeting in August 1929 (an extraordinary amount {{based on the fact that}} the stadium had only cost £75,000 to build).|$|R
5000|$|... "Wheels Ain't Coming Down" [...] was {{released}} as the opening track on Return to Base, {{which was a}} commercial failure in 1979; a period when the band's popularity was low. The song also appeared on the 1980 extended play Six of the Best, which also failed to chart. In 1980, the band's fortunes were revived after a successful performance at <b>the</b> Reading Festival. <b>To</b> <b>capitalise</b> on <b>the</b> new <b>interest</b> in <b>the</b> band, the album We'll Bring the House Down {{was released}} in March 1981, which featured a number of tracks re-used from Return to Base, including [...] "Wheels Ain't Coming Down". Following up the Top Ten hit [...] "We'll Bring the House Down", the band decided to release [...] "Wheels Ain't Coming Down" [...] as a single in March 1981. It reached No. 60, lasting three weeks on the chart.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{suffering}} from low popularity {{and a lack}} of chart action in the UK since 1976, Slade continued to record and tour, performing in smaller venues such as clubs and universities. However, their fortunes changed when they were offered a headlining slot at the Reading festival in August 1980, following a late cancellation by Ozzy Osbourne. The band's performance in front of the 65,000-strong crowd saw Slade back in the public eye. The music press began to take an <b>interest</b> in <b>the</b> band again, while heavy metal followers also began deeming the band 'cool'. The band quickly released the extended play Alive at Reading, giving the band their first chart action since 1977, while the compilation Slade Smashes! was a big success. <b>To</b> <b>capitalise</b> on <b>the</b> new <b>interest</b> in <b>the</b> band, the band recorded and released [...] "We'll Bring the House Down" [...] as their new single in January 1981. A successful comeback single, it reached No. 10 in the UK, with the album of the same name following in March. The song also peaked at No. 4 in the Melody Maker Chart.|$|R
500|$|The All England Croquet Club {{was founded}} on 23 July 1868 by six gentlemen at the offices of The Field, a weekly country and sports magazine. After a yearlong search a {{suitable}} ground of four acres of meadowland was located between the London and South Western Railway and Worple Road in Wimbledon, then an outer suburb of London. The club's committee decided on 24 September 1869 to lease the ground and paid £50 rental for the first year, a fee which increased to £75 and £100, respectively, over the following two years. The increasing rent, coupled with a waning <b>interest</b> in <b>the</b> sedate sport of croquet, was causing the club financial difficulties. In February 1875 it decided to introduce lawn tennis at its grounds <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on <b>the</b> growing <b>interest</b> in this new sport and generate additional revenue. The proposal was made by Henry Jones, a sports writer who published extensively in The Field under his nom de plume [...] "Cavendish" [...] and who had joined the club in 1869. The introduction of lawn tennis was approved {{at the annual meeting}} and the club's membership fee was set at two guineas to cover both sports. At a cost of £25, one croquet lawn was converted to a tennis court; soon after its completion on 25 February 1875, a dozen new club members joined. In 1876 four more lawns, a third of the ground, were handed over to lawn tennis to address the increase in new members. A committee member, George Nicol, was appointed to deal exclusively with lawn tennis affairs. Lawn tennis had become so popular that on 14 April 1877 the name of the club was formally changed, at the suggestion of founding member John H. Hale, to the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club (AEC).|$|R
