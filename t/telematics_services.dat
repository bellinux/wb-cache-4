50|$|Since September 2007, the Russian government's Resolution No 575 {{introduces}} new regulation {{rules of}} <b>telematics</b> <b>services.</b> Network operators (ISPs) can now legally limit individual {{actions of the}} subscriber's network activity, if such actions threaten the normal functioning of the network. ISPs are obliged to exclude the possibility of access to information systems, network addresses, or uniform pointers which a subscriber informs the operator of communication in the form specified in the contract. The subscriber is obliged to take actions to protect the subscriber terminal from the impact of malicious software and {{to prevent the spread}} of spam and malicious software to its subscriber terminal. In reality, most Russian ISPs shape the traffic of P2P protocols (like BitTorrent) with lower priority (P2P is about of 80% of traffic there). Also, there is popular method, called retracker, for redirecting some BitTorrent traffic to the ISP's cache servers and other subscribers inside of a metropolitan area network (MAN). Access to MANs is usually with greater speed (2x-1000x or more, specified in the contract) and better quality than the rest of the Internet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{takes care}} of an {{evolution}} of web architecture for <b>Telematics</b> <b>services</b> on ubiquitous environments. Telematics {{has become one of}} upcoming convergence fields where many kinds of services are now be operated or planned to be launched. However, most of <b>Telematics</b> <b>services</b> are currently operated in a closed architecture: they require hardware and software configurations exclusively. In order to achieve ubiquitous capabilities in Telematics model, this paper proposes a web service platform for Telematics based on web service architecture. With the proposed Telematics service broker, service providers can register their services, and service consumers can find what services are available and how to use them. Adopting open architecture, the platform will contribute to efficient provision of <b>Telematics</b> <b>services</b> in upcoming ubiquitous environments.
