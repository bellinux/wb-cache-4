5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E

25|$|Box enters, {{after a brief}} offstage altercation with Cox on the staircase. After dismissing Bouncer, he <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bread roll, {{lights the}} fire, and puts a rasher of bacon on the gridiron.

25|$|Then {{the priest}} {{takes up the}} prosphoron for the Living. He <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> larger {{particle}} in commemoration of the Patriarch (or Synod of Bishops), and a second larger particle in commemoration of the Ruler (in former times, {{this would have been}} the Emperor, but nowadays it reflects the government of the local nation in which the church is located). He then takes out smaller particles in commemoration of others among the living. He must always commemorate the Bishop who ordained him (if he is still among the living), the clergy who are concelebrating with him, and any living Orthodox Christian whom he wishes. Churches and monasteries often have diptychs (memorial books) of the living and departed who should be commemorated at every Liturgy.|$|E

Due to the situation, Sam uses the {{pseudonym}} Luke Skywalker instead of revealing his real last name to her. Her BBC counterpart is Ruth Tyler (Joanne Froggatt in 1973 & Judi Jones in 2006). Changing her name in the American version brought the name full-circle; Sam Tyler's surname was selected by writer Matthew Graham's daughter in homage to Doctor Who companion Rose Tyler. In the last episode, Sam finally reveals his real name to his mother, who smiles, having suspected all along that he was her son in an older incarnation.|$|E

He boasts that the only shortcoming of such a mortar was that the betel tasted somewhat sour. The second man then takes out his silver mortar and says that, with silver, the betel would only taste sour if left for too long. The third man, the poorest of them all, takes out his wooden mortar and says that, having tried golden and silver mortars, he has concluded that betel crushed under wood tastes the best of all.

Later that day, Peter and Simpson are met with an angry mob instead led by Mayor Adam West, intent on driving the latter out of town. Desperate for a place to live without being bothered by furious citizens, Simpson makes a heartfelt speech, professing that he is just as imperfect as everyone else, causing the residents of Quahog to apologize and embrace with him. A split second later, however, the tables turn to a surprise ending as Simpson <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> knife and kills three people before running off.

Steve <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> large pocket knife and makes a cut {{on the back of}} her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.|$|E
500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} and <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Jenny Craig Anytime Bar {{from his}} shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing {{that he had}} been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would ever have a gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E

Talking to a witness about the victim, a shopkeeper who had been bludgeoned to {{the head with a}} snow globe, he sees a poster of The Dark Defender, a vigilante killer based on the Bay Harbor Butcher. Later, at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Dexter falls asleep and dreams about the death of his mother, Laura Moser (Katherine Kirkpatrick). In the dream, he enters the cargo container where she was killed, dressed in The Dark Defender's cloak, and beats his mother's murderers to the ground, saving her. When he tells his sponsor Lila about his dream, she tells him that he must confront them to seek closure. He and Lila travel to Naples, Florida where one of the three men, Santos Jimenez, is alive and running a tavern. Having been warned by his girlfriend Rita Bennett's mother Gail (JoBeth Williams) to leave Rita (Julie Benz) and her children alone, Dexter tells Rita that he is going away while Gail is visiting. Leaving Lila in their motel room, he goes to Jimenez's bar and waits until all of the patrons have left. Dexter tries to explain to Jimenez how he feels, but Jimenez <b>takes</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> baseball bat and threatens to beat him. In response, Dexter disarms and brutally beats him, revealing his past to Jimenez as one of the boys he left in his mother's blood. Jimenez tells Dexter that his mother was killed because she was not only a narcotics informant to Harry Morgan (James Remar)—Dexter's adoptive father and a police officer—but also his lover. Dexter punches Jimenez and is close to killing him when Lila phones and he tells her that he is about to [...] "use". Thinking that he is about to use drugs, she urges him not to go any further, because [...] "using" [...] will only leave him empty and alone inside. He returns to the motel, leaving Jimenez unconscious in the bar, and falls asleep in Lila's lap, distraught and completely drained.|$|E
