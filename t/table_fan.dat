40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} a growing concern {{recently}} about energy use and its adverse impact on the environment. Industrial motor uses a major fraction of total industrial energy uses. Conventional ceiling and table fans {{have the potential to}} improve on energy efficiency, but the enhancements described in this research study increase the device’s efficiency further, thereby permitting greater energy saving gains. The <b>Table</b> <b>Fan</b> Motor which is currently used has poor efficiency due to the losses, type of material used for the stator and rotor parts and also due to the construction design and winding design. A novel approach which can enhance the energy saving concept in the <b>table</b> <b>fan</b> together in conjunction with the environmental “Go Green ” concept is well discussed in this research. The main objective is not only to reduce the power losses in occurs, there by increasing the overall efficiency and the speed of the fan thus increasing the energy saving as well but also to determine the best type of material to be used for the construction of the stator and rotor parts of the motor. MATLAB software is used for the evaluation and the performance of the induction motor efficiency.

40|$|Abstract This master’s {{thesis is}} a project of 20 p made in {{accordance}} with the requirements set by Halmstad University for a Master’s degree in Technical Product and Productions development. The objectives were to make a conceptual redesign of a portable fan for the American company Hunter Fan. The redesign is intended to be suitable on the Scandinavian market. The methodology and process are mainly based on Ullman’s methodology for product development, in combination with Landqvist’s and Östelin’s design methodology for production development. An optimal design process is rarely identical from project to project; the best parts and tools from the different design methodologies were used as support during the process. The design process in this project started with research within topics suitable to solve the problem definition. Brand research were made to determine Hunter Fan core values and target group, the existing product was analysed to see what could be improved and the market was investigated to learn from competitors. An image board was made to express the values wanted for this project and for communication with people directly involved in the design process. Trends were observed by a visit to the Stockholm Furniture Fair. Further user personas and surveys were made to investigate the Scandinavian consumer’s needs and requirements. This method gave important knowledge of how to design a portable fan suitable for the Scandinavian market. Experts on the subject of matter were interviewed to get understanding of how fan blade works and what alternative safety solutions there are. In the ideation phase, brainstorming and sketching was a big part. Over a hundred idea sketches were made and the ideas were carefully evaluated against collected fact. In the finalization phase, the remaining concepts were refined with methods like mock-up models, CAD and computer renderings. The result is a successful conceptual design of a <b>table</b> <b>fan</b> suitable for the Scandinavian market. Hunter Fan also believes the fan can easily be transformed to the Urban American cities of New York and other large cities. The <b>table</b> <b>fan</b> owns the values of Scandinavian design; a simple uncomplicated design, functional and with an expression of simplicity and modernity. It still owns Hunter Fan core value of high quality. The design easily blends in the carefully decorated Scandinavian home. It is also easy to move, put away and store like the Scandinavian consumer requires. There is a need on the Scandinavian market for a well designed portable fan and the final design of this project fulfill the requirements to be a successful product...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the hover}} {{capability}} of rotary wing Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), {{it is of}} interest to improve their aerodynamic performance, and hence hover endurance (or payload capability). In this research, a shrouded rotor conguration is studied and implemented, {{that has the potential}} to oer two key operational benets: enhanced system thrust for a given input power, and improved structural rigidity and crashworthiness of an MAV platform. The main challenges involved in realising such a system for a lightweight craft are: design of a lightweight and stiff shroud, and increased sensitivity to external flow disturbances that can affect flight stability. These key aspects are addressed and studied in order to assess the capability of the shrouded rotor as a platform of choice for MAV applications. A fully functional shrouded rotor vehicle (disk loading 60 N/m 2) was designed and constructed with key shroud design variables derived from previous studies on micro shrouded rotors. The vehicle weighed about 280 g (244 mm rotor diameter). The shrouded rotor had a 30 % increase in power loading in hover compared to an unshrouded rotor. Due to the stiff, lightweight shroud construction, a net payload benefit of 20 - 30 g was achieved. The different components such as the rotor, stabilizer bar, yaw control vanes and the shroud were systematically studied for system efficiency and overall aerodynamic improvements. Analysis of the data showed that the chosen shroud dimensions was close to optimum for a design payload of 250 g. Risk reduction prototypes were built to sequentially arrive at the nal conguration. In order to prevent periodic oscillations in flight, a hingeless rotor was incorporated in the shroud. The vehicle was successfully flight tested in hover with a proportional-integral-derivative feedback controller. A flybarless rotor was incorporated for efficiency and control moment improvements. Time domain system identification of the attitude dynamics of the flybar and flybarless rotor vehicle was conducted about hover. Controllability metrics were extracted based on controllability gramian treatment for the flybar and flybarless rotor. In edgewise gusts, the shrouded rotor generated up to 3 times greater pitching moment and 80 % greater drag than an equivalent unshrouded rotor. In order to improve gust tolerance and control moments, rotor design optimizations were made by varying solidity, collective, operating RPM and planform. A rectangular planform rotor at a collective of 18 deg was seen to offer the highest control moments. The shrouded rotor produced 100 % higher control moments due to pressure asymmetry arising from cyclic control of the rotor. It was seen that the control margin of the shrouded rotor increased as the disk loading increased, which is however deleterious in terms of hover performance. This is an important trade-off that needs to be considered. The flight performance of the vehicle in terms of edgewise gust disturbance rejection was tested in a series of bench top and free flight tests. A standard <b>table</b> <b>fan</b> and an open jet wind tunnel setup was used for bench top setup. The shrouded rotor had an edgewise gust tolerance of about 3 m/s while the unshrouded rotor could tolerate edgewise gusts greater than 5 m/s. Free flight tests on the vehicle, using VICON for position feedback control, indicated the capability of the vehicle to recover from gust impulse inputs from a pedestal fan at low gust values (up to 3 m/s) ...|$|E

Appearance, power input and price are the main parameters considered today when purchasing cooling fans, while their cooling capacity and efficiency of energy use are unknown.

Studies conducted in the form combine qualitative and quantitative aspects and involve observation, interviews, and questionnaires, with teachers and school administrators as respondents. The findings showed that 37. 7 percent of the respondents are not sure about the classroom space needed by each special education student. Approximately 30 percent of the respondents also are uncertain, given the financial allocation for special education integration program. In addition, the majority of respondents (53. 6 %) are satisfied with the location of the special education program at their school, located {{on the ground floor of}} each building. Approximately 55. 8 percent of the respondents agreed that the special education classroom in their schools have adequate lighting, and 52 percent agreed that there is good air circulation.
