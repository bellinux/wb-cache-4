40|$|We use the {{introduction}} {{and the subsequent}} removal of the flash order facility (an actionable indication of interest, IOI) from the NASDAQ as a natural experiment to investigate the impact of voluntary disclosure of <b>trading</b> <b>intent</b> on market quality. We find that flash orders significantly improve liquidity in the NASDAQ. In addition, overall market quality improves substantially when the flash functionality is introduced and deteriorates when it is removed. One explanation for our findings is that flash orders are placed by less informed traders and fulfill their role as an advertisement of uninformed liquidity needs. They successfully attract responses from liquidity providers immediately after the announcement is placed, thus lowering the risk-bearing cost for the overall market. Our study is important in understanding the impact of voluntary disclosure, in guiding future market design choices, and in the current debate on dark pools and IOIs...|$|E

30|$|The {{architectural}} information {{coupled with}} digital parametric models of Islamic construction {{is critically important}} for designing contemporary project of Islamic styles. This work aims to develop BIM-driven library of Islamic Architecture styles for architects, engineers, and other related <b>trades.</b> The <b>intent</b> {{of this research is}} the classification and organization of Islamic construction styles using spatial and temporal categories to represent the styles of different Islamic cultures. The prototype used to demonstrate the BIM-IA library is the Hijazi Architecture Character of the Ottoman period. Hijazi architecture is categorized based on components type and each component is characterized with various geometric, materials, and historic information parameters that can be readily adapted. This informatics platform can be implemented in any projects seeking Islamic style while also serving as method by which Islamic architecture can be integrated into contemporary aesthetics.|$|R
50|$|The saline {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the records in 1381 and, from that time on, salt was extracted from brine in Sülze. The development of Sülze's salt spring was strongly encouraged by the dukes of the Principality of Lüneburg who {{wanted to create a}} counterbalance to the town of Lüneburg, which had largely succeeded in maintaining its independence from territorial lords {{as a result of the}} salt <b>trade.</b> This <b>intent</b> was never realised, however, because a glance at the quantities of salt produced demonstrates the overwhelming supremacy of the Lüneburg Saltworks. Whilst an average of 110,000 t of salt was extracted annually in Lüneburg, Sülze generated no more than 4,000 t. In addition, the salt content of the brine in Lüneburg was up to 25% whereas in Sülze it was a mere 5% and thus barely economical.|$|R
40|$|The 1996 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture was a {{step toward}} free trade. The Agreement lifts bans and quotas on imports, but allows their {{conversion}} into tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), which function like quotas. At present, many of the 1, 300 TRQs increased market access to imports, but some have preserved pre-Agreement levels of protection. The World <b>Trade</b> Organization's <b>intent</b> as to the administration of TRQs is open to interpretation. This report analyzes seven administrative methods {{in light of the}} principle of nondiscrimination. We conclude that auctions are the best way to administer a TRQ. First-come, first-served and license-on-demand methods present a moderate risk of biased trade. State trading organizations and producer groups that directly administer TRQs can also bias trade. Historical allocation is the method most likely to be discriminatory. Two case studies illustrate our conclusion. Tariff-rate quotas, quantitative restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe paper conducts {{an analysis of}} the current counterdrug operation in Afghanistan and analyzes how these operations affect the counterinsurgent operations against the Taliban. This analysis will be conducted by examining the Taliban's control of opium cultivation to support their operations, determine how the people of Afghanistan rely upon the profits of opium for their livelihood, and identify possible solutions to the opium trade that will not alienate the people of Afghanistan from the Afghan government or Coalition Forces. This study will utilize a case study on Colombia in order to examine the policies implemented in an attempt to control the country's illicit cocaine <b>trade.</b> The <b>intent</b> of this study can be explained in four steps. First is to examine counterdrug strategies. Second is to conduct a case study of Colombia in order to examine the strategies used to counter their illicit drug trade. Third is to gain an understanding of what drives the Afghan people to produce opium, and how the Taliban exploits this need. Fourth is the recommendation of a proper counterdrug strategy to be implemented in Afghanistan. US Army (USA) author...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first modern}} {{trademark}} laws {{emerged in the}} late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark {{system in the world}} was passed into law in 1857 with the [...] "Manufacture and Goods Mark Act". In Britain, the Merchandise Marks Act 1862 made it a criminal offense to imitate another's <b>trade</b> mark 'with <b>intent</b> to defraud or to enable another to defraud'. In 1875, the Trade Marks Registration Act was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise prima facie evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The 1875 Act defined a registrable trade mark as 'a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket'.|$|R
40|$|The {{first round}} of {{negotiations}} held in Ottawa on the 19 th October, 2009, heralded the opening of bilateral <b>trade</b> talks <b>intent</b> on reaching a Canadian-European Union (EU 27) free trade area (FTA) agreement. A second round of negotiations were staged in Brussels in January, whilst further rounds are scheduled for 2010, with the longer term aim of ratifying an agreement within 24 - 30 months. Although stumbling blocs will be encountered, the divergent political interests of each region are compatible. In Canada, a FTA with its second largest trading partner offers {{a viable alternative to}} its current overdependence on the US. Similarly, the EU 27 sees an opportunity to regain a competitive foothold in the North American market. This paper re-examines the long run trade led gains from a Canada-EU 27 FTA. Unlike previous studies, our assessment also accounts for the HS 6 level sensitive product declarations submitted by both parties in the first round. We examine {{the extent to which these}} proposals afford protection to key strategic sectors and impact on trade led growth and real incomes. All estimates are compared with a realistic contemporary baseline scenario. The results suggest that non tariff barrier (NTB) reductions dominate real income gains, whilst sensitive product exceptions, principally affecting wheat, dairy, wearing apparel and leather sectors, reduce Canadian and EU 27 real income gains by 20 % and 24 %, respectively. Trade diversion impacts are relatively marked for the US and EFTA, whilst China escapes largely unscathed due to the pattern of its trade specialisation.

40|$|The study compares {{cost and}} {{benefits}} {{of carbon dioxide and}} vacuum packaged boxed beef distribution to retail grocery outlets In the retail grocery segment of the beef distribution channel, the major portion still moves fresh in the form of hanging quarters or primals. However, a recently important method of shipment to the retail grocery segment is beef in boxed, palletized form. Although nc accurate data are available to document the proportion of beef which is distri-buted boxed versus hanging, industry corr-sensus is that the boxed, palletized method will continue to increase in im-portance (4). This study provides tl~eresults,~fa comparative cost-benefit analysis of carbon dioxide and vacuum packaged boxed beef, both of which hold promise for in-creased utilization in the <b>trade.</b> The <b>intent</b> is not to identify one method. as superior in all situations to the other, but rather to analyze relative costs and savings associated with the two methods. The specific objectives were: 1) to identify additional costs associated with utilization of carbon dioxide dnd vacuum packaged boxed beef at the packer level, and 2) to evaluate the two systems with respect to shrink, trim 10 SS, and retail case life so as to provide a cost-benefit comparison of the two boxed beef methods, The carbon dioxide method of boxed beef consists of placing a sheet of polyethylene in a cardboard box.,placins either a primal or subprimal cut on tl~c polyethylene which is then folded over tllc meat. Just prior to box closure, a small perforated polyethylene bag of carbon dioxide pellets (typically about two pounds) is placed in the box which may then be l~al-Ietized. The vacuum packaged method is beLter known and consists of drawing a partial vacuum on a laminated barrier bag containin~ either a primal <Jrsubprimal cut. Tht’se vacuum packaged cuts then may be placed i[~ boxes or other master containers for pal-letized storage and/or shipmerrL...|$|R
40|$|Hitz {{addresses}} the urgent {{issues that the}} Laser and Electro-Optics Manufacturer’s Association (LEOMA) tackled in the late 1980 s, which will help guide future trade associations to handle related political and infrastructural issues from the industry. LEOMA- the Laser and Electro-Optics Manufacturers’ Association – {{is in many ways}} similar to trade associations that exist, or will exist, in other emerging, high-technology industries. Having dealt successfully with these initial obstacles, LEOMA went on to tackle other issues, perhaps less urgent, that confronted the industry. LEOMA and the US Laser Industry: The Good and Bad Moves for Trade Associations in Emerging High-Tech Industries describes the approaches, both successful and not, to the political and infrastructure issues addressed by the <b>trade</b> association. The <b>intent</b> is to provide guidance to those confronting similar issues, and help them avoid unsuccessful approaches. The key fea ures highlight the problems that were dealt with, and solutions, both successful and unsuccessful, that were created by LEOMA. Begins with an introductory chapter on LEOMA, followed by subsequent chapters describing specific issues that were handled by the trade association Includes end-of-chapter summaries, useful to similar trade associations Example of documents and approaches that LEOMA used successfully are included and could serve as a guide to other trade associations. Author is a renowned expert in the laser industry. He served as Executive Director for LEOMA for 25 years (1980 - 2005). Hitz outlines the problems and issues that confronted the U. S. laser industry as it evolved from a loose collection of founder-managed companies into a mature industry...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} markets, organizations, and people {{involved}} in the American drug trade in three sites: El Paso, Phoenix, and Chicago. The multisited analysis explores the relationships that exist within each site and provides an overview of how the drug trade differs in various contexts. This study illustrates that, contrary to the rhetoric of politicians and law enforcement actors over the past decade, there is not a vast, singular criminal conspiracy that organizes the drug <b>trade</b> with the <b>intent</b> of taking over cities in the U. S. Instead, there exists a flexible network of actors that operates largely in the margins of society. These actors participate in the network for various lengths of time and supply the ongoing demand for illicit drugs and/or the protection required for such activities in various U. S. markets. These participants include street and prison gangs, transportation organizations, and other groups and individuals, who often work as subcontractors, for employers they may not know, accepting risky tasks for what they may view as a lucrative opportunity. Moreover, this study shows that settings are important in determining how actors in the drug trade behave. This study demonstrates that when the state can effectively respond to violent acts, the criminal entrepreneurs seek to minimize publicly visible acts of violence, thus shifting acts of violence from the street to places out of public view or to prisons or jails. Ultimately, context {{must be taken into account}} if policy which seeks to reduce the harms of the drug trade in terms of unwanted usage and violence are to be effectively operationalized...|$|R
