5|$|Maximilian held out, making {{another attempt}} to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into {{negotiations}} with Francis. The resulting <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to {{the remainder of the}} Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for Cremona), effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the Italian War of 1521–26. The Italian Wars, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{made the}} <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> with Spain in 1656. This {{gathered}} Spanish {{support for a}} restoration in return for Charles's contribution to the war against France. Charles raised a ragtag army from his exiled subjects; this small, underpaid, poorly-equipped and ill-disciplined force formed {{the nucleus of the}} post-Restoration army. The Commonwealth made the Treaty of Paris with France in 1657 to join them in war against Spain in the Netherlands. Royalist supporters in the Spanish force were led by Charles's younger brother James, Duke of York. At the Battle of the Dunes in 1658, as part of the larger Spanish force, Charles's army of around 2,000 clashed with Commonwealth troops fighting with the French. By the end of the battle Charles's force was about 1,000 and with Dunkirk given to the English the prospect of a Royalist expedition to England was dashed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> was {{amended by}} the Protocol signed in Paris at the {{conclusion}} of the London and Paris Conferences on 23 October 1954, which added West Germany and Italy to the Western Union, which was renamed the Western European Union.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Amsterdam {{established}} <b>Brussels</b> as {{the seat}} of all normal European Council meetings and as the signing coincided {{with one of those}} meetings, there was disagreement as to the venue. Belgium, keen not to set any precedent of holding mandatory meetings outside <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> against the <b>treaty,</b> wanted the meeting in Brussels whereas the Portuguese EU presidency wanted it in Lisbon in order to call the <b>treaty,</b> the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Lisbon.|$|R
5|$|Separately, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Nice {{establishes}} <b>Brussels</b> as {{the venue}} for all formal summits of the European Council after 2004. However some extraordinary sessions are sometimes held outside the city. The European Council's seat is however fixed by a declaration {{rather than a}} protocol, meaning it is less binding than the other seats.|$|R
5|$|The Veneto–Papal {{alliance}} eventually {{expanded into}} the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about {{the division of}} the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France. Under the leadership of Francis I, who had succeeded Louis to the throne, the French and Venetians would, through victory at Marignano in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the <b>treaties</b> <b>of</b> Noyon and <b>Brussels,</b> which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels,</b> {{which was}} signed on 17 March 1948 between Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, was {{a prelude to}} the {{establishment}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an intergovernmental military alliance, and was a preview of the western European defense against communism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels,</b> {{signed on}} 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is {{considered}} the precursor to the NATO agreement, which Belgium became an official member of on April 4, 1949. The headquarters of NATO are located in Brussels, and the headquarters of SHAPE near Mons.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> {{was signed}} by the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on 17 March 1948. It was a mutual {{intergovernmental}} self-defence treaty which also promoted economic, cultural and social collaboration. The Brussels Pact had cultural and social clauses, and provisions for the setting up of a Consultative Council. The basis for this was that a cooperation organization between Western nations would help {{stop the spread of}} Communism.|$|E
50|$|Louis mounted another {{invasion}} of Milan, but was defeated at the Battle of Novara, which was quickly {{followed by a}} series of Holy League victories at La Motta, Guinegate, and Flodden, in which the French, Venetian, and Scottish forces were decisively defeated. However, the death of Pope Julius left the League without effective leadership, and when Louis' successor, Francis I, defeated the Swiss at Marignano in 1515, the League collapsed, and by the <b>treaties</b> <b>of</b> Noyon and <b>Brussels,</b> surrendered to France and Venice the entirety of northern Italy.|$|R
50|$|On 28 October 1971, {{after a year}} of {{negotiations}} between the UK Government led by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, the European Communities and various European leaders (particularly the French President Georges Pompidou), Members of Parliament after six days of debate in the House of Commons voted 356-244, a majority of 112 in favour of the principle of the United Kingdom becoming a member state of the European Communities (the Common Market) on the terms which had been provisionally agreed. This led to Edward Heath signing the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Accession in <b>Brussels</b> on behalf <b>of</b> the United Kingdom on 22 January 1972, with the treaty having full legal effect from 1 January 1973.|$|R
50|$|The French {{followed}} up the capture <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> by taking other key cities and fortresses in the Austrian Netherlands including Mons and Namur. Brussels remained under French occupation {{until it was}} returned to Austria by the 1748 <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Aix-la-Chapelle {{along with the rest}} of the Austrian Netherlands, although it was January 1749 before the French finally evacuated the city.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{it finally}} discredited Soviet moves {{to prevent the}} {{formation}} of a West German state and accelerated the construction of a West European alliance, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels,</b> the following month; mutual security was the new watchword. Until early 1948, Western and Soviet representatives had communicated in regular meetings at the foreign minister level; the Czech coup constituted a final rupture in relations between the two superpowers, with the West now signaling its determination to commit itself to collective self-defence. By early March, even a previously wavering France was demanding a concrete military alliance with definite promises to help in certain circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the Second World War made {{collective}} security a priority for Belgian foreign policy. In March 1948 Belgium signed the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels,</b> and then joined NATO in 1948. However {{the integration of the}} armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the Korean War. The Belgians, along with the Luxembourg government, sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea known as the Belgian United Nations Command. This mission was the first {{in a long line of}} UN missions which the Belgians supported. Currently, the Belgian Naval Component is working closely together with the Dutch Navy under the command of the Admiral Benelux.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, {{obligatory}} {{military service}} was introduced. In 1945, the Corps de la Garde Grand Ducale (Grand Ducal Guard Corps) garrisoned in the Saint-Esprit barracks in Luxembourg City and the 1st and 2nd infantry battalions were established, one in Walferdange {{and the other}} in Dudelange. The Luxembourg Army took charge of part of the French zone of occupation in Germany, the 2nd Battalion occupying part of the Bitburg district and a detachment from the 1st Battalion part of the Saarburg district. The 2nd Battalion remained in Bitburg until 1955. Luxembourg signed the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> in March 1948, and the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949.|$|E
50|$|Since the Arenbergs {{were now}} indisputably the first among the nobility of the Habsburg Netherlands, it became {{customary}} for the Dukes {{to receive the}} Order of the Golden Fleece shortly after their succession to the title. Staunch supporters of the Habsburgs, they held high offices at the Court <b>of</b> <b>Brussels,</b> sat on the Counsel of State, were employed on embassies (notably the embassy to King James I of England that negotiated the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> London of 1604) and acted as provincial governors in Hainaut and the Franche-Comté. Occupying high military commands could likewise be called something like their birthright.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and 19th century, {{treaties}} and war codes started to include vague provisions {{for the protection}} <b>of</b> women: The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Amity and Commerce (1785) specified that in case of war [...] "women and children....shall not be molested in their persons". Article 20 of the Order No. 20 (1847), a supplement to the US Rules and Articles of war, listed the following as severely punishable [...] "Assassination, murder, malicious stabbing or maiming, rape". The Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> (1874) stated that the [...] "honours and rights of the family....should be respected".|$|R
50|$|In {{the former}} Austrian Netherlands, conquered by France in 1794 and annexed in 1795, the Allies made quick {{progress}} also. This presented {{the problem of}} what to do with this country. The thirty most prominent families <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> expressed the wish to restore the old Governorate-general of the Austrians and this was provisionally instituted by the Allies in February 1814 as their military government. However, Austria itself expressed little interest in resuming its rule. Therefore, the Allies provisionally apportioned the country to the new Dutch state in the secret annexes to the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Chaumont. This was further formalised in the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Paris of 30 May 1814, in which Belgium on the left bank of the river Meuse was apportioned to the (future) Netherlands, whereas the fate of the right bank area was to be determined later.|$|R
25|$|The Netherlands {{abandoned}} its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels,</b> {{and became a}} founding member of NATO in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in Cold War Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division of the United States Army during the Korean War. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War, it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, and it was engaged in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The Community's initial aim was {{to bring}} about {{economic}} integration, including a common market and customs union, among its six founding members: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. It gained {{a common set of}} institutions along with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) as one of the European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty (<b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels).</b> In 1993, a complete single market was achieved, known as the internal market, which allowed for the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EEC. In 1994, the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement. This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the European Free Trade Association, forming the European Economic Area covering 15 countries.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> was {{a mutual}} defence treaty against the Soviet threat {{at the start}} of the Cold War. It was signed on 17March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. It was the {{precursor}} to NATO. The Soviet threat became immediate with the Berlin Blockade in 1948, leading to the creation of the Western European Union's Defence Organization in September 1948. However, the parties were too weak militarily to counter the military power of the USSR. In addition, the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état by the Communists had overthrown a democratic government and British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin reiterated that the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western military strategy. He got a receptive hearing in the United States, especially considering American anxiety over Italy (and the Italian Communist Party).|$|E
50|$|For example, on 1 January 2002, the WEU's Security Studies Institute and the Satellite Centre were {{transferred}} to the EU and became the European Union Institute for Security Studies and the European Union Satellite Centre. Notably, the role given to the WEU in the Amsterdam Treaty, was removed by the Nice <b>Treaty.</b> The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Lisbon has provisions for cooperation between the EU and both NATO (including the Berlin Plus agreement) and the WEU. However the defence commitment, of Article 4 <b>of</b> the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Treaty,</b> has not been subsumed. Article 42(7) <b>of</b> the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> the European Union, as amended by the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Lisbon, {{could be viewed as}} incorporating that defence commitment into the EU framework.|$|R
2500|$|In 1508, Pope Julius II {{formed the}} League of Cambrai, in which France, the Papacy, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire agreed {{to attack the}} Republic of Venice and {{partition}} her mainland territories. [...] The resulting War of the League of Cambrai was a kaleidoscope of shifting alliances. [...] The French defeated the Venetian army at the Battle of Agnadello, capturing extensive territories; but Julius, now regarding France as a greater threat, left the League and allied himself with Venice. [...] After a year of fighting over the Romagna, he proclaimed a Holy League against the French; this rapidly grew to include England, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire. [...] The French were driven from Italy in late 1512, despite their victory at the Battle of Ravenna earlier that year, leaving Milan {{in the hands of}} Maximilian Sforza and his Swiss mercenaries; but the Holy League fell apart over the subject of dividing the spoils, and in 1513 Venice allied with France, agreeing to partition Lombardy between them. [...] The French invasion of Milan in 1513 was defeated at the Battle of Novara, which was followed by a series of defeats for the French alliance; but Francis I of France defeated the Swiss at the Battle of Marignano in 1515, and the <b>treaties</b> <b>of</b> Noyon and <b>Brussels</b> left France and Venice in control of northern Italy.|$|R

500|$|In 1948, European leaders {{met with}} U.S. defense, {{military}} and diplomatic {{officials at the}} Pentagon, under U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall's orders, exploring a framework for a new and unprecedented association. Talks for a new military alliance resulted in the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman in Washington, D.C. on 4April 1949. It included the five <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels</b> states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was [...] "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down". Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949. The creation of NATO {{can be seen as}} the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called Atlanticism which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.|$|E
500|$|The members {{agreed that}} an armed attack against {{any one of}} them in Europe or North America would be {{considered}} an attack against them all. Consequently, they agreed that, if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence, would assist the member being attacked, taking such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from ArticleIV of the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels,</b> which clearly states that the response will be military in nature. It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their [...] "vessels, forces or aircraft" [...] above the Tropic of Cancer, including some overseas departments of France.|$|E

50|$|As Prime Minister, Kosor {{failed to}} commit to {{structural}} reforms and introduced new taxes {{as a response to}} the ongoing economic crisis. During her tenure, she strongly advocated a zero tolerance policy to political corruption and organized crime. This uncompromising stance, along with the new criminal code passed before her term began, opened the door to unprecedented efforts to combat corruption. This resulted in numerous arrests of influential business-people and politicians from across the political spectrum, although most of them members of HDZ, which severely damaged the party's reputation. The discoveries made by prosecutors were far-reaching and criminal charges were even raised against former Prime Minister and Kosor's own political mentor Ivo Sanader, who would later be charged with 10 years in prison for criminal activity and abuse of power. In foreign policy, Kosor and her Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor were successful in solving the long-standing border dispute and she is credited with successfully finishing the negotiating process of the Croatian accession to the European Union. On 9 December 2011, she and President Ivo Josipović signed the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Accession in <b>Brussels.</b> A moderate conservative, Kosor ran for another term as party leader after losing the election, however was defeated by the more conservative Tomislav Karamarko.
