40|$|IP {{multicast}} {{is still}} not widespread in the Internet. Its slow acceptance is caused by immature multicast network infrastructure but also by inadequate end-user applications. In this paper we present an architecture for unicast extensions to IP multicast {{that can be used}} to solve several detected multicast-related problems. The architecture is based on a data forwarding tool, the Multicast-Unicast Reflector, providing a solution to the problems at the network level. We also present solutions at the application level, providing web-based access to announced multicast sessions, integration of multicast multimedia sessions with participants with a Voice over IP, PSTN or cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>terminal</b> and, finally, use of the proposed architecture to provide a scalable H. 323 Multipoint Control Unit. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{signal processing}} methods for speech extraction in use with voice communication {{applications such as}} personal digital assistants (PDA), mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>terminals</b> and personal computers. The user is distant from the device and thus the speech signal entering the device {{may be subject to}} reverberation and may be disturbed by background noise. The proposed structure consists of a microphone array which allows for techniques of directional processing. Thus it is able to enhance a desired speech source and suppress other speech sources in the background. Three different optimal beamforming methods are considered in a real world car hands-free environment: an optimal near-field array gain optimization procedure, a theoretical diffuse noise field model for a point source and a least squares solutio...|$|R
5000|$|Commonly, microfilters {{are only}} {{low-pass}} filters, so beyond them only low frequencies (voice signals) can pass. In the data section, a microfilter {{is not used}} because digital devices that are intended to extract data from the DSL signal will, themselves, filter out low frequencies. Voice telephone devices {{will pick up the}} entire spectrum so high frequencies, including the ADSL signal, will be [...] "heard" [...] as noise in <b>telephone</b> <b>terminals,</b> and will affect and often degrade the service in fax, dataphones and modems. From {{the point of view of}} DSL devices, any acceptance of their signal by POTS devices mean that there is a degradation of the DSL signal to the devices, and this is the central reason why these filters are required.|$|R
50|$|Switch56 {{was built}} {{on top of the}} basic Nortel {{hardware}} to allow computers to put data into the existing telephony network. Although slow compared to even contemporary systems, Switch56 allowed network traffic to flow not only within an office like other LAN systems, but between any branch offices that were connected using a Nortel PBX like the Meridian Norstar. This was a much easier option to install than ISDN for most offices, requiring nothing more than a Switch56 bridge to their existing network. For the LAN role new <b>telephone</b> <b>terminals</b> were produced with a RS-232C port on the back, which were then plugged into the user's computer and used with custom software. Although interesting in theory, it appears Switch56 saw little use in this role.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in Sweden as Comvik in 1981 {{as an attempt to}} break the existing monopoly at the time. During the 1980s, investor Jan Stenbeck's strategy was to pursue, break up and create alternatives to the existing Swedish monopolies in service sectors including telephony and media. In the late 1970s Mr Stenbecks Investment AB Kinnevik started to buy a number of smaller companies in Stockholm and Gothenburg that operated manual communication networks for car based equipment. Through an operator the driver could reach the public telephone network. Eventually these companies were merged and rebranded AB Företagstelefon in Stockholm. In parallel - and in the quiet - the plans were more ambitious. Completely new equipment was purchased, new <b>telephone</b> <b>terminals</b> were developed and then in 1981 Kinnevik launched Comvik.

30|$|For {{a hearing}} {{impaired}} person, {{and for a}} normal hearing person in adverse acoustic conditions, it is often necessary {{to be able to}} lip-read as well as hear the person they are talking with in order to communicate successfully. Apart from the lip movements, nonverbal visual information is also essential to keep a normal flow of conversation. Often, only the audio signal is available, for example, during telephone conversations or certain TV broadcasts. The idea behind SynFace is to try to recreate the visible articulation of the speaker, {{in the form of an}} animated talking head. The visual signal is presented in synchrony with the acoustic speech signal, which means that the user can benefit from the combined synchronised audiovisual perception of the original speech acoustics and the resynthesised visible articulation. When compared to video telephony solutions, SynFace has the distinct advantage that only the user on the receiving end needs special equipment—the speaker at the other end can use any <b>telephone</b> <b>terminal</b> and technology: fixed, mobilem, or IP-telephony.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{proposes a}} variable step-size adaptation control method for acoustic echo cancellation digital filters for handset and hands-free <b>telephone</b> <b>terminals.</b> The variable step-size integrates a double-talk detector, an echo-path change detector and an automatic {{control of the}} background noise level. The invention is based on two supplementary adaptive filters with low memory length, which support the acoustic echo cancellation filter control. One supplementary filter monitors the near-end speech activity, while the other monitors the echo-path variations. Such control method provides several benefits: 1. A reliable adaptation control for {{a broad range of}} acoustic coupling levels between the loudspeaker/s and the microphone. 2. An adaptation control able to cope also with sudden and strong changes of the echo path. 3. An adaptation control with low computational complexity characterized by a reduced number of easily adjustable parameters. 4. An adaptation control that does not need any a-priori estimate of the acoustic coupling level between the loudspeaker/s and the microphone. 5. An adaptation control that can be applied to any gradient descendent adaptive algorithm...|$|R

The objective is to obtain real time visualization of DC and AC electrical variables and a lossless data stream acquisition. The acquisition system hardware elements have been configured, tested and installed on the grid platform.

The FPGA application consists of two tasks running at different rates and a FIFO has been implemented to communicate between them without data loss.
