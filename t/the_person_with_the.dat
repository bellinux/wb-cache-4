5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: to {{determine}} the peculiarities of the psychophysiological self-regulation of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> of <b>the</b> type A behavior from {{the positions of the}} systemic approach under the conditions of the psychoemotional stress, to reveal the possibilities of the self-regulation processes correction by the method of the transcranial electrostimulation of the brain. It has been determined, that the components of the type A behaviour are not closely connected. In all psychoemotional situations, <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> type A behaviour are inclined to the larger mobilization of the psychophysiological effort. The transcranial electrostimulation reduces <b>the</b> hyper-reactivity of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> type A behaviour and decreases the psychophysiological "price" of the activity. For the first time, the investigation of the phenomena of self-regulation of <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> type A behaviour has been performed and the possibility of the self-regulation correction, using the transcranial electrostimulation method, has been determined.

5|$|During {{the early}} and {{moderate}} stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disease {{or the use of}} modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.|$|E

5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's.

The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E

5|$|The Joes {{locate the}} secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three {{missiles}} with nanowarheads, which are aimed for Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, DC, the world's {{three most important}} cities.

After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.|$|E
