40|$|Line 63 - 1 is a 'Sunset'-derived {{transgenic}} papaya {{expressing the}} coat protein (CP) gene from a mild mutant of a Hawaiian isolate of Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV). Previous work showed that line 63 - 1 R, plants exhibited {{a range of}} resistance to severe PRSV isolates from Hawaii (HA), Jamaica (JA), <b>Thailand</b> (<b>TH),</b> and Brazil (BR). Genetic and molecular data obtained in this study confirm that line 63 - 1 has two CP transgene insertion sites; segregation analysis shows that the CP and the npt H genes are present at both loci. To study the potential effect of gene dosage on resistance, various populations of R- 1, R- 2, and R- 3 seedlings were challenged by PRSV HA, BR, and TH. A R, population obtained by self-pollination of line 63 - 1 hermaphrodite R- 0 plant exhibited resistance to all three isolates. The percentage of plants resistant to all three PRSV isolates increased in 63 - 1 -derived populations {{as a result of}} recurrent selection. Additional genetic studies demonstrate that the number of resistant plants in a 63 - 1 -derived population is directly correlated with the number of plants with multiple transgene copies. We conclude that transgene dosage {{plays a major role in}} affecting the resistance of 63 - 1 to PRSV isolates from various geographical locations...|$|E
40|$|Melon {{yellow spot}} virus (MYSV), a {{tentative}} {{member of the}} genus Tospovirus, is considered a distinct serotype {{due to the lack}} of a serological relationship with other tospoviruses in its nucleocapsid protein (NP). Recently, a virus isolate collected from diseased watermelon in central Taiwan (MYSV-TW) was found to react with a rabbit antiserum (RAs) prepared against the NP of Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV), and a monoclonal antibody (MAb) prepared against the common epitope of the NSs proteins of WSMoV-serogroup tospoviruses, but not with the WSMoV NP-specific MAb, in both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting. In this investigation, both RAs and MAb against MYSV-TW NP were produced. Results of serological tests revealed that the RAs to MYSV-TW NP reacted with the homologous antigen and the crude antigens of members of the WSMoV serogroup, including members of the formal species WSMoV and Peanut bud necrosis virus, and members of three tentative species, Watermelon bud necrosis virus, Capsicum chlorosis virus and Calla lily chlorotic spot virus. The MAb to MYSV-TW NP reacted only with the homologous antigen and the other geographic isolates of MYSV from Japan (JP) and <b>Thailand</b> (<b>TH).</b> Our results of reciprocal tests indicate that the NP and the NSs protein of MYSV are serologically related to those of WSMoV-serogroup tospoviruses. Furthermore, we show that both the MYSV NP MAb and the WSMoV NP MAb are reliable tools for identification of MYSV and WSMoV from single or mixed infection in field surveys, as verified using species-specific primers in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{coat protein}} (CP) gene {{mediated}} transgenic resistance {{is found to}} be the best approach for protecting papaya plants against the destructive disease caused by Papaya ringspot viruses (PRSV). In order to study the variability of PRSV and the potential threat to the CP-transgenic resistance, five virus isolates were collected from transgenic plants of papaya line 16 - 0 - 1, which carry the CP gene of the typical mosaic strain of Taiwan PRSV YK, in an approved test field and fourteen from untransformed papaya plants in different areas of Taiwan. The results of biological, serological, and molecular characterization indicated that all isolates are related to PRSV YK. Among them, the isolate 5 - 19 from the transgenic line and the isolates CS and TD 2 from untransformed papaya were able to overcome the YK CP gene-mediated resistance of papaya lines 18 - 2 - 4, 17 - 0 - 5, and 16 - 0 - 1, which provide high degrees of resistance to different geographic PRSV strains of Hawaii (HA), Mexico (MX), and <b>Thailand</b> (<b>TH).</b> These three isolates were also able to cause symptoms on untransformed papaya plants more severe than those induced by YK. In addition to the host reactions, the variability of the collected 19 isolates was also analyzed and compared with YK and other geographic strains by heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) and sequence analyses. The results of HMA indicated that the CP genes of isolates 5 - 19 and TD 2 are more divergent than those of other isolates when compared with YK. However, sequence analyses of the transgenic-resistance overcoming isolates 5 - 19, CS, and TD 2 revealed that their CP coding regions and the 3 ' untranslated regions (UTRs) share nucleotide identities of 93. 9 - 96. 6 % and 94. 2 - 97. 9 % with those of YK, respectively; whereas the other geographic strains of HA, MX, and TH that could not overcome the transgenic resistance share lower nucleotide identities of 89. 8 - 92. 6 % and 92. 3 - 95. 3 % with those of YK, respectively. Our results indicate that the ability for overcoming the transgenic resistance is not solely correlated with higher degrees of sequence divergence from the transgene. The possible mechanism for overcoming the transgenic resistance and the potential threat of these PRSV strains to the application of the transgenic papaya lines carrying PRSV YK CP gene are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Background: Snake {{envenomation}} is {{a serious}} public health threat {{in the rural areas}} of Asian and African countries. To date, the only proven treatment for snake envenomation is antivenom therapy. Cross-neutralization of heterologous venoms by antivenom raised against venoms of closely related species has been reported. The present study examined the cross neutralizing potential of a newly developed polyvalent antivenom, termed Neuro Polyvalent Snake Antivenom (NPAV). NPAV was produced by immunization against 4 Thai elapid venoms. Principal Findings: In vitro neutralization study using mice showed that NPAV was able to neutralize effectively the lethality of venoms of most common Asiatic cobras (Naja spp.), Ophiophagus hannah and kraits (Bungarus spp.) from Southeast Asia, but only moderately to weakly effective against venoms of Naja from India subcontinent and Africa. Studies with several venoms showed that the in vivo neutralization potency of the NPAV was comparable to the in vitro neutralization potency. NPAV could also fully protect against N. sputatrix venom-induced cardio-respiratory depressant and neuromuscular blocking effects in anesthetized rats, demonstrating that the NPAV could neutralize most of the major lethal toxins in the Naja venom. Conclusions/Significance: The newly developed polyvalent antivenom NPAV may find potential application in the treatment of elapid bites in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, a neighboring nation of <b>Thailand.</b> Nevertheless, <b>th...</b>|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) epidemic in Southeast Asia has been {{largely due to the}} emergence of clade E (HIV- 1 E). It has been suggested that HIV- 1 E is derived from a recombinant lineage of subtype A (HIV- 1 A) and subtype E, with multiple breakpoints along the E genome. We obtained complete genome sequences of clade E viruses from <b>Thailand</b> (93 <b>TH</b> 057 and 93 TH 065) and from the Central African Republic (90 CF 11697 and 90 CF 4071), increasing the total number of HIV- 1 E complete genome sequences available to seven. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genomes showed that subtypes A and E are themselves monophyletic, although together they also form a larger monophyletic group. The apparent phylogenetic incongruence at different regions of the genome that was previously taken as evidence of recombination is shown to be not statistically significant. Furthermore, simulations indicate that bootscanning and pairwise distance results, previously used as evidence for recombination, can be misleading, particularly when there are differences in substitution or evolutionary rates across the genomes of different subtypes. Taken jointly, our analyses suggest that there is inadequate support for the hypothesis that subtype E variants are derived from a recombinant lineage. In contrast, many other HIV strains claimed to have a recombinant origin, including viruses for which only a single parental strain was employed for analysis, do indeed satisfy the statistical criteria we propose. Thus, while intersubtype recombinant HIV strains are indeed circulating, the criteria for assigning a recombinant origin to viral structures should include statistical testing of alternative hypotheses to avoid inappropriate assignments that would obscure the true evolutionary properties of these viruses...|$|R

The samples were collected from one <b>Thailand</b> population (<b>TH)</b> which sequences {{were obtained from the}} GenBank database, five domestic stocks [Fujian (FJ), Guangxi (GX), Hainan (HN), Daya Bay (DW), and Zhanjiang (ZJ) ] and two wild populations [Guangxi (GY) and Daya Bay (DY) ]. Sixty polymorphic sites were found in COI gene, and thirty-nine haplotypes were detected in all samples. In addition, twenty-four polymorphic sites were found, and twenty-seven haplotypes were detected in all samples of 16 S rRNA gene. The analysis of haplotype frequency distribution and molecular variation indicated that genetic variation and geographic structure were significant. To COI gene and combined data set, the majority (COI: 78. 7 %, combined data set: 78. 5 %) of the genetic variation was distributed within populations, furthermore, less than 37. 0 % genetic variation of 16 S rRNA could be distributed within populations. Variance of 16 S rRNA gene (4. 3 %), COI gene (26. 1 %), and combined data set (23. 4 %) could be attributed among different geographic regions. The richest variation of 16 S rRNA was observed in TH population among the eight populations supported the fact that TH has richer genetic polymorphism than Chinese population, which may sustain the idea of stock introduction. Otherwise, in the present study, we found that the gene diversity (Hd) level of wild population was higher than cultured populations of C. nobilis in three data sets. Our results indicated that genetic composition of cultured C. nobilis populations in southern China have been significantly affected by hatchery performance.

It will be a challenge for Thailand to achieve the UN Millennium Development target for TB, {{as well as the}} new WHO targets for eliminating TB by 2035. More knowledge and a new approach are needed to tackle the complex challenges of managing the DOT program in Thailand. Contextual factors strongly influence the local implementation of evidence in practice. Using the PARIHS model, the aim has been to explore district leaders’ perceptions of the management of the DOT program in Trang province, Thailand. Methods A phenomenographic approach was used to explore the perceptions among district DOT program leaders in Trang province. We conducted semi-structured interviews with district leaders responsible for managing the DOT program in five districts. The analysis of the data transcriptions was done by grouping similarities and differences of perceptions, which were constructed in a hierarchical outcome space that shows a set of descriptive categories. Results The first descriptive category revealed a common perception of the leaders’ duty and wish to comply with the NTP guidelines when managing and implementing the DOT program in their districts. More varied perceptions among the leaders concerned how to achieve successful treatment. Other perceptions concerned practical dilemmas, which included fear of infection, mutual distrust, and inadequate knowledge about TB. Further, the leaders perceived a need for improved management practices in implementing the TB guidelines. Conclusion Using the PARIHS framework to gain a retrospective perspective on the district-level policy implementation of the DOT program and studying the leadership’s perceptions about applying the guidelines to practice, has brought new knowledge about management practices.

40|$|Thailand's {{politics}} in the early twenty-first century has seen considerable contestation. Underlying the street protests, military interventions and considerable bloodshed has been a struggle over the nature of electoral politics, popular sovereignty and representation. The military and monarchy have maintained a royalist alliance that opposes elections, popular sovereignty and civilian politicians, proposing Thai-style democracy as an alternative. Those who promote elections and popular sovereignty argue that these are a basis for democratisation. On 22 May 2014, Thailand's military staged yet another coup, unseating the government elected in 2011, led by Yingluck Shinawatra. By most calculations, this was <b>Thailand's</b> 12 <b>th</b> successful coup. The 11 th putsch in September 2006 ousted Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra. In considering these two most recent military interventions, it is striking that both were associated with a decade of large and sometimes aggressive street protests. As will be shown in this paper, {{at the core of}} these demonstrations has been competing ideas about democracy, elections and representation. Involving a range of actors, the most significant of the street protests have been, on the one hand, associated with the red-shirted supporters of Thaksin and, on the other hand, by their opponents, known as yellow shirts and more broadly identified—and self-identified—as royalists. Both groups have mobilised large numbers of supporters. If the leaders of Thailand's competing political groups had ever thought to peruse the pages of this journal, they would have found much that resonated with their struggles and debates of the past decade. Indeed, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) might have been claimed as something of a model by Thailand's most recent protesters, the ‘People's Committee for Absolute Democracy with the King as Head of State’ (PCAD). The PCAD argued that what they wanted was thorough-going political reform, and so its leaders might have agreed with the ERS view that ‘the present electoral system has little to recommend it[*]…[*]’. PCAD activists rejected Thailand's electoral system and opposed voting because these were considered obstacles for political reform. They would have noticed resonance with their own rhetoric when the ERS pointed to injustices associated with electoral minorities, and the PCAD would have been heartened to read that the British electoral system was sometimes described as ‘undemocratic’, a term the PCAD regularly used in criticising Yingluck's government (Electoral Reform Society 1970 : 1). They would also have noticed that at times the ERS questioned electoral mandates, for the PCAD consistently rejected the substantial election victory voters delivered for Yingluck in 2011 (Electoral Reform Society 1971 : 3). At the same time, Yingluck's Pheu Thai Party government and its supporters in the ‘United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship’ (UDD) would certainly have agreed with a 1970 ERS article that lamented the ‘tendency to substitute various forms of demonstration for the ballot box[*]…[*]’ (Electoral Reform Society 1970 : 1). They would have recognised the sentiment expressed in the article, ‘Let the voters arbitrate’, by the ERS's ‘EL’ (1975 : 37); after all, as the PCAD rallied to bring down the Yingluck government and prevented an election, her supporters repeatedly demanded that their votes and their right to vote be respected. In other words, even if the methods and outcomes may be quite different from those seen in Britain of the 1970 s, the contested claims about the nature of electoral politics and about appropriate forms of representation are familiar in early twenty-first-century Thailand. In this paper, the history and development of these competing claims will be examined. This historical contextualisation of Thailand's debates over representation is critical in understanding the nature of the past decade of intense political conflict, from 2005 to 2014. This recent period has seen seven prime ministers and was punctuated by two military coups. It is a conflict that has been destructive and divisive and has thrown competing claims about political representation into stark relief. In established democracies, the nature of this representation is sometimes contested but it seldom threatens a political regime. In Thailand, contestation over representation has led to violence, military intervention and deep political division. These struggles over representation have been about {{the very nature of the}} political order in Thailand...|$|R
