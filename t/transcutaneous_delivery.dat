Supplementary work probed 1 H NMR spectral data for tamoxifen in the presence of different proportions of polyunsaturated or unsaturated fatty acids. Typical, non-aqueous gels were modified to contain 1 % tamoxifen and three levels of borage oil (∼ 25 % γ linolenic acid) and the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>delivery</b> of both tamoxifen and GLA across full thickness skin determined in vitro. Both tamoxifen and γ linolenic acid permeated the skin with the ratio of moles being consistent at approximately 4 : 1.

Dose-dependent downfield shifts of tamoxifen aromatic protons were observed in the presence of borage oil and linolenic acid (γ and α), but not saturated triacyl glycerol. The permeation data suggested vehicular complexation between tamoxifen and polyunsaturated constituents of borage oil and that such complexes permeated the skin intact. The 1 H NMR data supported the hypothesis that such complexation was a consequence of preferential π–π orbital interactions between the phenyl groups of tamoxifen and the multiple double bonds of GLA.

40|$|AbstractNew {{vehicles}} for the non-invasive delivery of agents are introduced. These carriers can transport pharmacological agents, including large polypeptides, through the permeability barriers, {{such as the}} intact skin. This capability depends on the self-regulating carrier deformability which exceeds that of the related but not optimized lipid aggregates by several orders of magnitude. Conventional lipid suspensions, such as standard liposomes or mixed lipid micelles, do not mediate a systemic biological effect upon epicutaneous applications. In contrast to this, the properly devised adaptable carriers, when administered on the intact skin, transport therapeutic amounts of biogenic molecules into the body. This process can be nearly as efficient as an injection needle, {{as seen from the}} results of experiments in mice and humans with the insulin-carrying vesicles. The carrier-mediated <b>transcutaneous</b> insulin <b>delivery</b> is unlikely to involve shunts, lesions or other types of skin damage.

40|$|Vaccine {{formulations}} on {{the basis}} of nano- (NP) or microparticles (MP) can solve issues with stabilization, controlled release, and poor immunogenicity of antigens. Likewise transcutaneous immunization (TCI) promises superior immunogenicity as well as the advantages of needle-free application compared with conventional intramuscular injections. Thus the combination of both strategies seems to be a very valuable approach. However, until now TCI using particle based vaccine formulations has made no impact on medical practice. One of the main difficulties is that NPs and MPs cannot penetrate the skin to an extent that would allow the application of the required dose of antigen. This is due to the formidable stratum corneum (SC) barrier, the limited amount of antigen in the formulation and often an insufficient immunogenicity. A multitude of strategies are currently under investigation to overcome these issues. We highlight selected methods presenting a spectrum of solutions ranging from transfollicular delivery, to devices disrupting the SC barrier and the combination of particle based vaccines with adjuvants discussing their advantages and shortcomings.

However, the novel barrier function of stratum corneum hinders the transport of antigen and adjuvant in transcutaneous immunization. Novel nanoscale delivery systems employing, for example, liposomes and nanoparticles, have been widely investigated to overcome the penetration barrier of stratum corneum for effective transcutaneous immunization. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to prepare two types of flexible liposomes and determine their efficacies for the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>delivery</b> of antigen and the subsequent immune response induced in vivo. Methods: Ovalbumin (OVA) liposome-based transcutaneous vaccines were prepared using reverse-phase evaporation and film-dispersion methods. Particle sizes and antigen encapsulating efficiency were then evaluated. After application to bare mouse skin, topical sites were examined for the presence of fluorescence-labeled liposome. The efficacy of the transcutaneously delivered OVA-loaded flexible liposome in activating the immune responses was investigated by detecting serum immunoglobulin G levels. The influence of an adjuvant, imiquimod, in the transcutaneous immunization was also tested. Results: Two flexible liposomes with well-encapsulated OVA were successfully prepared by film-dispersion or reverse-phase evaporation methods. The sizes of the prepared flexible liposomes ranged from 200 to 400 nm. In vivo, the fluorescence-labeled liposome was detected in hair-follicle ducts, indicating that the flexible liposome can penetrate the skin barrier through the hair follicles. Upon transcutaneous administration, the OVA-encapsulated flexible liposome elicited a strong immune response similar to that of positive control (ie, OVA solution administrated by subcutaneous injection with Al(OH) 3 as an adjuvant). Co-administration of imiquimod with the OVA-loaded liposome expressed a significant enhancement on the transcutaneous immune responses. Conclusion: Results of this study highlight the nanoscale formulation, flexible liposome, as a promising carrier for the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>delivery</b> of antigen proteins.

In this set of animal studies, transcutaneous immunization (TCI) using recombinant colonization factor CS 6 and cholera toxin (CT) or heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) as the adjuvant induced immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA anti-CS 6 responses in sera and stools and antibody responses that recognized CS 6 antigen in its native configuration. The antitoxin immunity induced by TCI was also shown to protect against enteric toxin challenge. Although immunization with LT via the skin induced mucosal secretory IgA responses to LT, protection could also be achieved by intravenous injection of the immune sera. Finally, a malaria vaccine antigen, merzoite surface protein 142 administered with CT as the adjuvant, induced both merzoite surface protein antibodies and T-cell responses while conferring protective antitoxin immunity, suggesting that both antiparasitic activity and antidiarrheal activity can be obtained with a single vaccine formulation.

In addition, heating prior to or during topical application of a drug may facilitate skin penetration, increase kinetic energy, and facilitate drug absorption. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate skin vasomotor responses to mild heat generated by a controlled heat device on several body regions of healthy male and female subjects. Skin vasomotor responses in different body regions were recorded following different heat application paradigms (38, 41 and 43 °C, each for 15, 30, 60 sec). Test regions were forehead, forearm, dorsal hand, dorsal foot, and abdomen. Prior to and following the application of heat, local blood perfusion and skin temperature were measured by means of laser Doppler imaging (LDI) and thermography, respectively. It was found that a short-lasting heat application (43 °C for 60 sec) causes significant cutaneous hyperaemia (up to 2 folds increase in skin perfusion, and 5 °C increase in skin temperature) existing for up to 15 minutes.

Receptor phase samples were taken to determine permeation and depth profiles of ketoprofen were constructed, following tape stripping and membrane separation. Reduction of solvent from the Cabosil-thickened gels resulted in a rank order reduction in the permeation and distribution of ketoprofen. Reduced amounts of ketoprofen were distributed through the skin, particularly the dermis, with decreasing solvent. Two gels sharing the same macroviscosity exhibited significantly different skin permeation and distribution characteristics. The rank order reduction in both permeation and distribution of ketoprofen was attributed to the physiochemical properties of the formulation and how they may change after application, in particular the increased adsorptivity of ketoprofen to the Cabosil relative {{to the amount of}} solvent present in the system. This effect appeared to be predominant over any interactions occurring between the formulation and the skin.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common female {{malignancy}} in the western world. Currently, tamoxifen remains the gold standard anti-hormone for ER+ breast cancer. However de novo resistance to tamoxifen is a huge clinical problem. What is more, as many as 50 % of initial responders develop acquired resistance to tamoxifen and relapse. Aberrant growth factor signalling has been linked to the resistant phenotype, in particular EGFR and IGF-IR signalling and often gives a more aggressive disease type and poorer patient outlook. There is a substantial clinical need for new anti-breast cancer therapeutics that target the resistant phenotype or prevent this from occurring. One hypothesis is to combine both anti-hormonal therapies with anti-EGFR therapies, in hope of preventing resistant growth. Many downstream pathways of EGFR have been targeted to develop novel therapeutics against however, these compounds are almost certain to give severe adverse reactions, furthermore a complex tablet regime or IV injections {{have a negative effect on}} patient compliance.

In this context, the imidazoquinoline derivative imiquimod formulated in Aldara applied onto intact skin {{together with a}} cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope induces potent CTL responses. However, the feasibility and efficacy of the commercial imiquimod formulation Aldara is limited by its physicochemical properties {{as well as its}} immunogenicity. Methodology/Principal Findings: To overcome these obstacles, we developed an imiquimod-containing emulsion gel (IMI-Gel) and characterized it in comparison to Aldara for rheological properties and in vitro mouse skin permeation in a Franz diffusion cell system. Imiquimod was readily released from Aldara, while IMI-Gel showed markedly decreased drug release. Nevertheless, comparing vaccination potency of Aldara or IMI-Gel-based TCI in C 57 BL/ 6 mice against the model cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope SIINFEKL, we found that IMI-Gel was equally effective in terms of the frequency of peptide-specific T-cells and in vivo cytolytic activity.

We developed a device with three fine, stainless steel needles fabricated with a bevel angle facing outside (“three-microneedle device” [TMD]) to release a drug broadly and homogeneously into tissue in the horizontal plane. Use of this device could reduce the risk of complications when transcutaneous injections are undertaken. Patients and methods: Sixteen Japanese patients were enrolled. The mean volume of lidocaine hydrochloride per unit area needed to elicit anesthesia when using a TMD was compared with that the volume required when using a conventional 27 -gauge needle. The visual analog scale (VAS) score of needlestick pain and injection-associated pain was also compared. Results: The mean volume of lidocaine hydrochloride per unit area to elicit anesthesia using the TMD was significantly lower than that the volume required when using the conventional 27 -gauge needle.

40|$|Here we {{introduce}} a new approach for <b>transcutaneous</b> drug <b>delivery,</b> using microneedles coated with stabilized lipid nanocapsules, for delivery of a model vaccine formulation. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microneedle arrays were coated with multilayer films via layer-by-layer assembly of a biodegradable cationic poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE) and negatively charged interbilayer-cross-linked multilamellar lipid vesicles (ICMVs). To test the potential of these nanocapsule-coated microneedles for vaccine delivery, we loaded ICMVs with a protein antigen and the molecular adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A. Following application of microneedle arrays to the skin of mice for 5 min, (PBAE/ICMV) films were rapidly transferred from microneedle surfaces into the cutaneous tissue and remained in the skin following removal of the microneedle arrays. Multilayer films implanted in the skin dispersed ICMV cargos in the treated tissue {{over the course of}} 24 h in vivo, allowing for uptake of the lipid nanocapsules by antigen presenting cells in the local tissue and triggering their activation in situ. Microneedle-mediated transcutaneous vaccination with ICMV-carrying multilayers promoted robust antigen-specific humoral immune responses with a balanced generation of multiple IgG isotypes, whereas bolus delivery of soluble or vesicle-loaded antigen via intradermal injection or transcutaneous vaccination with microneedles encapsulating soluble protein elicited weak, IgG 1 -biased humoral immune responses. These results highlight the potential of lipid nanocapsules delivered by microneedles as a promising platform for noninvasive vaccine delivery applications.

40|$|<b>Transcutaneous</b> drug <b>delivery</b> from planar skin patches is {{effective}} for small-molecule drugs and skin-permeable vaccine adjuvants. However, to achieve efficient delivery of vaccines and other macromolecular therapeutics into the skin, {{penetration of the}} stratum corneum is needed. Topically applied skin patches with micron-scale projections ('microneedles') pierce the upper layers of the skin and enable vaccines that are coated on or encapsulated within the microneedles to be dispersed into the skin. Although millimeter-scale syringes have shown promise for vaccine delivery in humans and technologies, such as the Dermaroller (Dermaroller, Wolfenbüttel, Germany), exist for creating microscale punctures in the skin for delivery of solutions of therapeutics, solid microprojection microneedles coated with dry vaccine formulations offer a number of valuable features for vaccination, including reduced risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission or needle-stick injury, the potential for vaccine administration by minimally trained personnel or even self administration {{and the use of}} solid-state vaccine formulations that may reduce or eliminate cold-chain requirements in vaccine distribution. Recent studies in mice have demonstrated the ability of microneedles to effectively deliver vaccines to the skin, eliciting protective immunity to influenza, hepatitis C and West Nile virus.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{gene therapy}} is a {{promising}} new approach {{for a variety}} of diseases. As far as gene therapy aimed at the myocardium is concerned a new <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>delivery</b> method may be into the pericardial sac. Objective: To evaluate the safety and applicability of the percutaneous pericardial delivery route for drug- or gene-therapy. Methods: A percutaneous pericardial access device called a perducer(R) was used to deliver either Indian ink or methylene blue to the pericardium of male yorkshire pigs under hemodynamic surveillance. Animals were sacrificed after either 3 h or 3 days. Post mortem distribution of the injectate was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. Results: With the perducer(R), the pericardial cavity was punctured in 10 pigs without hemodynamic complications. Although traces of dye could be seen in the pleural cavity in pigs sacrificed after 3 h, no evidence for dissemination was found in myocardial, lung, mediastinal lymph node and liver tissue in pigs sacrificed after 3 days. In two additional pigs the pericardium was punctured with the same perducer(R) technique under simultaneous thoracoscopic monitoring. Visualization of the surface of the pericardium facilitated the procedure because pericardial fat could be avoided. Conclusion: Obtaining access to the pericardium with the perducer(R) technique is safe and feasible. In addition thoracoscopic guidance may improve success rate and offers the possibility of on line surveillance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Transcutaneous</b> <b>delivery</b> of {{vaccines}} {{to specific}} skin dendritic cells (DC) subsets is foreseen as a promising strategy to induce strong and {{specific types of}} immune responses such as tolerance, cytotoxicity or humoral immunity. Because of striking histological similarities between human and pig skin, pig is recognized as the most suitable model to study the cutaneous delivery of medicine. Therefore improving the knowledge on swine skin DC subsets would be highly valuable to the skin vaccine field. In this study, we showed that pig skin DC comprise the classical epidermal langerhans cells (LC) and dermal DC (DDC) that could be divided in 3 subsets according to their phenotypes: (1) the CD 163 (neg) /CD 172 a(neg), (2) the CD 163 (high) CD 172 a(pos) and (3) the CD 163 (low) CD 172 a(pos) DDC. These subtypes {{have the capacity to}} migrate from skin to lymph node since we detected them in pseudo-afferent lymph. Extensive phenotyping with a set of markers suggested that the CD 163 (high) DDC resemble the antibody response-inducing human skin DC/macrophages whereas the CD 163 (neg) CD 172 (low) DDC share properties with the CD 8 (+) T cell response-inducing murine skin CD 103 (pos) DC. This work, by showing similarities between human, mouse and swine skin DC, establishes pig as a model of choice for the development of transcutaneous immunisation strategies targeting DC...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of lipid synthesis inhibitors {{was used to}} enhance the in vitro and in vivo permeation of levodopa (LD) across rat epidermis, and their influence on epidermal lipids was investigated using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Rat epidermis was treated with ethanol and a {{combination of}} atorvastatin (750 μg/ 7 cm 2), cerulenin (20 μg/ 7 cm 2), and β-chloroalanine (600 μg/ 7 cm 2) for sustaining the reduced content of epidermal cholesterol, fatty acids (as triglycerides), and ceramide (as sphingosine), respectively, in viable rat skin. This treatment resulted in significant (P<. 05) synthesis inhibition of skin lipids up to 48 hours and 6 -fold enhancement in the in vitro permeation of LD. The effective plasma concentration of LD was achieved within 1 hour and maintained over 48 hours after topical application to rat epidermis treated {{with a combination of}} these lipid synthesis inhibitors. ATR-FTIR studies of inhibitor(s) -treated rat epidermis revealed a significant decrease (P<. 05) in peak height and area for both asymmetric and symmetric C−H stretching absorbances, suggesting extraction of lipids. However, an insignificant (P<. 05) shift in the frequency of these peaks suggested no fluidization of epidermal lipids by lipid synthesis inhibitors. A direct correlation was observed between epidermal lipid synthesis inhibition, decrease in peak height or area, and percutaneous permeation of LD. Skin lipid synthesis inhibition by a combination of lipid synthesis inhibitors seems to offer a feasible approach for enhancing the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>delivery</b> of LD...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of Review : To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the technologic advancements in the field of ablative therapy, focusing on the treatment of renal neoplasms. Materials and Methods : A MEDLINE search was performed using each specific ablative technique name as the search term. Articles written in the English language were selected for review. In cases of multiple reports by a single institution, the most recent report was utilized. Pertinent articles specific to the technologic advancement in ablative therapy were selected for review. Recent Findings : Intermediate-term oncologic outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation (CA) for the treatment of small renal masses are encouraging. For thermal therapies, molecular adjuvants to enhance cellular kill and local control have been developed. Improvements in microwave technology have allowed for reductions in antenna size and increases in ablation size. Laparoscopic high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) probes have been developed to overcome the limitations of <b>transcutaneous</b> energy <b>delivery,</b> but HIFU remains experimental for the treatment of renal lesions. Irreversible electroporation (IRE), a novel nonthermal ablative technique, is currently undergoing clinical investigation in human subjects. Histotripsy causes mechanical destruction of targeted tissue and shows promise in treating renal and prostate pathology. Summary : Ablative techniques are commonly utilized in the primary treatment of urologic malignancies. The purpose of this review is to discuss technologic advances in ablative therapies with emphasis on the treatment of renal masses. RFA and CA show acceptable intermediate-term efficacy and technical refinement continues. Emerging technologies, including microwave thermotherapy, IRE, HIFU and histotripsy, are described with emphasis on the mechanism of cellular kill, energy delivery, and stage in clinical development...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityThe {{quest for}} {{effective}} pain management during the birthing {{process is not}} a new phenomenon. Conventional methods have included analgesic and sedative drugs, epidural injections, and local blocks. A review of these methods and their potential risks and side effects are presented. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show the need for further research investigating transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as an alternative to conventional pain relief methods during labor and <b>delivery.</b> <b>Transcutaneous</b> Electrical Nerve Stimulation, based on the Gate Control Theory of Pain, may be a possible non-invasive, safe method of effective pain management. It has been used successfully for a variety of acute and chronic pain syndromes. Although good results have been reported in Europe, limited studies in the United States during the 70 's and 80 's were inconclusive as to the effectiveness for pain relief in laboring women. The use of TENS units for pain during the birthing process has an expansive potential of clinical significance and must be further explored through ongoing research...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines are {{sensitive}} biologics that require continuous refrigerated storage {{to maintain their}} viability. The vast majority of vaccines are also administered using needles and syringes. The need for cold chain storage and the significant logistics surrounding needle-and-syringe vaccination is constraining the success of immunization programs. Recombinant live viral vectors are a promising platform {{for the development of}} vaccines against a number of infectious diseases, however these viruses must retain infectivity to be effective. Microneedles offer an effective and painless method for delivery of vaccines directly into skin that in the future could provide solutions to current vaccination issues. Here we investigated methods of coating live recombinant adenovirus and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors onto solid microneedle arrays. An effective spray-coating method, using conventional pharmaceutical processes, was developed, in tandem with suitable sugar-based formulations, which produces arrays with a unique coating of viable virus in a dry form around the shaft of each microneedle on the array. Administration of live virus-coated microneedle arrays successfully resulted in virus <b>delivery,</b> <b>transcutaneous</b> infection and induced an antibody or CD 8 (+) T cell response in mice that was comparable to that obtained by needle-and-syringe intradermal immunization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful vaccination with recombinant live viral vectored vaccines coated on microneedle delivery devices...|$|R
