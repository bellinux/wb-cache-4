500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her at the train. [...] In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who [...] "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, [...] "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men...They all had to lie on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> {{and give me a}} passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die." [...] A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film A House Divided. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, [...] "What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?" ...|$|E

But they doubted my story for a long time, till at last one of them brought a crucifix that had somehow fallen into their hands, and held it up before me.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the modeling <b>of</b> magnetoelectric (<b>ME)</b> effects for disk-type Terfenol-D (Tb 0. 3 Dy 0. 7 Fe 1. 92) /PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3) laminate composite at low frequency {{by combining the}} advantages of the static elastic model and the equivalent circuit model, aiming at providing a guidance for the design and fabrication of the sensors based on magnetoelectric laminate composite. Considering that the strains of the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers are not equal in actual operating due to the epoxy resin adhesive bonding condition, the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers were first modeled through the equation of motion separately, and then coupled together with a new interface coupling factor kc, which physically reflects the strain transfer between the phases. Furthermore, a theoretical expression containing kc for the transverse ME voltage coefficient αv and the optimum thickness ratio noptim to which the maximum ME voltage coefficient corresponds were derived from the modified equivalent circuit <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> laminate, where the interface coupling factor acted as an ideal transformer. To explore the influence of mechanical load on the interface coupling factor kc, two sets of weights, i. e., 100 g and 500 g, were placed on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ME</b> laminates with the same thickness ratio n in the sample fabrication. A total of 22 T-T mode disk-type ME laminate samples with different configurations were fabricated. The interface coupling factors determined from the measured αv and the DC bias magnetic field Hbias were 0. 11 for 500 g pre-mechanical load and 0. 08 for 100 g pre-mechanical load. Furthermore, the measured optimum thickness ratios were 0. 61 for kc = 0. 11 and 0. 56 for kc = 0. 08. Both the theoretical ME voltage coefficient αv and optimum thickness ratio noptim containing kc agreed well with the measured data, verifying the reasonability and correctness for the introduction of kc in the modified equivalent circuit model...|$|R

40|$|In {{the quest}} to develop spintronic logic, it was {{discovered}} that magnetoelectric switching results in lower energy and shorter switching time than other mechanisms. Magnetoelectric (ME) field due to exchange bias at the interface with a multi-ferroic (such as BiFeO 3) is well suited for 180 degree switching <b>of</b> magnetization. The <b>ME</b> field is determined by the direction of canted magnetization in BiFeO 3 which can point at an angle to the plane, to which voltage is applied. Dependence of switching time and the threshold <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> field on its angles was determined by micromagnetic simulations. Switching occurs by formation of a domain wall {{on the side of the}} nanomagnet on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> BFO and its propagation to the rest of the magnet. For in-plane magnetization, switching occurs over a wide range of angles and at all magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> field above threshold. For out-of-plane magnetization failure occurs (with an exception of a narrow range of angles and magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> field) due to the domain wall reflecting from the opposite end of the nanomagnet.
