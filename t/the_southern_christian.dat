Ford {{attended}} Wayne State University and Grambling State University, from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations. He was expelled by the university, despite it being historically black, because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation. Ford {{was a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> Leadership Conference staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked for Martin Luther King, Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People's Campaign.

5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral {{authority}} and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests {{in the service of}} civil rights reform. One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.

25|$|New {{organizations}} such as <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) rose up with different approaches to activism.

50|$|Egypt and Makuria {{developed}} {{close and}} peaceful relations when Egypt was {{ruled by the}} Fatimids. The Shi'ite Fatimids had few allies in the Muslim world, and they turned to <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Christians</b> as allies. Fatimid power also depended upon the slaves provided by Makuria, who were used to man the Fatimid army. Trade between the two states flourished: Egypt sent wheat, wine, and linen south while Makuria exported ivory, cattle, ostrich feathers, and slaves. Relations with Egypt soured when the Ayyubids {{came to power in}} 1171. Early in the Ayyubid period the Nubians invaded Egypt, perhaps in support of their Fatimid allies. The Ayyubids repulsed their invasion and in response Salah ad-Din dispatched his brother Turan Shah to invade Nubia. He defeated the Nubians, and for several years occupied Qasr Ibrim before retreating north. The Ayyubids dispatched an emissary to Makuria {{to see if it was}} worth conquering, but he reported that the land was too poor. The Ayyubids seem to have thus largely ignored their <b>southern</b> neighbour for <b>the</b> next century.|$|R

25|$|The Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) was a {{civil rights}} {{organization}} in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, which coordinated boycotts and sponsored federal lawsuits aimed at dismantling segregation in Birmingham and Alabama during the Civil Rights Movement.

25|$|The 1963 {{march was}} an {{important}} part of the rapidly expanding Civil Rights Movement, which involved demonstrations and nonviolent direct action across the United States. 1963 also marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln.

25|$|The {{following}} year, Rustin and King began organizing <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> Leadership Conference (SCLC).

U.S. Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., {{who was a member}} of the SCLC's board, forced Rustin's resignation from the SCLC in 1960 by threatening to discuss Rustin's morals charge in Congress. Although Rustin was open about his sexual orientation and his conviction was a matter of public record, the events had not been discussed widely beyond the civil rights leadership.|$|E

50|$|The {{march was}} {{organized}} by A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Ella Baker. It {{was supported by the}} NAACP and <b>the</b> recently founded <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> Leadership Conference. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. had asked the planners not to embarrass the Eisenhower administration, thus the event was organized as a prayer commemoration.

40|$|Religious bigotry and {{misinterpretation}} {{to serve}} {{personal interest in}} our world today have given birth to incessant wars, lawless and reckless killings, genocides {{and the birth of}} dreadful terrorism. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the topic in question. The objectives of this paper are to examine: (a) the use of religion as a tool for political propaganda in the 2015 Presidential Election; (b) the reason why politicians make use of religion for propaganda; (c) the effects of using political propaganda. The study employed content, and descriptive analysis to synthesise data from newspapers, books and online works. Findings reveal that some key political parties made use of religion as a tool for political propaganda, at different ranges in print and electronic media. In effect, the use of religion by politicians was mainly due to the country’s regional divided front when it comes to religious beliefs; northern Muslims and <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Christians.</b> This abuse of religious rights breeds pathological hatred among the populace and {{there is a need to}} implement the tenets of secularism within the political framework to aid peace building...|$|R
