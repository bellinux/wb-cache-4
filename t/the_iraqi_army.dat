5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> had between 350,000 and 500,000 {{soldiers}} in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight Republican Guard divisions. Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment; for example, {{most of the}} estimated 1,000 T-72 tanks in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> {{on the eve of}} the war were in Republican Guard divisions. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the Republican Guard.|$|E

On 10 June, Mosul fell to ISIL, a devastating defeat given that there were 30,000 Iraqi troops in the city facing approximately 1,500 ISIL fighters.

50|$|Iraq's {{legislation}} on defence {{dates from the}} Coalition Provisional Authority period of 2003-2004. CPA Order 22 established <b>the</b> New <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> on August 18, 2003, and CPA Order 67 renamed <b>the</b> New <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Armed Forces on March 21, 2004. In the process, <b>the</b> New <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> was expanded to include an Army, Air Force, Coastal Defense Force, reserve forces, and other elements.|$|R
5|$|On 2 August 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> invaded and {{occupied}} the neighboring state of Kuwait. The invasion, which followed the inconclusive Iran–Iraq War and {{three decades of}} political conflict with Kuwait, offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait's oil resources to Iraq's own, a boon {{in a time of}} declining petroleum prices.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Marine Corps {{reconnaissance}} {{estimated that}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, {{in as many}} as 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.|$|E
5|$|Armored and {{mechanized}} divisions normally {{made use}} of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa. Given {{the size of the}} forces deployed across the border, it is thought that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{disbanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army,</b> insurgent activity increased, {{especially in}} Fallujah. Initially, armed resistance groups could {{be characterized as}} either Sunni nationalists who wanted {{to bring back the}} Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E

5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} {{knew that}} the Israeli army would sooner or later be stronger than his {{and that he had}} to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>army,</b> at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army,</b> and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army,</b> led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, {{the brigade}} was alerted {{that it could}} be {{deployed}} to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom {{by the end of the}} year. Four months later they were alerted that they would be heading to Iraq in 2008. The brigade mobilized in October of that year and trained in infantry techniques at army posts in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The 39th Infantry Brigade was also alerted for deployment during this time and deployed to Iraq in late 2007. During its rotation, the brigade was charged with turning over military facilities and Forward Operating Bases to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> as well as the Iraqi Police Force. The brigade returned to the United States in October 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1933, {{more than}} 600 Assyrians, led by Malik Yaqu, {{crossed the border}} into Syria in hope of {{receiving}} asylum from the French Mandate of Syria. They were, however, disarmed and refused asylum, and were subsequently given light arms and sent back to Iraq on 4 August. They then decided to surrender themselves to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army.</b> While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun, a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an Iraqi Army brigade. Despite the advantage of heavy artillery, the Iraqis were driven back to their military base in Dirabun. The Assyrians, convinced that the army had targeted them deliberately, attacked an army barracks with little success. They were driven back to Syria upon the arrival of Iraqi aeroplanes. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> lost 33 soldiers during the fighting while the Assyrian irregulars took fewer casualties. Historians do not agree on who started the clashes at the border. The British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Stafford, wrote that the Assyrians {{had no intention of}} clashing with the Iraqis, while the Iraqi historian Khaldun Husry (son of the prominent Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri) claims that it was Yaqu's men who provoked the army at Dirabun. Husry supported the propaganda rumours, which circulated in the Iraqi nationalist newspapers, of the Assyrians mutilating the bodies of the killed Iraqi soldiers. This further enraged the Iraqi public against the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} in Kirkuk received {{large numbers of}} patients with symptoms that doctors recognised from the 1960 outbreak. The first case of alkylmercury poisoning was admitted to hospital on 21 December. By 26 December, the hospital had issued a specific warning to the government. By January 1972, the government had started to strongly warn the populace about eating the grain, although dispatches {{did not mention the}} large numbers already ill. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> soon ordered disposal of the grain and eventually declared the death penalty for anyone found selling it. Farmers dumped their supplies wherever possible, and it soon got into the water supply (particularly the River Tigris), causing further problems. The government issued a news blackout and released little information about the outbreak.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army.</b> On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July, insurgents {{launched}} {{an assault on}} Camp Speicher, where an estimated 700 government soldiers and 150 Iranian or Iraqi Shiite militiamen were besieged following the failed attempt to send reinforcements to the air base. The assault included snipers and suicide bombers and the militants quickly managed to reach the runway, at which point Iraqi special forces joined the battle. The base was bombarded and mortared all night. By the next morning, according to various sources, the final pocket of government troops had collapsed, {{with all of the}} government forces either killed, executed or captured. At least 25–35 insurgents were also killed. Iraqi forces attempted to save the base's aircraft by flying them out, but according to ISIL 8–9 helicopters were destroyed on the ground or shot down, with several armored vehicles destroyed as well. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> denied the alleged capture of the base with soldiers from the front line reporting that Speicher was still under their control, with only three soldiers being killed, one helicopter destroyed and two damaged. A Tikrit resident also reported continued fighting around the base. Two days later, the military reported that Iraqi special forces had re-secured the base.|$|E
5|$|The brigade again {{deployed}} to Iraq for the OIF 07-09 rotation. This time, the brigade was headquartered in Balad, Iraq. The brigade was given Husky Mine Detection vehicles and Buffalo mine protected carrier vehicles for the deployment. The brigade {{was responsible for}} providing combat, geospatial and general engineering and reconstruction operations in partnership with Provincial Reconstruction Teams, Civil Service Corps, Sons of Iraq and Iraqi Army engineers, as well as training and assisting <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> and provincial engineers in the rebuilding of the infrastructure of Iraq. As of May 2008, the brigade had constructed 10 major bridges and destroyed or captured IED cells in nine of the country's provinces. During the deployment it was visited by Lieutenant General Lloyd J. Austin III, the commanding general of Multi-National Corps Iraq. The brigade was scheduled to return to Fort Bragg {{in the fall of}} 2008, to be replaced by the 555th Engineer Brigade. This was completed during a transfer of authority ceremony on 29 September 2008. The brigade then began redeploying to Fort Bragg, completing its return by November 2008. A year later, in August 2009, the brigade held a ceremony promoting dozens of its soldiers to the rank of Sergeant.|$|E
