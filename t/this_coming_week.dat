50|$|More evident is the {{philosophical}} underpinning that the books' author, Henning Mankell, brings, focusing {{down on the}} forensic work of a provincial detective the global sins of the western world. <b>This</b> <b>coming</b> <b>week’s</b> episode, The Brothers, is a murder mystery emerging from a terrible crime perpetrated {{by a group of}} drunken men on colonised people; last week's, The Village Idiot, had at its core the moral obloquy of a private surgeon greedy for profit.Wallander and his comrades seek what remedies they can to the consequences of the sins of oppression and greed. At one point, Wallander tells his daughter, Linda, who is applying to become a detective, that she should reflect—otherwise she, like him, will emerge from a tunnel 30 years later, wondering what had happened to life. What had happened for Wallander is a melancholy immersion in human degradation, a provincial Inferno without a Virgil to guide him.|$|R

Bryant College Service Club 1 Young Orchard Ave. Providence Rhode Island Dear Bryant Service Club: I {{received}} {{your very}} newsy letter just {{after returning from}} a most enjoyable eight day furlough which I spend in the beautiful city of Edinburgh. Just a year ago <b>this</b> <b>coming</b> <b>week</b> I arrived here in England and I have enjoyed my stay very much, however, naturally I prefer being back in the states. In your letter you mentioned several boys who were giving there best for their country- {{one of whom was}} my buddy through Bryant- Joe Buerdsell – I have contacted his mother {{as well as a number}} of his intimate friends. For sometime I had hopes that he may have been picked up but now, I guess, he must be presumed lost. My work is quite interesting and have been extremely fortunate in being placed here when I look over some of the other fields where I could have been landed. Paper seems to be running short so must close – hoping to hear from you again. As ever Bill [Transcription ends...|$|E

60|$|No, my dear friends, let us rather, in <b>this</b> <b>coming</b> Passion <b>week,</b> {{take the}} lesson which the {{services}} of the Church give us in this Epistle. Let us keep Passion week really and in spirit, by remembering that it means the week of suffering, in which Christ, instead of pleasing himself, conquered himself, and gave up himself, and let wicked men do with him whatsoever they would. Let us honour the holy name of Jesus in spirit and in truth, and bend not merely our necks or our knees, when we hear his name, but bend those stiff necks of our souls, and those stubborn knees of our hearts; let us conquer our self-will, self-opinion, self-conceit, self-interest, and take his yoke upon us, for he is meek and lowly of heart. This is the Passion week which he has chosen;--to distrust ourselves, and our own opinions, likings and fancies. This is the repentance, {{and this is the}} humiliation which he has chosen;--to entreat him (now and at once, lest by pride we give place to the devil, and fall while we think we stand) to forgive us every hard, and proud, and conceited, and self-willed thought, and word, and deed, to which we have given way since we were born; to pray to him for really new hearts, really tender hearts, really humble hearts, really broken and contrite hearts; to look at his beautiful tenderness, patience, sympathy, understanding, generosity, self-sacrifice; and then to look at ourselves, and be shocked, and ashamed, and confounded, at the difference between ourselves and him; and so really to honour the name of Jesus, who humbled himself, even to the death upon the cross.|$|R
