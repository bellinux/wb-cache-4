40|$|Both {{academics}} and practitioners don’t seem to {{pay too much}} attention to the databases of zero-coupon rates that they employ in their research and the implementation of models for valuation or risk measuring purposes. We show that significant differences may arise when using alternative popular and usually accepted interest rates databases. In particular, we show that these differences are relevant when calibrating well known interest rates models (Vasicek and Cox,Ingersoll and Ross) and also when valuing some insurance contracts such as <b>temporary</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We study {{indifference}} pricing {{of mortality}} contingent claims in a fully stochastic model. We assume both stochastic {{interest rates and}} stochastic hazard rates governing the population mortality. In this setting we compute the indifference price charged by an insurer that uses exponential utility and sells k contingent claims to k independent but homogeneous individuals. Throughout {{we focus on the}} examples of pure endowments and <b>temporary</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuities.</b> We begin with a continuous-time model where we derive the linear pdes satisfied by the indifference prices and carry out extensive comparative statics. In particular, we show that the price-per-risk grows as more contracts are sold. We then also provide a more flexible discrete-time analogue that permits general hazard rate dynamics. In the latter case we construct a simulation-based algorithm for pricing general mortality-contingent claims and illustrate with a numerical example...|$|R
40|$|We address <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> and pensions, {{looking in}} {{particular}} at transfers/sharing of biometric risks, i. e. risks {{related to the}} annuitant’s lifetime and health status, involved by the policy conditions or the pension plan rules.

50|$|In 1671 De Witt {{conceived}} of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as a weighted average of annuities certain where the weights were mortality probabilities (that sum to one), thereby producing the expected {{value of the}} present value of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Edmond Halley’s (of comet fame) representation of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> dates to 1693, when he re-expressed a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as the discounted value of each annual payment multiplied by the probability of surviving long enough to receive the payment and summed until there are no survivors. De Witt's approach was especially insightful and ahead of its time. In modern terminology, De Witt treats a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> as a random variable and its expected value is what we call the value of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Also in modern terminology, De Witt's approach allows one to readily understand other properties of this random variable such as its standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, or any other characteristic of interest.|$|R
40|$|Oregon Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) retirees {{must choose}} between {{receiving}} {{all of their}} retirement benefits as <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments and receiving lower <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments coupled with a partial lump sum payout. For the median retiree, the expected present value of the incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments is 1. 50 times the lump sum payout, and demand for lump sums is low. This pattern is consistent with value-maximizing decisions by retirees. However, when we exploit variation {{in the value of}} the incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments arising from how PERS calculates retirement benefits, we find robust evidence that demand for lump sum payouts is higher when the forgone <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments are more valuable. We also find that demand for lump sum payouts is higher when the lump sum payout is “large, ” and when equity market returns over the prior 12 months are higher. Collectively, these findings suggest that retirees value incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments at less than their expected present value, either because they do not know how to accurately value <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> or because they have strong demand for large lump sum payouts. In contrast, when we measure variation {{in the value of the}} incremental <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments along a dimension that is easier for retirees to observe and interpret—poor health at retirement—we find evidence consistent with value-maximizing decision-making...|$|R

40|$|This article compares wealth {{management}} strategies for individuals in retirement, focusing on trade-offs regarding wealth creation and income security.

40|$|Economists {{have long}} been puzzled by the low demand for <b>life</b> <b>annuities.</b> To shed new light on this puzzle, we study payout choices in the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System, where each retiree must choose between a lump sum and a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Notably, the average <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> we study is better than actuarially fair when {{compared}} to the lump sum and 85 % of retirees choose the <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Whether and how retirees respond to variation in the value of <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> payments depends crucially on the source of variation. We find strong evidence that demand responds to variation in retiree characteristics. In contrast, we find little evidence that demand responds to plausibly exogenous variation in annuity pricing, which is economically meaningful but less salient. Finally, we find robust evidence that demand for the lump sum increases with recent equity market returns and other salient measures of investor sentiment. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two kinds}} of annuity, <b>annuity</b> certain and <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> Annuity certain does not depend on life probability, for example, mortgage. <b>Life</b> <b>annuity</b> depends on time until death and life probability, for example, pension payment from {{insurance}} company. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss further about <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> and the relationship with life probability that is influences by time until death and the assumption of interest which is used. Time until death (T) is a random variable, because it is unpredictable. To determine the value of distribution, assumption values on tqx will be used.

40|$|We {{find the}} minimum {{probability}} of lifetime ruin of an investor who can {{invest in a}} market with a risky and a riskless asset and who can purchase a reversible <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> The surrender charge of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> is a proportion of its value. Ruin occurs when the total {{of the value of}} the risky and riskless assets and the surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> reaches zero. We find the optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender strategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is allowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> keeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets is required to be non-negative. In the first case, although the individual has the flexiblity to buy or sell at any time, we find that the individual will not buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and she will never sell her annuity. In the second case, the individual surrenders just enough annuity income to keep her total assets positive. However, in this second case, the individual’s annuity purchasing strategy depends on the size of the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the individual will not buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> unless she can cover all her consumption, the so-called safe level. When the charge is small enough, the individual will buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> at a wealth lower than this safe level.

40|$|For many years, the {{longevity}} risk of individuals has been underestimated, as survival probabilities have improved across the developed world. The uncertainty and volatility of future longevity has posed significant risk issues for both individuals and product providers of annuities and pensions. This paper investigates {{the effectiveness of}} static hedging strategies for longevity risk management using longevity bonds and derivatives (q-forwards) for the retail products: <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> deferred <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> indexed <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> and variable annuity with guaranteed lifetime benefits. Improved market and mortality models are developed for the underlying risks in annuities. The market model is a regime-switching vector error correction model for GDP, inflation, interest rates, and share prices. The mortality model is a discrete-time logit model for mortality rates with age dependence. Models were estimated using Australian data. The basis risk between annuitant portfolios and population mortality was based on UK experience. Results show that static hedging using q-forwards or longevity bonds reduces {{the longevity}} risk substantially for <b>life</b> <b>annuities,</b> but significantly less for deferred annuities. For inflation-indexed annuities, static hedging of longevity is less effective because of the inflation risk. Variable annuities provide limited longevity protection compared to <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> and indexed annuities, {{and as a result}} longevity risk hedging adds little value for these products.

40|$|Mortality improvements, {{uncertainty}} in future mortality trends and the relevant impact on <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> and pension plans constitute important topics {{in the field}} of actuarial mathematics and life insurance techniques. In particular, actuarial calculations concerning pensions, <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> and other living benefits (provided, for example, by long-term care insurance products and whole life sickness covers) are based on survival probabilities which necessarily extend over a long time horizon. In order to avoid underestimation of the related liabilities, the insurance company (or the pension plan) must adopt an appropriate forecast of future mortality. Great attention is currently being devoted to the management of <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> portfolios, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, because of the growing importance of annuity benefits paid by private pension schemes. In particular, the progressive shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension schemes has increased the interest in <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> with a guaranteed annual amount.
