5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E

5|$|The outer Adams ring, with an orbital {{radius of}} about 63,930km, {{is the best}} studied of Neptune's rings. It is named after John Couch Adams, who {{predicted}} the position of Neptune independently of Le Verrier. This ring is narrow, slightly eccentric and inclined, with total width of about 35km (15–50km), and its normal optical depth is around 0.011±0.003 outside the arcs, which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4km. The fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40%—lower than in other narrow rings. Neptune's small moon Galatea, which orbits just inside of <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring at 61,953km, acts like a shepherd, keeping ring particles inside a narrow range of orbital radii through a 42:43 outer Lindblad resonance. Galatea's gravitational influence creates 42 radial wiggles in <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring with an amplitude of about 30km, which {{have been used to}} infer Galatea's mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune {{are made of}} {{extremely}} dark material, likely organic compounds processed by radiation, similar to that found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.|$|E

5|$|The arcs in <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring remain unexplained. Their {{existence}} is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply {{that they should}} spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several theories about the arcs' confinement have been suggested, the most widely publicized of which holds that Galatea confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring's orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings' mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led {{to the conclusion that}} the rings are not in CIR with Galatea.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} and longest arc was Fraternité; {{the faintest}} was Courage. The normal optical {{depths of the}} arcs are estimated to lie in the range 0.03–0.09 (0.034±0.005 for {{the leading edge of}} Liberté arc as measured by stellar occultation); the radial widths are approximately the same as those of the continuous ring—about 30km. The equivalent depths of arcs vary in the range 1.25–2.15km (0.77±0.13km for the leading edge of Liberté arc). The fraction of dust in the arcs is from 40% to 70%. The arcs in <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring are somewhat similar to the arc in Saturn's G ring.|$|E
5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.|$|E

5|$|The rings were {{investigated}} in detail during the Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Neptune in August 1989. They were studied with optical imaging, and through observations of occultations in ultraviolet and visible light. The spaceprobe observed the rings in different geometries {{relative to the}} Sun, producing images of back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the phase function (dependence of the ring's reflectivity on the angle between the observer and Sun), and geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of six inner moons of Neptune, including <b>the</b> <b>Adams</b> ring shepherd Galatea.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, New Hampshire was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill {{laying the groundwork for}} a party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National Republicans), who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached.

Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams {{in an effort to make}} him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. <b>The</b> <b>Adams</b> cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E
