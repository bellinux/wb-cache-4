5|$|Stanley's murals were {{discussed}} in the British Parliament in October 1968. Charles Morris, minister of parliament for Openshaw, asked the Defence Ministry, Denis Healy, to consider moving <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> to England. His proposal was unsuccessful when the Singapore Ministry of Defence decided to take responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> and {{to keep them in}} good condition for display in 1969. (Singapore gained independence from Britain in August 1965). In addition, a copy of one of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> painted by Stanley had been brought to England and installed in the Garrison Church at Larkhill in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>murals</b> {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> bear scriptures in Greek. <b>The</b> <b>murals</b> were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on <b>the</b> <b>murals.</b> A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, turning on the right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. <b>The</b> <b>murals</b> on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the walls}} of the chapel were distempered over, hiding <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> from view. They were {{forgotten}} until its rediscovery in 1958. Due to their historical significance, an international search was conducted to locate the original painter in helping to restore the damaged and faded murals. Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. He made three trips to Singapore between 1963 and 1988 to restore his former paintings. Due to Stanley's advanced age, only four of the original murals were fully restored. In the 1990s, the former site of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> was gazetted as a Heritage Site by the National Heritage Board of Singapore.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{proscenium}} <b>mural</b> of <b>the</b> theatre {{displays a}} stunning 3-piece canvas painting by artist William Hasenberg. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> was painted during the finishing stages of construction in 1927 {{to complete the}} theatre's grand scale look. During a renovation in 1973, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> and surrounding ceiling was painted with dark blue and white paint. The repainting was thought to have destroyed <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> until restoration efforts by muralist David Strickland proved successful in removing the blue and white paint without destroying <b>the</b> underlying <b>mural.</b> <b>The</b> 1994 restoration project restored <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> to its original look. <b>The</b> <b>mural,</b> now perfectly restored, catches the eye of every guest who steps into the auditorium.|$|R
50|$|Over time, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> has {{degraded}} from weathering. Alicia {{has tried}} {{several times to}} raise money to restore <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> although she would prefer to do a permanent mosaic based on <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> in its place.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mural</b> was an {{initiative}} {{headed by the}} Armed Forces of the Philippines, Metro Manila Development Authority, Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, Asia America Initiative, and Dolphins Love Freedom Network. The painting of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> was commenced on March 26, 2013 by more than 1,000 individuals planning to make a 4 kilometer mural. On July 27, 2013 <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> was inaugurated. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> measured 3,770 meters on its completion. The main theme of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> is <b>the</b> concept of Bayanihan {{as a vehicle for}} peace in the country.|$|R
5|$|In 1903 {{the artist}} Ford Madox Brown was {{commissioned}} to produce <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> known as The Manchester Murals for Manchester Town Hall. The painting entitled Crabtree watching the transit of Venus AD 1639 is a romanticised depiction of Crabtree's {{observation of the}} event.|$|E
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature on any of <b>the</b> <b>murals,</b> {{a search for the}} artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 and 1934, Stackpole {{took part}} in the Public Works of Art Project {{assignment}} to paint murals for Coit Tower. Many of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> were executed in styles reminiscent of Rivera, and Stackpole himself was portrayed in five of them; in one he is shown reading a newspaper announcing the destruction of a Rivera mural in New York.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mural</b> {{has since}} been {{disassembled}} following the close of Alexander's and the Bergen Museum of Art & Science's purchase of <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> While various suggestions to the non-profit organization concerning its potential location have amassed, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> was only recently put on display in Paterson, New Jersey at the Art Factory in June, 2015. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> has yet to find a replacement for its location of display.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>mural's</b> {{image of}} Jesus, visible from Notre Dame's {{football}} stadium, has arms {{raised in the}} same fashion as a referee signifying a touchdown. From this similarity came <b>the</b> <b>mural's</b> nickname, [...] "Touchdown Jesus". A stadium expansion partially obscures views of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> from <b>the</b> field.|$|R
5000|$|By 2008 no deal {{to remove}} the fresco from the {{building}} had been finalized due {{to the cost of}} removing <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> M.D. Anderson stated that it would give away <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> located in <b>the</b> building's lobby, for no charge. Allan Turner of the Houston Chronicle said that removing <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> restoring it, and installing it in a new location would cost over $500,000. Peter Marzio, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, said that the museum was approached about possibly accepting <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> Marzio said that the museum rejected the fresco because it was too [...] "site specific." [...] In 2010 a benefactor from Artesia, New Mexico agreed to have <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> removed. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> will {{become a part of the}} public library of Artesia.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{two of the}} {{original}} columns were resited at Northwest 10th Avenue between Everett and Flanders Streets. The Regional Arts & Culture Council was searching for photographs showing <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> in their original location for an ongoing restoration project. In 2006, Randy Shelton reconstructed the artworks on the columns using the photographs for reference.|$|E
5|$|Some modern murals on {{the line}} include an homage to the 1996 Argentine film Moebius at San José station. The film used the line as its primary filming {{locations}} and <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> depict scenes from it. The soon to be opened Correo Central station has received an award from the Association of Structural Engineers in Argentina for the quality and creativity of the work.|$|E
5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} church are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard compositional model which had been established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the captions which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, though a few are in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E
50|$|This {{subject of}} <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> <b>the</b> University's main building, is further down Ülikooli Street {{and it is}} {{possible}} to view both <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> and <b>the</b> main building at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mural,</b> {{which was}} created using acrylic paint, depicts {{children}} at play on a hill as seen {{through a series of}} white arched doorways or windows. A fire in 1975 destroyed a building that used to be adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> site; according to the label near the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> [...] "The three-tiered design of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> was inspired by the architectural structure of the building that burned, and is a whimsical study of color and motion." ...|$|R
50|$|Artist Ted Watts {{completed}} <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> in December 1998 and {{has updated}} <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> to include recent accomplishments in 2002, 2005 and 2009.|$|R
5|$|Dilys Cadwaladr, {{the former}} school teacher on Bardsey Island, in 1953 {{became the first}} woman to win the Crown at the National Eisteddfod for her long poem Y Llen; and artist Brenda Chamberlain twice won the Gold Medal for Art at the Eisteddfod; some of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> she painted can still be seen on the walls of Carreg, her island home from 1947 to 1962. Wildlife artist Kim Atkinson, whose work has been widely {{exhibited}} in Wales and England, spent her childhood on the island and returned to live there in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Preckwinkle {{decided to}} paint over two 36-year-old, unmaintained and {{severely}} damaged public murals in the 47th Street Metra underpass. <b>The</b> <b>murals</b> {{had been created}} by graffiti artists, working with permission from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, and had represented themes that included Latin-American, African, Mayan, Indian, and Native American spiritual practices. The walls were later covered with newly commissioned murals: one {{is made up of}} a series of ceramic tiles and the other is a traditional painted mural featuring the city and important historical South Side figures, including former Alderman Dorothy Tillman.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} <b>the</b> <b>mural's</b> completion, New Seasons Market {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new store immediately adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> In January 2014, the co-owner of Red Fox Vintage, said, [...] "We're going to have a sit-down with New Seasons about <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> To <b>the</b> best of my knowledge, New Seasons will make it right." [...] She shared three options to discuss with the company: repainting <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> on Red Fox's east wall, transferring it to the new store's exterior wall, or keeping <b>the</b> original <b>mural</b> in place and making it visible from the grocery store's interior.|$|R
50|$|In 1995 the University Center Policy Board {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> {{as part of an}} effort to change the theme of the University Center. Hispanic Student Association President Russell Contreras spearheaded efforts to encourage Chicano students to attend a policy board meeting in favor of preserving <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> He mentions that these were not the first efforts to have <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> removed. A coalition of students wrote a letter to the editor of the campus newspaper, the Daily Cougar. Many administrators were in favor of moving <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> which is painted on a scroll and attached to the wall. In the end, student protests prevailed and <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> was not moved.|$|R
50|$|Shawnee Mission Northwest High School was {{established}} in 1969 to help educate the increasing populations of Shawnee and Overland Park, Kansas. In 1998, a mural of evolution was painted near the science rooms in the school which created controversy throughout the school and <b>the</b> city. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> depicted many things including DNA, cells, photosynthesis, and a four chambered heart. In addition to this, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> also depicted {{in a series of}} walking figures, the evolution of man, from a hunched-over, hairy, apelike creature to the modern man. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> offended many students and their parents and a large debate was held concerning whether to paint over <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> was left alone and remains today.|$|R
5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} {{have been}} mapped at Iximche. The structures {{were faced with}} stone blocks that were coated in lime plaster, which in some cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.|$|E
5|$|The three-storey Block 151 of Roberts Barracks (off Martlesham Road) {{still stands}} today, {{but is now}} part of the Ministry of Defence's Changi Airbase Camp. Most of the {{buildings}} surrounding Block 151 were demolished in July 2003. Inside the Chapel, there is a photo of Stanley and some narrative about him and <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> but access to the Chapel is restricted. However, for public interest, a replica of Stanley Warren's murals is also on display at the Changi Chapel and Museum, along with an audio-visual theatre that screens videos about POW life, display of POW belongings and collection of books about Singapore during WWII.|$|E
5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} invention of the weeding rake. The invention of the Chinese weed rake is derived from the invention of the Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth rakes due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, Y-shaped rake, and square rake. The harrows seen in <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip rakes.|$|E
40|$|Black {{and white}} {{photograph}} of mural {{of young people}} in an alley way, the Mission District, 2 p. m., San Francisco, California, September 16 2002. A young man and woman are depicted jumping to the left of <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> and another youth is on the right of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> with his arms outspread. The title of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> is on <b>the</b> bottom: "When Doves Cry". There are keys attached to a looping strand of barbed wire, and this motif makes up the background of <b>the</b> <b>mural...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{defining}} {{factor in}} the preservation of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> over <b>the</b> centuries is <b>the</b> <b>mural's</b> situation in a dark, cramped space behind the historic reredos. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> is situated on a wall about two feet behind the reredos. It is only partially visible from an oblique angle through a trap door that opens from the attic above.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mural</b> depicts John Brown in {{the prelude}} to the Civil War, during the {{bleeding}} Kansas unrest. A study for <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> is in <b>the</b> Spencer Museum.|$|R
5|$|Medieval frescoes used {{to cover}} the {{entirety}} of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with oil paint in the 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places the painting of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova believe they were created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, the mural inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018–1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv).|$|E
5|$|The church's {{interior}} has preserved {{a number}} of medieval frescoes, particularly in the lower reaches of the walls and pillars. The paintings in the altar were done in the 11th–12th century, while the decoration of the pillars dates to the 12th century. All inscriptions that accompany <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> are in Medieval Greek. The altar features the images of four deacons bearing a censer and monstrances {{as well as two}} bishops who could possibly be identified as Basil of Caesarea and John Chrysostom. A number of saints are also depicted inside the church, including Saint Elijah, Saints Cosmas and Damian, Saint Hermolaus, Saint Pantaleon, and four unidentified female saints. There are also later works of art in the church. It boasts icons or murals by painter Ivan Dospevski from 1881 as well as works by Mihail Belstoynev.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Prometheus was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a Fazioli piano. The ship's garage {{was built on the}} backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the {{interior of}} a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression. Giger designed <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> that appear within the chamber.|$|E
50|$|Fruits of the Fifth Ward, a mural {{depicting}} 21 notable {{individuals who}} are natives of the Fifth Ward or have connections to the Fifth Ward, was created by Wheatley High School students. Reginald Adams, {{the executive director of}} the Museum of Cultural Arts Houston (MOCAH), oversaw the creation of <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> <b>The</b> project began after the History Channel gave MOCAH a $10,000 grant to create a <b>mural</b> depicting <b>the</b> history of the Fifth Ward. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> was constructed from February 15 to October 21, 2006. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> was dedicated on Saturday October 21, 2006. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> is adjacent to Crawford Elementary School.|$|R
50|$|In June 2015, {{pieces of}} <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> {{were put on}} display at the Art Factory in Paterson, New Jersey. The hope was to have <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> {{completely}} reassembled for the exhibition, which was attended by George and Ruth Farkas' granddaughter Cindy Glanzrock among others. However, twenty pieces of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> remained in their storage facility in Carlstadt as Roseman would not allow the Art Factory's owner, David Garsia, to display them as he did not trust his intentions. As such, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> was laid out in rows, with some having specific themes.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{areas of}} <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> have {{deteriorated}} over time, particularly a section {{at the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> that has been severely abraded, possibly when an electrical cable was installed in front of <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> Besides being an engaging piece of art, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> is an intriguing artifact from a seemingly remote past. An artifact which silently stood witness for five years as a few missionaries on the frontier edge of an extended empire endeavored to convert the numerous native peoples to Catholicism and a Spanish colonial vision of civilization.|$|R
