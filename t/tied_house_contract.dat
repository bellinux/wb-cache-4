50|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, saloons (both Western {{and in the}} eastern cities) in the United States were often <b>tied</b> <b>houses,</b> with breweries having {{exclusive}} contracts with drinking establishments and often helping prospective saloon keepers get their start in business. Competition between saloons was fierce, especially as many areas had several saloons, each tied to a different brewery; the breweries often ran aggressive marketing campaigns through their <b>tied</b> <b>houses</b> to increase demand and increase their market share. This system ended with the enactment of nationwide Prohibition in the United States in 1919.|$|R

Production of Melbourne beer immediately ceased, although Tetley Mild was brewed at the Melbourne brewery until 1962. Tetley relied {{on the quality of}} its beer to drive sales in the free trade.|$|R
40|$|Using {{the case}} of the Contract Buyers League and the {{prevalence}} of colonias, where many homes are purchased on contract, this Article analyzes installment <b>housing</b> <b>contracts</b> with regard to the common law defense of unconscionability. Not only do the circumstances leading to such contracts, the terms of the contract, and the effects on buyers of the contract often meet the doctrinal definition of unconscionability, but these contracts are also implicated in racial-ethnic inequality. This Article thus argues that courts should view installment <b>housing</b> <b>contracts</b> as presumptively unconscionable...|$|R

5000|$|The pub {{itself may}} {{be owned by}} the brewery or pub company in question, with the publican renting the pub from the brewery or pub company, termed a tenancy. Alternatively, the brewery may appoint a {{salaried}} manager while retaining ownership of the pub; that arrangement is a [...] "managed house". Finally, a publican may finance {{the purchase of a}} pub with soft loans (usually a mortgage) from a brewer and be required to buy his beer from it in return. The traditional advantage of <b>tied</b> <b>houses</b> for breweries was the steadiness of demand they gave them; a <b>tied</b> <b>house</b> would not change its beer supplier suddenly so the brewer had a consistent market for its beer production.|$|R
