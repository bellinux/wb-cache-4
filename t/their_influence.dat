5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing <b>their</b> <b>influence</b> in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. <b>Their</b> <b>influence</b> reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E
5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, <b>their</b> <b>influence</b> and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|By July 1808, Breckinridge {{had decided}} to return to Princeton in October to finish his studies. His roommate, James G. Birney, and the {{university}} president, Samuel Stanhope Smith, were both ardent abolitionists, and through <b>their</b> <b>influence,</b> he became convinced that slavery must be ended, but only by voluntary emancipation, not by government interference. He completed his bachelor's degree in 1810.|$|E

5|$|In Valparaíso, {{they created}} their {{largest and most}} {{important}} colony, bringing with them neighbourhoods of British character, schools, social clubs, sports clubs, business organisations and periodicals.

5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} lost <b>their</b> <b>influence</b> as {{the rulers}} passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E

At the time of the Conquest the land was held by Dreng, which is a Nordic name.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance trends from Italy and Central Europe {{influenced}} Russia in many ways. <b>Their</b> <b>influence</b> {{was rather}} limited, however, {{due to the}} large distances between Russia and the main European cultural centers and the strong adherence of Russians to their Orthodox traditions and Byzantine legacy.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a subgenre of role-playing video games that are characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player-character.

5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416–415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos {{on one side and}} Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined <b>their</b> <b>influence</b> to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.|$|E
5|$|The French {{had built}} nearby Logstown as a trade and council {{center for the}} Native Americans to {{increase}} <b>their</b> <b>influence</b> in the Ohio Valley. Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region. De Bienville warned away English traders and posted markers claiming the territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of infinitesimal calculus {{was at the}} forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to <b>their</b> <b>influence,</b> studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.|$|E

5|$|While the {{controversy}} raged, American Presbyterians were also concerned with expanding <b>their</b> <b>influence.</b> In 1740, a New York Board of the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was established. Four years later, David Brainerd was assigned as a missionary to the Native Americans. New Side Presbyterians {{were responsible for}} founding Princeton University (originally the College of New Jersey) primarily to train ministers in 1746.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge <b>their</b> <b>influence</b> over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the dictatorship {{that allowed him}} to regulate the level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep them up to the inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand <b>their</b> <b>influence.</b> There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E
