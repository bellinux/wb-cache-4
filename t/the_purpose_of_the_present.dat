Yet since it is allowed on both sides that such assumptions are often made improperly, we may find it practicable, without entering into the ultimate metaphysical grounds of the discussion, to state some speculative propositions, and suggest some practical cautions, respecting the forms in which such unwarranted assumptions {{are most likely to}} be made.|$|E

60|$|For {{these reasons}} we propose (merely for <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> work) to define {{religion}} as {{the belief in}} a primal being, a Maker, undying, usually moral, without denying that the belief in spiritual beings, even if immoral, may be styled religious. Our definition is expressly framed {{for the purpose of}} the argument, because that argument endeavours to bring into view the essential conflict between religion and myth. We intend to show that this conflict between the religious and the mythical conception is present, not only (where it has been universally recognised) in the faiths of the ancient civilised peoples, as in Greece, Rome, India and Egypt, but also in the ideas of the lowest known savages.|$|E
60|$|To {{those who}} have been kind enough to {{communicate}} books and manuscripts for <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> publication, the Editor and, through him, Mr. Coleridge's executor return their grateful thanks. In most cases a specific acknowledgement has been made. But, above and independently of all others, it is to Mr. and Mrs. Gillman, and to Mr. Green himself, that the public are indebted for the preservation and use of the principal part of the contents of these volumes. The claims of those respected individuals on the gratitude of the friends and admirers of Coleridge and his works are already well known, and in due season those claims will receive additional confirmation.|$|E
60|$|For <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> inquiry I also omit all {{the rites}} of leaping sportfully, and of driving cattle through light fires. Of these cases, from the Roman Palilia, or Parilia, downwards, {{there is a}} useful {{collection}} in Brand's Popular Antiquities under the heading 'Midsummer Eve.' One exception must be made for a passage from Torreblanca's Demonologia (p. 106). People are said 'pyras circumire et transilire in futuri mali averruncatione'--to 'go round about and leap over lighted pyres {{for the purpose of}} averting future evils,' as in Mannhardt's theory of the Hirpi. This may be connected with the Bulgarian rite, to be described later, but, as a rule, in all these instances, the fire is a light one of straw, and no sort of immunity is claimed by the people who do not walk through, but leap across it.|$|E

60|$|It is in {{this spirit}} that the {{following}} collection of Mrs. Browning's letters has now been prepared, in {{the conviction that the}} lovers of English literature will be glad to make a closer and more intimate acquaintance with one--or, it may truthfully be said, with two--of the most interesting literary characters of the Victorian age. It is a selection from a large mass of letters, written at all periods in Mrs. Browning's life, which Mr. Browning, after his wife's death, reclaimed from the friends to whom they had been written, or from their representatives. No doubt, Mr. Browning's primary object was to prevent publications which would have been excessively distressing to his feelings; but the letters, when once thus collected, were not destroyed (as was the case with many of his own letters), but carefully preserved, and so passed into the possession of his son, Mr. R. Barrett Browning, with whose consent they are now published. In this collection are comprised the letters to Miss Browning (the poet's sister, whose consent has also been freely given to the publication), Mr. H.S. Boyd, Mrs. Martin, Miss Mitford, Mrs. Jameson, Mr. John Kenyon, Mr. Chorley, Miss Blagden, Miss Haworth, and Miss Thomson (Madame Emil Braun).[1] To these have been added a number of letters which have been kindly lent by their possessors for <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> volumes.|$|E

50|$|DST is {{inspired}} by two thinkers in particular, William James and Mikhail Bakhtin, who worked in different countries (USA and Russia, respectively), in different disciplines (psychology and literary sciences), and in different theoretical traditions (pragmatism and dialogism). As the composite term dialogical self suggests, the present theory finds itself not exclusively {{in one of these}} traditions but explicitly at their intersection. As a theory about the self it {{is inspired}} by William James, as a theory about dialogue it elaborates on some insights of Mikhail Bakhtin. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> theory is to profit from the insights of founding fathers like William James, George Herbert Mead and Mikhail Bakhtin and, at the same time, to go beyond them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> {{paper is}} to {{describe}} a test procedure which has shown promise in this direction and to give descriptions of equipment which have been found helpful in minimizing the variability of the test results. The procedure, which we have called the “ABX” test, is a modification of the method of paired comparisons. An observer is presented with a time sequence of three signals for each judgment he is asked to make. During the first time interval he hears signal A, during the second, signal B, and finally signal X. His task is to indicate whether the sound heard during the X interval was more like that during the A interval or more like that during the B interval. For a threshold test, the A interval is quiet, the B interval is signal, and the X interval is either quiet or signal.The test has evolved to other variations such as user control over duration and sequence of testing. One such example was the hardware ABX comparator in 1977, built by the ABX company in Troy, Michigan, and documented {{by one of his}} founders, David Clark in his Audio Engineering Society Journal Paper, High-Resolution Subjective Testing Using a Double-Blind Comparator ...|$|E
