"Padre Pio {{looked at}} Lefebvre very sternly and said: [...] "Never cause discord among your {{brothers}} and always practise {{the rule of}} obedience; above all when it seems {{to you that the}} errors of those in authority are all the more serious. There is no other road than that of obedience, especially for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> made this vow."... It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father." [...] Padre Pio looked at him intensely and, seeing what would soon happen, said: [...] "No! You will forget it! You will tear apart the community of faithful, oppose the will of your superiors and even go against the orders of the pope himself and this will happen quite soon..." ...|$|E

They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{review of}} the book noted, [...] "Prisoners is Jeffrey Goldberg’s sensitive, forthright and {{perceptive}} account of {{his years as a}} soldier and journalist in Israel—and of his long-running conversation with a Palestinian whom he once kept under lock and key. It is a forceful reminder of how rewarding, and how difficult, discourse between Israelis and Palestinians can be.” CBS News critic wrote, [...] "There is no shortage of histories, polemics and policy manuals about the Middle East. An honest but complex story, from what happens to be a personal perspective that many Americans can at least conjure, is a rarer opportunity for insight. And that is what Jeffrey Goldberg, a reporter for The New Yorker, delivers in Prisoners. To <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> followed Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting on the Muslim world, the publication of his first book is cause for real pleasure...because his writing on the subject has always been exceptional: wise, unpretentious, and at times, unexpectedly funny.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 18, 2013, David Miranda, {{partner of}} {{journalist}} Glenn Greenwald, was detained for nine hours under Schedule 7 of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act of 2000. Miranda was returning from Berlin, carrying 58,000 GCHQ documents {{on a single}} computer file to Greenwald in Brazil. Greenwald described Miranda's detention as [...] "clearly intended {{to send a message}} of intimidation to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ". The Metropolitan Police and Home Secretary Theresa May called Miranda's detention [...] "legally and procedurally sound". However, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who helped introduce the bill in the House of Lords, said that under the act, police can only detain someone [...] "to assess whether they are involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism." [...] He said, [...] "I am very clear that this does not apply, either on its terms or in its spirit, to Mr Miranda." [...] Antonio Patriota the Brazilian Minister of External Relations said that Miranda's detention was [...] "not justifiable". The reasons for Miranda's detention were sought from the police by British politicians and David Anderson Q.C., the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The United States government later said that British officials had given them a [...] "heads up" [...] about Miranda's detention, while adding that the decision to detain him had been a British one.|$|E
