5|$|The McMaster Model is the university's {{policy for}} a student-centred, problem-based, {{interdisciplinary}} approach to learning, a policy {{which has been}} adopted by several other universities around the world. During the 1960s the McMaster University Medical School pioneered problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials that have since been adopted by other programs and faculties within the university. PBL is now used in medicine, occupational therapy, physical therapy, nursing, midwifery, and other allied fields. Most medical schools in Canada and more than 80 percent of medical schools in the United States employ PBL in <b>their</b> <b>curriculum,</b> and many international universities do the same.|$|E
5|$|Singing {{schools in}} Baltimore were {{few in number}} until the 1830s. Singing masters began {{incorporating}} secular music into <b>their</b> <b>curriculum,</b> and divested themselves from sponsoring churches, {{in the early part}} of the 1830s. Attendance increased drastically, especially after the founding of two important institutions: the Academy, established in 1834 by Ruel Shaw, and the Musical Institute, founded by John Hill Hewitt and William Stoddard. The Academy and the Institute quickly became rivals, and both gave successful performances. Some Baltimore singing masters used new terminology to describe their programs, as the term singing school was falling out of favor; Alonzo Cleaveland founded the Glee School during this era, focusing entirely on secular music. In contrast, religious musical instruction by the middle of the 19th century remained based around itinerant singing masters who taught for a period of time, then continued to new locations.|$|E

5|$|The 4 MINDS schools offer four {{programs}}; Pre-School, Junior, Senior and Special {{programs for}} pupils who have Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and are severely disabled intellectually or have challenging behaviours. The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and {{the focus is on the}} functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the holistic development of pupils, the schools have within <b>their</b> <b>curriculum</b> time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a holistic approach to the development of pupils and support for their families.|$|E
5|$|US {{cast members}} Kevin Clash and Marty Robinson have cast and trained the {{international}} puppeteers. At first, Muppet builder Kermit Love constructed the puppets {{for the new}} shows in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, Jim Henson's Creature Shop, overseen by Connie Peterson, has taken over puppet creation. The producers of Sisimpur, the Bangladesh co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and {{an important part of}} their culture. The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research to ascertain whether <b>their</b> <b>curriculum</b> goals were met, just as was done in the US after the first season of Sesame Street. According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, riots and conflicts between Serbs and Albanians in 2004 delayed production of the Kosovo co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.|$|E
