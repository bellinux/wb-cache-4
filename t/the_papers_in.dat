5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the modern bassoon owes {{a great deal to}} the performer, teacher, and {{composer}} Carl Almenräder. Assisted by the German acoustic researcher Gottfried Weber, he developed the 17-key bassoon with a range spanning four octaves. Almenräder's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise describing ways of improving intonation, response, and technical ease of playing by augmenting and rearranging the keywork. Subsequent articles further developed his ideas. His employment at Schott gave him the freedom to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, and he published the results in Caecilia, Schott's house journal. Almenräder continued publishing and building instruments until his death in 1846, and Ludwig van Beethoven himself requested one of the newly made instruments after hearing of <b>the</b> <b>papers.</b> <b>In</b> 1831, Almenräder left Schott to start his own factory with a partner, Johann Adam Heckel.|$|E

25|$|By 1985 {{the number}} of {{institutions}} of higher learning had again increased - to slightly more than 1,000. The State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance issued a joint declaration for nationwide unified enrollment of adult students - not the regular secondary-school graduates but the members of the work force who qualified for admission by taking a test. The State Education Commission established unified questions and time and evaluation criteria for the test and authorized provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities to administer the test, grade <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> a uniform manner, and determine the minimum points required for admission. The various schools were to enroll students according to the results. Adult students needed to have the educational equivalent of senior-middle-school graduates, and those applying for release or partial release from work to study were to be under forty years of age. Staff members and workers were to apply to study job-related subjects with review by and approval of their respective work units. If employers paid for the college courses, the workers had to take entrance examinations. In 1985 colleges enrolled 33,000 employees from various enterprises and companies, approximately 6 percent of the total college enrollment.|$|E
500|$|The first {{publication}} to divide <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> {{such a way}} was an 1810 edition that used a list left by Hamilton to associate the authors with their numbers; this edition appeared as two volumes of the compiled [...] "Works of Hamilton". In 1818, Jacob Gideon published a new edition with a new listing of authors, based on a list provided by Madison. The difference between Hamilton's list and Madison's {{formed the basis for}} a dispute over the authorship of a dozen of the essays.|$|E

500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer {{continued}} {{to struggle to}} make a profit, due to competition from digital media sources. By May 2012 the combined journalist staff at all of Philadelphia Media Network was about 320 {{and some of the}} same stories and photographs appear both in The Inquirer and Daily News. On April 2, 2012, a group of local business leaders paid $55 million for the paper, less than 15 percent of the $515 million spent to buy <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> 2006. In June 2014, PMN was sold to H.F. [...] "Gerry" [...] Lenfest, who appointed C.Z. [...] "Terry" [...] Egger as publisher and CEO in October 2015. In 2016, Lenfest donated PMN to The Philadelphia Foundation, so that The Inquirer, its sister newspaper, the Daily News, and their joint website, Philly.com, could remain in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, {{the spread}} of the {{automobile}} and the improvement of roads in the United States made it easier for rural residents to do their shopping in larger towns farther from their homes. [...] This gave merchants an incentive to advertise in newspapers that reached such residents. [...] However, delivering <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> a timely fashion became a problem for the publishers. [...] The U.S. Mail was expensive, since postage rates for newspapers had been raised drastically by the War Revenue Act of 1917; it also took several days for the papers to reach some customers. [...] In more developed parts of the country, publishers delivered papers by truck to local carriers in outlying towns. [...] However, the improvement of roads in the McCook area was slower than in more densely populated areas. [...] By 1929, U.S. Highway 38 (now U.S. Highway 6) had not yet been fully gravelled in southwestern Nebraska, and most roads off the main highways were impassable in bad weather.|$|E
500|$|The Federalist {{articles}} {{appeared in}} three New York newspapers: The Independent Journal, the New-York Packet, and the Daily Advertiser, beginning on October 27, 1787. Although written and published with haste, The Federalist articles were widely read and greatly influenced {{the shape of}} American political institutions. Between them, Hamilton, Madison and Jay kept up a rapid pace, with at times three or four new essays by Publius appearing in <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> a week. Garry Wills observes that the pace of production [...] "overwhelmed" [...] any possible response: [...] "Who, given ample time could have answered such a battery of arguments? And no time was given." [...] Hamilton also encouraged the reprinting of the essay in newspapers outside New York state, and indeed they were published in several other states where the ratification debate was taking place. However, they were only irregularly published outside New York, and {{in other parts of}} the country they were often overshadowed by local writers.|$|E

500|$|Early {{editorial}} cartooning {{lacked a}} local flavour, tending to be a pale imitation of American examples. It {{tended to be}} cheery, non-confrontational, and supported good causes. Following the War it broke from typical American clichés and took on more of a savage bite, especially compared to the more allegorical tendencies of American editorial cartoons. At Le Devoir, Robert Lapalme {{was the first to}} cartoon in this particularly Canadian idiom, and in 1963 organized an International Salon of Caricature and Cartoon in Montreal. Lapalme was later followed by Duncan Macpherson at the Toronto Star, Leonard Norris at the Vancouver Sun and Ed McNally at the Montreal Star. These cartoonists frequently took political positions contrary to those of <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> which they were published. Macpherson drew a cartoon of John Diefenbaker as Marie Antoinette saying [...] "Let them eat cake" [...] in response to the Prime Minister's cancelling the Avro Arrow project, which historian Pierre Burton has called the beginning of Canadians' disillusionment with Diefenbaker's government. Macpherson in particular fought fiercely for editorial independence, challenging his editors and threatening to quit the Star if not given his way, which paved a new path for other cartoonists to follow.|$|E
500|$|Murray's {{first contact}} {{when he moved}} to London was William Hamilton, a Scottish-born {{barrister}} who was said to be the first Scot to practise at the English Bar, {{and one of the few}} people who was qualified to act as a barrister in both England and Scotland. Hamilton had been one of Murray's sponsors when he joined Lincoln's Inn in 1724, and when Murray came to London, Hamilton helped find him a set of chambers at No. 1 Old Square. At this time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be called to the Bar was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln's Inn, and to have read the first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward. Thus, most of Murray's practical training came from reading <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> Hamilton's chambers and listening to Lord Raymond speak in court, along with tutoring by Thomas Denison on how to write special pleadings. Murray also studied various texts, including the French Ordinance de la Marine (a predecessor to the Napoleonic Commercial Code), the works of Bracton and Littleton and [...] "crabbed and uncouth compositions" [...] on municipal law.|$|E
500|$|Gravel, too, {{wanted to}} privately publish {{the portion of}} the papers he had read into the record, believing that [...] "immediate {{disclosure}} of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war." [...] After being turned down by many commercial publishers, on August 4 he reached agreement with Beacon Press, the publishing arm of the Unitarian Universalist Association, of which Gravel was a member. Announced on August 17 and published on October 22, 1971, this four-volume, relatively expensive set became the [...] "Senator Gravel Edition", which studies from Cornell University and the Annenberg Center for Communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the Pentagon Papers to be published. The [...] "Gravel Edition" [...] was edited and annotated by Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war, also edited by Chomsky and Zinn. Beacon Press then was subjected to a FBI investigation; an outgrowth of this was the Gravel v. United States court case, which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled upon in June 1972; it held that the Speech or Debate Clause did grant immunity to Gravel for his reading <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> his subcommittee, did grant some immunity to Gravel's congressional aide, but granted no immunity to Beacon Press in relation to their publishing the same papers.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Susan {{was seen}} {{offering}} {{to become a}} surrogate for her daughter Libby. Following a fight with the hospital board, Susan became pregnant. However, this causes friction with her son-in-law. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Woodburne called the scenes [...] "difficult" [...] to film. Alan Fletcher said the storyline [...] "could have been dreadful in the wrong hands", but he was pleased {{at the way the}} scenes were handled. He added [...] "The notion of a mother being a surrogate for their daughter is something you can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family". Neighbours timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline. The writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. Woodburne said [...] "Because of the time of day that our show is on—it's on at 6.30 here and day time in the UK—obviously doing something as controversial as surrogacy at that time slot we would be so restricted by censorship". The storyline received mixed reactions from viewers. Woodburne said that people believe Susan is [...] "such a good mother and it's awesome she's prepared to do this for Libby and Dan". Other viewers have said that Susan should not have got involved and that the storyline was ridiculous as Susan is too old. Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower also spoke out about the storyline and said [...] "I've had quite a few letters from people in England who'd heard about it before it was even in <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>in</b> Australia saying they disagree and think it's shocking".|$|E
