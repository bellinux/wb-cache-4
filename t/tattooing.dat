Fresh gum {{was used as a}} type of chewing gum (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the gum was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with animal fat, it made a dark pigment for moko <b>tattooing.</b> Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E
5|$|Life {{under the}} Japanese changed rapidly {{as many of}} the {{traditional}} structures were replaced by a military power. Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including <b>tattooing.</b> By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to serve in Special Units and if need be die for the Emperor of Japan. The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between prison <b>tattoos</b> and the criminal lifestyle and recidivism. Participants consisted of 81 male inmates with prison <b>tattoos</b> (i. e., prison-themed or prison-made <b>tattoos),</b> 75 inmates with nonprison <b>tattoos</b> (e. g., animal <b>tattoos,</b> <b>tattoos</b> of ethnic origin), 52 male inmates with no <b>tattoos,</b> and 66 college students with <b>tattoos.</b> Results indicated that inmates with prison <b>tattoos</b> differed from inmates with nonprison <b>tattoos,</b> inmates without <b>tattoos,</b> and college students with <b>tattoos</b> with regard to criminal thinking styles, were at increased risk of recidivism, and presented more institutional behavioral problems, resulting in more disciplinary infractions. There were no significant differences between inmate groups with regard to number of convictions; however, additional group comparisons indicated that inmates with visible <b>tattoos</b> and antisocial-themed <b>tattoos</b> were at greater risk for recidivism and received more disciplinary infractions than inmates without visible or antisocial-themed <b>tattoos.</b> Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Some wearers {{decide to}} cover an {{unwanted}} <b>tattoo</b> {{with a new}} <b>tattoo.</b> This {{is commonly known as}} a cover-up. An artfully done cover-up may render the old <b>tattoo</b> completely invisible, though this will depend largely on the size, style, colors and techniques used on the old <b>tattoo</b> and the skill of the <b>tattoo</b> artist. Covering up a previous <b>tattoo</b> necessitates darker tones in the new <b>tattoo</b> to effectively hide the older, unwanted piece. Many <b>tattoos</b> are too dark to cover up and in those cases patients may receive laser <b>tattoo</b> removal to lighten the existing ink to make themselves better candidates for a cover up <b>tattoo.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for <b>tattooing,</b> and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included <b>tattooing</b> the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tattoos</b> {{on human}} body provide {{important}} {{clue to the}} identity of a suspect. While a <b>tattoo</b> is not an unique identifier, it narrows down the list of identities for the suspect. For these reasons, law enforcement agencies have been collecting <b>tattoo</b> images of the suspects at the time of booking. A few successful {{attempts have been made to}} design an automatic system to search a <b>tattoo</b> database to identify near-duplicate images of a query <b>tattoo</b> image. However, in many scenarios, the surveillance image of the crime scene is not available, so the query is in the form of a sketch of a <b>tattoo</b> (as opposed to an image of a <b>tattoo)</b> drawn based on the description provided by an eyewitness. In this paper, we extend the capability of <b>tattoo</b> image-to-image matching by proposing a method to match <b>tattoo</b> sketches to <b>tattoo</b> images using local invariant features. Specifically, <b>tattoo</b> shape is first extracted from both <b>tattoo</b> sketch and <b>tattoo</b> image using Canny edge detector. Local patterns are then extracted from <b>tattoo</b> shape as well as <b>tattoo</b> image (appearance) using SIFT. A local feature based sparse representation classification scheme is then used for matching.

25|$|Since tattoo {{instruments}} come {{in contact}} with blood and bodily fluids, diseases may be transmitted if the instruments are used on more than one person without being sterilised. However, infection from <b>tattooing</b> in clean and modern tattoo studios employing single-use needles is rare.

To address this problem, a programme was introduced in Canada as of the summer of 2005 that provides legal <b>tattooing</b> in prisons, both to reduce health risks and to provide inmates with a marketable skill.
