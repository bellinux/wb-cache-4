5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E

25|$|Outside of Earth, carbon {{monoxide}} is the second-most common molecule in the interstellar medium, after molecular hydrogen.

It is now {{the most commonly used}} tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies, as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires space telescopes.
