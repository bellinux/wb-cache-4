25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that monasteries became secret bastions of icon-support, but this view is controversial. A possible reason for this interpretation is the desire in some historiography on Byzantine Iconoclasm <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a preface to the later Protestant Reformation in western Europe, in which monastic establishments suffered damage and persecution. In opposition to this view, others have suggested that while some monks continued to support image veneration, many others followed church and imperial policy.|$|E
25|$|Also {{strongly}} {{critical of}} reductionist accounts of mind (e.g., behaviorism), he maintained {{to the contrary}} that mind {{is the reality of}} which we are in fact most certain. Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at truth, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes about, in his view, through a grasp of necessity: to understand (or explain) something is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> necessitated within a system of which it is a part.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{understand}} the motivation behind systems engineering is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within {{a wide variety of}} systems.

Besides defense and aerospace, many information and technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the field of electronics & communications require systems engineers as part of their team.|$|E

25|$|Classically, the {{bringing}} of unconscious {{thoughts and}} feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so. Another important element of psychoanalysis is transference, {{the process by which}} patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{an essential part of the}} therapeutic process.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s {{like many}} city theatres, {{it had been}} policy to close during the summer while many city {{residents}} headed to the coast for their holidays, but this all changed in 1933 when the then managing director of Howard & Wyndham, A. Stewart Cruikshank, decided to experiment with a quality show, a cocktail of music, laughter and song, to outmatch the seaside-style summer shows. The show started at 8.30pm and was changed weekly, attracting huge crowds. The record run of 31 weeks under the top billing of Dave Willis remains unbroken in variety history. The first such show was on 5 June 1933, and was imaginatively titled the Half Past Eight Show. This successful summer tradition continued, with changes becoming fortnightly to allow as many people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} human {{security}} has developed {{out of the}} precepts put forth by the United Nations, wherein there has been critique of Human Security's focus on what is deemed acceptable behaviors. Human security perspectives view practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation {{as a threat to}} human (more specifically women) security and well-being in the Global North, while it is more common that these events occur predominately in the Global Southern states. Thus it is seen by states with a traditional human security outlook, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> their duty to intervene and perpetuate this eurocentric ideal of what human security looks like, and what is best to protect the familiar concept of women. This can be seen as an infringement on the traditional practices found within some sovereign states of the Global South, and a threat to ways of life and processes of development.|$|E

25|$|This {{uncommon}} modern formation {{focuses on}} ball possession in the midfield. In fact, {{it is very}} rare <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an initial formation, as it is more useful for maintaining a lead or tie score. Its more common variants are 3–4–2–1 or 3–4–3 diamond, which use two wing-backs. The lone forward must be tactically gifted, not only because he focuses on scoring but also on playing the ball back towards the own goal to assist with back passes to his teammates. Once the team is leading the game, there is an even stronger tactical focus on ball control, short passes and running down the clock. On the other hand, when the team is losing, {{at least one of}} the playmakers will more frequently play in the edge of the area to add depth to the attack. Guus Hiddink is one of the few coaches who has used this formation, recently for Australia during the 2006 World Cup.|$|E
25|$|The Vendée revolt {{became an}} {{immediate}} symbol of confrontation between revolution and counterrevolution, {{and a source}} of unexpurgated violence. The region, and its towns, were eliminated; even the department name of Vendée was renamed Venge. Towns and cities were also renamed, but at heart, in villages and farms, the old names remained the same. Beyond the controversial interpretations of genocide, other historians posit the insurrection as a revolt against conscription that cascaded to include other complaints. For a period of several months, control of the Vendée slipped from the hands of Parisian revolutionaries. They ascribed the revolt to the resurgence of royalist ideas: when faced with insurrection of the people against the Revolution of the People, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> anything but an aristocratic plot. Mona Ozouf and François Furet maintain it was not. The entire territory, none of it unified under a single idea from the ancien regime, had never been a region morally at odds {{with the rest of the}} nation. It was not the fall of the old regime that aroused the population against the Revolution, but rather the construction of the new regime into locally unacceptable principles and forms: the new map of districts and departments, the administrative dictatorship, and above all the non-juring priests. Rebellion had first flared in August 1792, but had been immediately quelled. Even the regicide did not trigger insurrection. What did was the forced conscription. Although the Vendeans, to use the term loosely, wrote God and King large on their flags, they invested those symbols of their tradition with something other than regret for the lost regime.|$|E

25|$|With the South African tour {{cancelled}} {{a new one}} {{was arranged}} to Ceylon and Pakistan, which was in political turmoil {{that resulted in the}} fall of President Ayub Khan and imposition of martial law by his successor General Yahya Khan. After a few easy-going matches in Ceylon the tour match against the West Pakistan Governor's XI saw play abandoned after 25 overs, there were no other tour matches and all the Tests were affected by political demonstrations against the military regime. In the First Test at Lahore Cowdrey won the toss and made exactly 100, his 22nd Test century to match Wally Hammond's England record. England made 309, dismissed Pakistan for 209 and Cowdrey declared the second innings at 225/9 to give them 326 to win, but Pakistan made 203/5 for a draw. Saeed Ahmed won the toss in the Second Test at Dacca in East Pakistan, soon to be Bangladesh, where there was rioting and gunfire around the team hotel. Pakistan made 246, which was matched by England's 274, thanks to D'Oliveira's 114 not out. Pakistan took 101 overs to make 196/5 and a token declaration left England to make 33/0. Cowdrey won the toss again in the Third Test at Karachi, but there were riots on the first two days by fans who wanted Hanif Mohammad as captain instead of Saeed. England piled up 502/7, with Colin Milburn making 139 and Tom Graveney 105, but the match was abandoned after demonstrators wrecked the stadium {{on the morning of the}} third day, leaving Alan Knott stranded on 96 not out. Cowdrey was not there <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> he left on the second day after his father-in-law died, leaving Graveney in charge. The team followed on the third day, with manager Les Ames abandoning the Test and the rest of the tour to save the team.|$|E

[...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed to the need for a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens.

500|$|Because it {{was known}} in ancient and medieval times that a solar eclipse could not take place during Passover (solar eclipses require a new moon while Passover only takes place during a full moon), it was {{considered}} a miraculous sign rather than a naturally occurring event.

Modern writers who regard this as a miraculous event tend either <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> operating through a natural phenomenon—such as volcanic dust or heavy cloud cover—or avoid explanation completely.
