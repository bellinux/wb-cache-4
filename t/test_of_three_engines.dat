ChapmanThe {{increasingly}} strict {{air emission}} regulations may require implementing Non-Selective Catalytic Reduction (NSCR) systems as a promising emission control technology for stationary rich burn spark ignition engines. Many recent experimental investigations that used NSCR systems for stationary natural gas fueled engines showed that NSCR systems {{were unable to}} consistently control the exhaust emissions level below the compliance limits. Part of this thesis is devoted to show {{the results from the}} field <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>engines</b> working in natural gas gathering stations located in the “Four Corners” area. These <b>three</b> <b>engines</b> are retrofitted with NSCR systems. Emissions and engine operating data were monitored for more than one year. Data collected from October 2007 through December 2008 shows significant variation in emissions levels over hours, days, and longer periods of time, as well as seasonal variations. As a result of these variations, simultaneous control of NOx and CO below the compliance limit was achieved less than fifty percent of the monitored time. Modeling of NSCR components to better understand, and then exploit, the underlying physical processes that occur in the lambda sensor and the catalyst media is now considered an essential step toward improving NSCR system performance. The second portion of this thesis focuses on modeling the lambda sensor that provides feedback to the air-to-fuel ratio controller. Correct interpretation of the sensor output signal is necessary to achieve consistently low emissions level. The goal of this modeling study is to improve the understanding of the physical processes that occur within the sensor, investigate the cross-sensitivity of various exhaust gas species on the sensor performance, and finally this model serves as a tool to improve NSCR control strategies. This model simulates the output from a planar switch type lambda sensor. The model consists <b>of</b> <b>three</b> modules. The first module models the multi-component mass transport through the sensor protective layer. Diffusion fluxes are calculated using the Maxwell-Stefan equation. The second module includes all the surface catalytic reactions that take place on the sensor platinum electrodes. All kinetic reactions are modeled based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic mechanism. The third module is responsible for simulating the reactions that occur on the electrolyte material and determine the sensor output voltage. The details <b>of</b> these <b>three</b> modules as well as a parametric study that investigates the sensitivity of the output voltage signal to various exhaust gas parameters is provided in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The J- 2 X engine, {{a liquid}} oxygen/liquid {{hydrogen}} propellant rocket engine available {{for future use}} on the upper stage of the Space Launch System vehicle, has completed <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> developmental <b>engines</b> at NASA Stennis Space Center. Twenty-one <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> engine E 10001 were conducted from June 2011 through September 2012, thirteen <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> the engine E 10002 were conducted from February 2013 through September 2013, and twelve <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> engine E 10003 were conducted from November 2013 to April 2014. Verification of combustion stability of the thrust chamber assembly was conducted by perturbing each <b>of</b> the <b>three</b> developmental <b>engines.</b> The primary mechanism for combustion stability verification was examining the response caused by an artificial perturbation (bomb) in the main combustion chamber, i. e., dynamic combustion stability rating. No dynamic instabilities were observed in the TCA, although a few conditions were not bombed. Additional requirements, included to guard against spontaneous instability or rough combustion, were also investigated. Under certain conditions, discrete responses were observed in the dynamic pressure data. The discrete responses were of low amplitude and posed minimal risk to safe engine operability. Rough combustion analyses showed that all <b>three</b> <b>engines</b> met requirements for broad-banded frequency oscillations. Start and shutdown transient chug oscillations were also examined to assess the overall stability characteristics, with no major issues observed...|$|R
40|$|NASA's Office of Aeronautics and Space Transportation Technology (OASTT) {{established}} {{the following three}} major goals, referred to as "The Three Pillars for Success": Global Civil Aviation, Revolutionary Technology Leaps, and Access to Space. The Advanced Space Transportation Program Office (ASTP) at the NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. focuses on future space transportation technologies under the "Access to Space" pillar. The Propulsion Projects within ASTP under the investment area of Spaceliner 100, focus on the earth-to-orbit (ETO) third generation reusable launch vehicle technologies. The goals of Spaceliner 100 is to reduce cost {{by a factor of}} 100 and improve safety by a factor of 10, 000 over current conditions. The ETO Propulsion Projects in ASTP, are actively developing combination/combined-cycle propulsion technologies that utilized airbreathing propulsion during a major portion of the trajectory. System integration, components, materials and advanced rocket technologies are also being pursued. Over the last several years, one of the main thrusts has been to develop rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) technologies. The focus has been on conducting ground <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> several engine designs to establish the RBCC flowpaths performance. Flowpath <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> different RBCC <b>engine</b> designs is progressing. Additionally, vehicle system studies are being conducted to assess potential operational space access vehicles utilizing combined-cycle propulsion systems. The design, manufacturing, and ground <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> a scale flight-type engine are planned. The first flight demonstration of an airbreathing combined cycle propulsion system is envisioned around 2005. The paper will describe the advanced propulsion technologies that are being being developed under the ETO activities in the ASTP program. Progress, findings, and future activities for the propulsion technologies will be discussed...|$|R
