50|$|Skills {{learned through}} the {{discipline}} of music may <b>transfer</b> to study <b>skills,</b> <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> and cognitive skills useful {{in every part of}} a child's studies at school, though. An in-depth Harvard University study found evidence that spatial-temporal reasoning improves when children learn to make music, and this kind of reasoning improves temporarily when adults listen to certain kinds of music, including Mozart. This finding (named The Mozart effect) suggests that music and spatial reasoning are related psychologically (i.e., they may rely on some of the same underlying skills) and perhaps neurologically as well. However, there has been considerable controversy over this as later researchers have failed to reproduce the original findings of Rauscher (e.g. Steele, Bass & Crook, 1999), questioned both theory and methodology of the original study (Fudis & Lembesis 2004) and suggested that the enhancing effects of music in experiments have been simply due to an increased level of arousal (Thompson, Schellenberg & Husain, 2001).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} measuring job skills using survey data on detailed work activities, and using these measures examines whether the utilisation of skills is growing, {{and how they are}} valued in the labour market. We show that between 1997 and 2001 there was a growth in Britain in the utilisation of computing skills, literacy, numeracy, technical know-how, high-level <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> planning <b>skills,</b> client <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> horizontal <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> problem-solving, and checking skills. Computer skills utilisation was growing the fastest, and the use of computers was becoming more sophisticated. We re-evaluate the issue of whether computers have affected wages, taking into account existing critiques in the literature. We find that both computer <b>skills</b> and high-level <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> carry positive wage premia, as shown both in cross-section hedonic wage equations that control for many detailed activities, and through a within-cohorts change analysis.

An expert group of doctors and nurses performed better on the SJT than a group drawn from occupations outside the health area. However, problems were noted with internal consistency reliability estimates for the SJT, suggesting that the effects noted above are underestimates of the true relationships. We conclude that if these problems can be overcome, SJTs have the potential to contribute to the selection of health professionals...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} generic job skills, derived from survey data on detailed job activities, is demonstrated. Using factor analysis, indices are derived for literacy, numeracy, physical <b>skills,</b> technical know-how, high-level <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> planning <b>skills,</b> client <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> horizontal <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> problem-solving skills and checking skills. Indices are also derived for task diversity and autonomy, and for computing skills, capturing both {{the centrality of}} computer use {{and the level of}} complexity with which computers are used. Based on British surveys in 1997 and 2001, it is shown that there is an upward movement in most of these generic skills, the single exception being physical skills. Computing skills stand out as expanding rapidly. In cross-section hedonic wage equations, some generic skills, including computer <b>skills</b> and highlevel <b>communication</b> <b>skills,</b> carry positive wage premia while others, such as physical skills, are associated with lower wages. Some of the cross-section associations are attributable to firm- or individual- effects, and only computer and high-level <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> are shown to significantly affect the growth of pay in a cohort analysis. Over and above the impact of the individual job-holder’s tasks, more intensive computer use by the establishment’s workforce raises pay. While computers at the establishment are associated with higher pay for managers, their individual computer use does not attract a wage premium. Finally, no part of the gender pay gap can be accounted for by differences in levels of generic skills between men and women...|$|R

Objective: To synthesise critically and summarise the best available evidence of the effects of rehabilitation on intellectually-disabled people. Method: Literature searches of different electronic databases and manual searches were conducted using selected keywords. Studies on the effects of rehabilitation on intellectually-disabled people were selected systematically, appraised critically for methodological quality and summarised. Results: Rehabilitation interventions indicated good outcomes with regard to intellectually-disabled people. Findings showed that people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities improved in terms of activities of daily living (ADL) after rehabilitation. Improvement was noted in ADL, self-care <b>skills,</b> <b>communication</b> <b>skills</b> and cognitive achievements.
