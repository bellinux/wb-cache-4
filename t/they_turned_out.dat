25|$|From the 1860s to 1880s, {{settlers}} in Burrard Inlet used Brockton Point, Anderson Point, and nearby Deadman's Island as burial grounds. This practice stopped when the Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1887. Deadman's Island {{had already had}} a long history as a burial site. In 1865, unsuspecting newcomer John Morton found old cedar boxes in the trees. <b>They</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be coffins that had been placed there to keep the remains of important indigenous persons out of reach of wild animals.|$|E
25|$|WR {{recruits}} {{were promised}} uniforms upon reaching boot camp, {{but that was}} not always the case. In fact, during the summer of 1943, some recruits had to train in civilian clothing until uniforms were available. When the new uniforms arrived, <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be winter uniforms. The seersucker summer uniforms had yet to be designed. Disputes about fabric, cut, and production had a delaying affect upon delivery. In time, these issues were resolved, and most WR members felt their uniforms were much better looking than those of the other women's military organizations.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s young artists {{began to break}} away stylistically from {{abstract}} expressionism; experimenting with new ways of making pictures; and new ways of handling paint and color. In the early 1960s several and various new movements in abstract painting were closely related to each other, and superficially were categorized together; although <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be profoundly different in the long run. Some of the new styles and movements {{that appeared in the}} early 1960s as responses to abstract expressionism were called: Washington Color School, Hard-edge painting, Geometric abstraction, Minimalism, and Color Field.|$|E
25|$|In 1861 Bummer rescued another dog from a {{fight with}} a larger canine opponent. The rescued dog was badly injured, with a deep wound on his leg, and was not {{expected}} to live. Bummer coaxed him to eat, brought back scraps from his scavenging missions and huddled next to him to keep him warm during the night. The injured dog quickly recovered and within days was following Bummer {{as he made his}} begging rounds in the streets. His remarkable recovery earned him the name Lazarus, and he proved to be an even more prodigious ratter than Bummer.

25|$|At {{the time}} the bridge was built, {{engineers}} had not discovered the aerodynamics of bridge construction. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s, well {{after the collapse of}} the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, known as Galloping Gertie, in 1940. It is therefore fortunate that the open truss structure supporting the deck is by its nature less subject to aerodynamic problems. Roebling designed a bridge and truss system that was six times as strong as he thought it needed to be. Because of this, the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing when many of the bridges built around the same time have vanished or been replaced. This is also in spite of the substitution of inferior quality wire in the cabling supplied by the contractor J. Lloyd Haigh—by the time it was discovered, it was too late to replace the cabling that had already been constructed. Roebling determined that the poorer wire would leave the bridge four rather than six times as strong as necessary, so it was eventually allowed to stand, with the addition of 250 cables. Diagonal cables were installed from the towers to the deck, intended to stiffen the bridge. <b>They</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be unnecessary, but were kept for their distinctive beauty.|$|E

25|$|Captain George Nicholas Hardinge (11 April 1781 – 8 March 1808) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Navy who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Possessing an ability to endear himself to senior {{officers}} through his intellect and good manners, he served under several important naval commanders, whose patronage allowed him to rise through the ranks. His own skill and bravery were also important factors in his promotion to his own command, a fact he demonstrated in 1804 when he led a daring cutting-out operation against two Dutch ships. Promotion to post captain left him temporarily without a command, and he was to be disappointed in a number of the ships he was offered when <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be either unfit for service, or still under construction. Having ended up in the East Indies he was forced to make do with an elderly frigate he had first served on as a midshipman much earlier in his career. While commanding this ship he fought an action with a superior French opponent, and after a gruelling three-day battle the British were victorious and the French captain surrendered. Hardinge did not live to see the moment, having been killed by grapeshot shortly before. He was buried with full military honours and monuments to his memory were erected in St. Thomas Cathedral, Bombay and St Paul's Cathedral, London.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, El Salvador {{appointed}} its first official national coach, American Mark Scott Thompson, {{in preparation for}} the 1930 Central American and Caribbean Games in Havana, Cuba. El Salvador finished in fourth place at the games. The Federación Salvadoreña de Fútbol, the official governing football organization in El Salvador, was founded in 1935. By this time, El Salvador were coached by Spaniard Pablo Ferre Elías. The El Salvador-hosted 1935 Central American and Caribbean Games took place in the new government funded Estadio Flor Blanca, at that time the biggest stadium in the country. The Salvadoran squad consisted of Edmundo Majano as goalkeeper; Tobias Rivera and Raúl Castro in defense; Américo Gonzalez and Napoleon Cañas as midfielders; and Álex Morales, Rogelio Aviles, Fidel Quintanilla, Miguel [...] "Americano" [...] Cruz, and Andrés Hernández as strikers.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that {{there had not been}} many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how [...] "crummy" [...] the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how [...] "crummy" [...] and [...] "dismal" [...] Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The [...] "way they radiate out" [...] had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided {{to put it in the}} clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular".|$|E

Winnberg stated, [...] "We knew that the song broke all the rules we had, [...] When she came to the studio, she was extremely psyched, had learned the lyrics by heart in the car, and recorded the song on half an hour."
