500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, {{it looks like a}} great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably {{not going to be in}} a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought {{the news to}} the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{a few minutes and}} then announced to Placzek, LÃ©on Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that [...] "I have understood everything." [...] Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on [...] "The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission".|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked what}} they would do if he induced his comrades to {{surrender}}. Kelly stated, [...] "I'll shoot no man if he holds up his hands", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, [...] "You can depend on us." [...] Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly [...] "lagged" [...] at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was some}} time after this {{incident}} that we discovered Japhet to be missing; at least we could no longer touch him, nor did he answer when we called.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} Leigh Whannell was asked [...] "If {{there is a}} fourth Insidious film, {{would that be a}} sequel to Chapter 3, another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline?"

[...] Ansari and Yang rewrote the script to make the character more like Waithe: [...] "All of us actors play heightened versions of ourselves." [...] She said, [...] "I don't know if we've seen a sly, harem pants-wearing, cool Topshop sweatshirt-wearing, snapback hat-rocking lesbian on TV." [...] She also said, [...] "I know how many women I see out in the world who are very much like myself. We exist.

Just as we had got into the town--it was before the row began, and being early in the morning, there were very few people about--a head {{appeared}} at a window {{on the second floor of}} a big convent standing on the left side of the road. I remember the name was carved over the door-it was the Convent of Santa Maria. I happened to catch sight of the nun, and she at once dropped a little letter, which fell close to me. I picked it up and stuck it into my glove, and <b>thought</b> no more <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a time, for the mob soon began to gather, to yell and threaten the prisoners, and my hands were too full, till we had got them safely on board a ship, to think any more of the matter.

5000|$|Frontman Steven Wilson {{described}} the album: [...] "Six {{of the songs}} are taken from singles that were released in 1999 and 2000. Sometimes tracks don't make it on to an album first time around not for reasons of quality (or lack of), but perhaps because they just didn't fit onto the album, or {{one member of the}} band wasn't happy with the track. Also perceptions can change and I think we all felt in hindsight that these six tracks deserved to be heard by a wider audience...The remaining 3 tracks we recorded specifically for the album. [...] "Oceans Have No Memory" [...] is a new band recording of a demo that was originally issued on the B-side of the [...] "Piano Lessons" [...] 7 -inch single. [...] "Access Denied" [...] was written and demoed for Lightbulb Sun but no one liked it except me! So I took the opportunity to re-present it to the band for inclusion on Recordings and this time they let me do it. Finally [...] "Buying New Soul" [...] was a song recorded during writing sessions just after Lightbulb Sun was finished. I think if it had been written a couple of months earlier it would have been included on the album. We <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> holding <b>it</b> back <b>for</b> the next album, but in the end we felt that because the next album {{is probably going to be}} moving into different musical waters it should be released now." ...|$|R

She {{certainly}} {{could not tell}} Lord Rufford {{to speak to the}} Duke without getting the Duke's leave to tell him so. And then, if all this were done, and Lord Rufford were to assure the Duke that the young lady had made a mistake, how derogatory would all that be to the exalted quiescence of the house of Mayfair!

He had been specially asked by Mr. Walker to be very civil. Only one could sit on the box with the driver, and if the request was conceded the poor policeman must walk back.

6000|$|The {{words were}} no sooner {{out of his}} mouth, than Mr. Glascock knew, and remembered, and felt what he had said. There are {{occasions}} in which a man sins so deeply against fitness and {{the circumstances of the}} hour, that it becomes impossible for him to slur over his sin as though it had not been committed. There are certain little peccadilloes in society which one can manage to throw behind one,--perhaps with some difficulty, and awkwardness; but still they are put aside, and conversation goes on, though with a hitch. But there are graver offences, the gravity of which strikes the offender so seriously that it becomes impossible for him to seem even to ignore his own iniquity. Ashes must be eaten publicly, and sackcloth worn before the eyes of men. It was so now with poor Mr. Glascock. He <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a moment,--whether or no it was possible that he should continue his remarks about the American ladies, without betraying his own consciousness of the thing that he had done; and he found that it was quite impossible. He knew that he was red up to his hairs, and hot, and that his blood tingled. His blushes, indeed, would not be seen in the seclusion of the banquette; but he could not overcome the heat and the tingling. There was silence for about three minutes, and then he felt that it would be best for him to confess his own fault. [...] "Trevelyan," [...] he said, [...] "I am very sorry for the allusion that I made. I ought to have been less awkward, and I beg your pardon." ...|$|E
50|$|The band kept up {{the high}} pace and went into a frenetic {{rehearsal}} mode In January {{to prepare for the}} recording of their second album, which peaked with a show at Copenhagen Jazzhouse where Afenginn presented new material. âAkrobakkusâ was recorded during February (read more about the recording here) and was released in April. The album was richly orchestrated and featured, among others, the cult actor Zlatko Buric as well as the gypsy cimbalon virtuoso George Mihalache. The basic tracks were recorded in Sweet Silence in Copenhagen, and after a week there the band moved on to the studio collective at Vibevej where Denmarkâs most famous guitarist Aske Jacoby also came and went as part of the collective. Meanwhile, the bass player, Andrzej Krejniuk, decided to focus on his studies at the conservatory and left the band, and at a hectic time the band started looking for a replacement for the rather demanding bass role. One day, Aske was hanging around in the studio and was asked whether he knew a good bass player. He promptly answered: âAsk me!â. They <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> went <b>for</b> the offer and welcomed Aske as a new Afenginn member in April 2006. âAkrobakkusâ got rave reviews and the band went on an extensive release tour visiting Denmark, Switzerland, Faroe Islands and Estonia. Later in the summer, they were invited to play festivals in Sweden and the big Dranouter Festival in Belgium. A big festival gig was a new experience for the relatively young band. It was a great success... until the power shut down. Fortunately, this happened in the sing-along part of âAndante Mobileâ, putting the band at work directing the audience from the stage until the power came back on. When this happened, the scream from the audience was overwhelming, sending the band into a moment of communal ecstasy. After the concert, Kim presented the other members with his ideas for the bandâs third album. This would be a concept album featuring the Finnish poet Timo Haapaniemiâs abstract syntax error poems in a home-made language, referred to as âstreet latinâ. This would be sung by a male choir and orchestrated for Afenginn, obviously, and a brass band. In November, the long anticipated movie âElgen kommerâ (âThe Moose comesâ) by Jacob Remin premiered in Filmhuset in Copenhagen with Afenginn responsible for the music and some of the hype surrounding this poor creature.

40|$|Senior {{consumers}} are {{a rapidly growing}} and highly heterogeneous part of the world's population. This group does not always meet its recommended protein intake, which can negatively impact on their physical functioning and quality of life. To date, {{little is known about}} their motivations to consume protein-rich meals. In the current study, we therefore aim to identify consumer segments within the group of vital community-dwelling older adults on the basis of mealtime functionality (for example âI eat because I'm hungryâ, or âI eat because it is cosyâ). To this end, we first conducted an online survey to identify these functional mealtime expectations of older consumers (study I, n = 398, 158 males, mean age 65. 8 (y) Â± 5. 9 (SD)). To obtain further insights regarding mealtime functionality and proteins/protein enrichment, laddering interviews were conducted with a subgroup of the segmentation study participants (study II, n = 40, 20 males, mean age 66. 9 (y) Â± 4. 8 (SD)). The results of the online survey showed three consumer clusters: cosy socialisers, physical nutritioners, and thoughtless rewarders. Thoughtless rewarders tend to eat without having explicit <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> they eat <b>for</b> the reward, and score highest on environmental awareness. Both the segmentation and the in-depth interviews showed that, for the cosy socialisers, the cosiness and social function of a meal are important motivators, whereas for the physical nutritioners the focus is more on the health and nutrient aspects of a meal. For cosy socialisers, protein enrichment can best be achieved through addition of protein-rich ingredients, whereas, for physical nutritioners, addition of protein powder is preferred. These results provide practical guidelines for the development of protein-rich meals and communication strategies tailored to the needs of specific vital community-dwelling older subgroups. </p...|$|R
