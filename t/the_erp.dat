The present study sought to provide insight into the cognitive processes that could be involved in overeating. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of 11 overweight and 12 normal-weight children were measured during completion of a Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) task. The N 2 and P 3 components of control participants??? ERPs were expected to show evidence of right-hemisphere processes involved in response-inhibition. Because specific deficiencies in these components are believed to be related to inefficient inhibitory control, it was predicted that <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> of overweight children would be characterized by decreased N 2 component amplitudes compared to <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> of normal-weight controls. For trials in which inhibition was successful, it was predicted that <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> of overweight children would be characterized by smaller P 3 amplitudes than <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> for normal-weight children.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the sensitivity of}} visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) to an abstract and non-semantic category, the vertical mirror symmetry. Event-related potentials were recorded to random and symmetric square patterns, delivered in passive oddball paradigm (participants played a video game). In one of the conditions, symmetric patterns were frequent (standard) stimuli and the random patterns were infrequent (deviant) stimuli, in the other condition the probabilities were reversed. We compared <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to symmetric stimuli as deviants and as standards, and similarly, <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to <b>the</b> random deviants and random standards. As the difference between <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to random deviant and random standard stimuli a posterior negativity emerged in two latency ranges (112 – 120 -ms and 284 – 292 -ms). These negativities were considered as visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) components. We suggest the two vMMN components are organized in cascade error signals. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to <b>the</b> symmetric deviants and symmetric standards. Emergence of vMMN to the deviant random stimuli is considered as a deviation of a perceptual category (in the symmetric standard’s sequence presented). Accordingly, random stimuli acquired no perceptual category, for this reason the symmetric deviant (in the random standard’s sequence presented) elicited no vMMN. The results show that the memory system underlying visual mismatch negativity is capable of coding perceptual categories such as bilateral symmetry, even if the stimulus patterns are unrelated to the ongoing behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the effects of response priming on <b>the</b> event-related potentials (<b>ERPs)</b> evoked by target stimuli in a go/nogo task. Methods: In each trial, subjects were presented a cue and a target stimulus. The cue informed subjects about the following target in that trial, and therefore, also about the kind of response (right-hand response, left-hand response, no overt response) potentially to be given in that trial. Results: The traditional N 2 and P 3 go/nogo effects were, replicated: <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to nogo targets were negative compared to <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> evoked by go, targets in the N 2 latency range at frontal electrode sites, and the nogo P 3 s were more anteriorly distributed than the go P 3 s. Comparing <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> evoked by nogo targets, we found the P 3, but not the N 2, to be modulated by response priming, Conclusions: These results seem to indicate that the P 3, but not the N 2, is associated with response inhibition, or with an evaluation/decision process with regard to the expected and/or given response. It could be speculated that the traditional go/nogo N 2 effect has to be explained in terms of response activation instead of response inhibition. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{interactions}} in neural processing of auditory and visual speech by recording event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Unisensory (auditory - A and visual - V) and audiovisual (AV) vowels {{were presented to}} 11 subjects. AV vowels were phonetically either congruent (e. g., acoustic /a/ and visual /a/) or incongruent (e. g., acoustic /a/ and visual /y/). ERPs to AV stimuli and the sum of <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to A and V stimuli (A+V) were compared. Similar ERPs to AV and A+V were hypothesized to indicate independent processing of A and V stimuli. Differences {{on the other hand}} would suggest AV interactions. Three deflections, the first peaking at about 85 ms after the A stimulus onset, were significantly larger in <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to A+V than in <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to both congruent and incongruent AV stimuli. We suggest that these differences reflect AV interactions in the processing of general, non-phonetic, features shared by the acoustic and visual stimulus (spatial location, coincidence in time). The first difference in <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> to incongruent and congruent AV vowels peaked at 155 ms from the A stimuli onset. This and two later differences are suggested to reflect interactions at phonetic level. The early general AV interactions probably reflect modified activity in the sensory-specific cortices, whereas the later phonetic AV interactions are likely generated in the heteromodal cortices. Thus, our results suggest that sensory-specific and heteromodal brain regions participate in AV speech integration at separate latencies and are sensitive to different features of A and V speech stimuli...|$|R

40|$|The {{originality}} of {{this study}} is to examine the processing of pitch and duration in music reading, using both electrophysiological and behavioral methods. Specifically, it was of interest to determine whether pitch and duration in music reading are processed independently or jointly.

A target note followed the probe and participants made a match/mismatch judgment on the dimension they were required to analyze (i. e. pitch or duration).

Results showed that early differences emerged in <b>the</b> <b>ERPs</b> as a function of the task to be performed on the target in block 1.
