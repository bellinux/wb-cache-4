5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> {{subsequently}} {{amended to}} promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United States and its allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control arrangements, and in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies.|$|E

5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The aim of <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>was</b> to improve the government's {{ability to deal with}} terrorism. It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. <b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>was</b> subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E

50|$|Further, {{the court}} decided <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> does {{not violate the}} Constitution's double {{jeopardy}} prohibition nor the ban on ex post-facto law because <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> does not establish criminal proceedings and therefore involuntary confinement under it is not punishment. Because <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> civil, Hendricks' confinement under <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> not a second prosecution nor is it double jeopardy. And finally, the court said <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> not considered punitive if it fails to offer treatment for an untreatable condition.|$|R

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> largely ineffective, it {{has been}} seen as the first piece of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to {{subsequent}} regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a legal requirement until the Factories Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|As {{almost all}} of the ACT's {{population}} lives in Canberra, political trends for both areas are closely aligned. <b>The</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>was</b> given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory. The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory. In 1974, <b>the</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>was</b> allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two. A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution.|$|E
5|$|As this {{statement}} was not true, Alvarez was indicted {{for violating the}} Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, {{the place where the}} trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.|$|E

5|$|In 1654, {{only five}} years after its passage, <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants {{following}} the execution of King Charles I of England and {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692.|$|E
5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. <b>The</b> <b>ACT</b> <b>was</b> {{the only other}} mainland territory, with a population {{greater than that of}} the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then it must also be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>was</b> {{a result}} of the stormy {{relationship}} between Aberhart and the press, which dated to before the 1935 election, in which the Social Credit League was elected to government. Virtually all of Alberta's newspapers—especially the Calgary Herald—were critical of Social Credit, as were a number of publications from elsewhere in Canada. Even the American media had greeted Aberhart's election with derision.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable {{in the case of}} stolen cultural property.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} issues {{considered}} by the High Court were whether the Migration Act 1958 (the legislation governing immigration to Australia) permitted a person in Al-Kateb's situation to be detained indefinitely, and if so, whether this was permissible under the Constitution of Australia. A majority of the court decided that the Act did allow indefinite detention, and that <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> not unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. <b>The</b> <b>act</b> <b>was,</b> however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
