2500|$|On a trip in Jerusalem, Rodriguez-Lopez {{purchased}} an archaic ouija-type talking {{board at}} a curio shop {{as a gift}} for Bixler-Zavala. They would return to their tour bus after shows to play with it during their 2006 tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as it quickly became the band's post-show ritual. Dubbed [...] "The Soothsayer", the board revealed stories, gave names and made demands, as the band was contacted by three different people who appeared in the form of one, who was then referred to as [...] "Goliath". The more the band interacted with [...] "The Soothsayer", otherworldly coincidences began plaguing the band's experience writing and recording The Bedlam in Goliath: Blake Fleming, their drummer at the time, quit mid-tour and left the band with financial troubles; Bixler-Zavala wound up needing surgery performed on his foot due to the shoes he had been wearing, forcing him to relearn how to walk post-surgery; audio tracks sporadically disappeared from the studio's harddrives; Rodriguez-Lopez's home studio flooded and was subject to multiple power outages; and the album's original engineer went through a nervous breakdown, leaving behind all previous work with no notes as to where anything was. The engineer who quit stated to Rodriguez-Lopez: [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> this record. You're trying to do something very bad with this record, you're trying to make me crazy and you're trying to make people crazy." ...|$|E

40|$|English. It {{involves}} {{a time of}} silent reflection during which students write their com-ments on the board prior to a class discussion, allowing students time to gather their thoughts and compose reflective comments. Brookfield wraps up this “conversation ” by sharing the challenges, risks, and mis-understandings he has experienced when implementing his critical thinking frame-work. He then relates these issues back to the theoretical foundation presented in the initial chapters and finishes with an admission of the assumptions he holds about teaching critical thinking. He states, “I know {{that no matter what}} the context, being able to think critically is crucial to your survival and <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> choices that are in your best interests ” (p. 259). These words serve as Brookfield’s powerful ratio-nale for overcoming the challenges of implementing his critical thinking framework into adult and higher education learning environments. Brookfield asserts that critical thinkers seek and evaluate relevant assumptions of a situation. Are there assumptions held by the author that affect the quality of this book? The first is an assumption that the reader accepts the importance and utility of teachin...|$|R
