5|$|The {{station is}} on an {{alignment}} of approximately 160 degrees, curving towards the south. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> -long platform which serves trains in both directions, situated {{on the east side}} of the track. The station's western platform was abandoned in 1970 and is overgrown. A user-worked level crossing at the north end of the station allows vehicles and pedestrians to cross the railway, alternatively pedestrians may cross the line using a footpath which goes under the bridge over the River Trym.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{rail link}} to the Rhondda, the Rhondda Line, based around the old Taff Vale Railway which {{serviced}} both the Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr. The Rhondda Line runs through the Rhondda Fawr, linking Rhondda to Cardiff Central. The railway stations that once populated the Rhondda Fach were all closed after the Beeching Axe. The railway line serves ten Rhondda stations with the villages not directly linked connected through bus services.|$|E
5|$|Gynoecium : Superior ovary (hypogynous), syncarpous (with fused carpels), {{with three}} connate (fused) carpels and is trilocular (three locules, or chambers) or unilocular (single locule, as in Scoliopus and Medeola). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata {{more or less}} {{elongated}} along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria). Embryo sacs in which {{three of the four}} megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus, are referred to as Fritillaria-type, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{school in}} the neighbourhood, Prince Rupert Elementary School, {{operated}} by the Edmonton Public School System, however, since it closed after the 1994-1995 school year, <b>there</b> has not <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{school in the}} neighbourhood.|$|R

5|$|Small rodents {{form the}} largest {{part of the}} least weasel's diet, but it also kills and eats rabbits, other mammals, and {{occasionally}} birds, birds' eggs, fish and frogs. Males mark their territories with olfactory signals and have exclusive home ranges which may intersect with or include several female ranges. Least weasels use pre-existing holes to sleep, store food and raise their young. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and summer, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> litter of about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female. Due to its small size and fierce nature, the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has an almost circumglobal range in {{tropical}} and warm-temperature waters, {{consisting of a}} number of widely separated populations with likely little interchange between them. This shark has not been reported from the eastern Pacific and northern Indian Oceans. In the northern Atlantic, it occurs in the Georges Bank and the northern Gulf of Mexico, and from the North Sea to Cameroon, including around the British Isles, in the western and central Mediterranean Sea, and off Madeira and the Azores. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa and Mozambique. In the Pacific, it occurs off Japan, Java, Australia and New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> record of this species in the southern Atlantic, from off southern Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the finless sleeper ray extends from the eastern Andaman Sea, near {{southern}} border between Thailand and Myanmar, through the Strait of Malacca to Singapore, and northward to Vietnam. Its exact distribution off Thailand is uncertain. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> record of this species from Sarawak in Borneo. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits fine sediment habitat over the continental shelf in both inshore and offshore waters. In the 19th century, it was reportedly abundant year-round in the Straits of Malacca. It is locally common in some areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{terminal}} {{consists of}} a single building, with an integrated control tower, capable of handling 120passengers per hour. The facade is covered in Russian larch; the focus on wood as a dominant material was common for Norwegian architecture the 1990s, and is also seen at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (opened in 1998) and for the venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The terminal was designed by Alta-based architect Solveig Thorsen and is shaped like an aircraft wing, similar to the terminal building at Gardermoen. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> gate at the airport, which prior to the installation of security control was 17steps from the entrance.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} approaches to co-educational Scouting. Countries such as the United States have maintained separate Scouting organizations for boys and girls. In other countries, especially within Europe, Scouting and Guiding have merged, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> organization for boys and girls, which {{is a member of}} both the WOSM and the WAGGGS. In others, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls, but is only a member of the WOSM, while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS. In some countries like Greece, Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations of Scouts (members of WOSM) and guides (members of WAGGGS), both admitting boys and girls.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale {{of many of the}} paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, so that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.|$|E
50|$|From 1832 to 1885 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Aberdeen constituency. Prior to 1832, the burgh of Aberdeen had <b>been</b> {{represented}} as <b>a</b> {{component of the}} Aberdeen Burghs constituency.|$|R

5|$|In {{mapping the}} {{distribution}} of Mari Lwyd appearances, Cawte noted that it was principally a custom associated with Glamorgan, with two-thirds of instances falling within that county. The custom stretched east into the industrial valleys of Monmouthshire, with the most easterly account coming from Monmouth itself; this account {{is also one of}} the earliest. A number of examples were also found in Carmarthenshire, with a single example found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> record of the custom being performed in North Wales, in an example from Wrexham, which Cawte believed was the result of a Glamorgan man bringing the custom with him as he moved north. Previously, Peate had cautioned that the comparative absence of recorded examples from Mid and North Wales was not proof that the Mari Lwyd custom had never been present in those areas.|$|E
5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when {{it is necessary to}} enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E
5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E
