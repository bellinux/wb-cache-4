40|$|Abstract. A <b>tether</b> <b>satellite’s</b> {{behavior}} {{about the}} collinear {{points of the}} circular-restricted three-body problem is analyzed systematically for inert tethers. The dumbbell model, which {{is assumed to be}} applicable for tethers in fast rotation, is addressed. The known periodic solutions that are modified in the case of <b>tether</b> <b>satellites</b> are discussed with a focus on the Hill problem. A conspicuous configuration is found for tethers rotating parallel to the plane of the primaries, a case in which the attitude of the <b>tether</b> <b>satellite</b> remains constant on average, and it is demonstrated that either lengthening or shortening the tether may lead to orbit stability. Promising results are found for orbits of the vertical family, but regions of stability are also found in the case of halo orbits...|$|R

40|$|Tethered {{spacecraft}} {{are particularly}} {{well suited to}} serve as isolation platforms for space-borne observatories. It has previously been shown that, due to the relatively large tether force, conventional means of performing attitude control for <b>tethered</b> <b>satellites</b> are inefficient for any mission with pointing requirements more stringent than about 1 deg. A particularly effective method of implementing attitude control for <b>tethered</b> <b>satellites</b> {{is to use the}} tether tension force to generate control moments by moving the tether attach point relative to the subsatellite center of mass. This paper presents the development of a precision pointing control algorithm for <b>tethered</b> <b>satellites</b> and the simulation of the control system with laboratory hardware. The control algorithm consists of a linear quadratic regulator feedback law and a Kalman filter. The control algorithm has been shown to regulate the vehicle orientation to within 0. 60 arcsec rms. This level of precision was achieved only after including a mass center estimator and accurately modeling the effects of the nonlinear attach point motion actuator...|$|R

40|$|Tethered {{spacecraft}} possess unique {{dynamic characteristics}} which make them advantageous for certain classes of experiments. One use for which tethers are particularly well suited {{is to provide}} an isolated platform for spaceborne observatories. The advantages of tethering a pointing platform 1 or 2 km from a space shuttle or space station are that, compared to placing the observatory on the parent spacecraft, vibrational disturbances are attenuated and contamination is eliminated. In practice, all satellites have some requirement on the attitude control of the spacecraft, and <b>tethered</b> <b>satellites</b> are no exception. It has previously been shown that conventional means of performing attitude control for <b>tethered</b> <b>satellites</b> are insufficient for any mission with pointing requirements more stringent than about 1 deg. This is due mainly to the relatively large force applied by the tether to the spacecraft. A particularly effective method of implementing attitude control for <b>tethered</b> <b>satellites</b> is to use this tether tension force to generate control torques by moving the tether attach point relative to the subsatellite center of mass. A demonstration of this attitude control technique on an astrophysical pointing platform has been proposed for a space shuttle flight test project and {{is referred to as}} the Kinetic Isolation Tether Experiment (KITE) ...|$|R

50|$|Electrodynamic tethers (EDTs) {{are long}} {{conducting}} wires, {{such as one}} deployed from a <b>tether</b> <b>satellite,</b> which can operate on electromagnetic principles as generators, by converting their kinetic energy to electrical energy, or as motors, converting electrical energy to kinetic energy. Electric potential is generated across a conductive tether by its motion through a planet's magnetic field.|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} {{method is}} analytically shown for multiplying {{the number of}} orbital slots for synchronous satellites. This is by radially <b>tethering</b> <b>satellites</b> above the synchronous orbit (forces outwards) balanced to satellites below this orbit (forces inwards). The term practical applies because the tether tension force is of second order smallness. Thus, several thousand miles of synchronous satellites can be radiated along a small tether line sized for tension of about one percent of a satellite weight. A vertical tether line also provides a track for transport, that is, a ladder or elevator. Analysis for an optimized diameter tether line is developed which is particularly effective when the tether, line is extended to the ground, thus, making a space ladder. Mars is the best candidate for a space ladder. With the optimized tether the total system mass is minimum when the outer satellite is far out. <b>Tethered</b> <b>satellites</b> have G-forces...|$|R
