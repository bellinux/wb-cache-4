Scrushy and Seigelman vowed to appeal their convictions and sentences, while the prosecution announced its desire to appeal a judge's decision to remove charges of perjury from Scrushy's indictment. <b>The</b> <b>prosecutors</b> quickly dropped their appeal, and United States Attorney Alice Martin indicated they had reconsidered.|$|E

5|$|As {{the crime}} {{involved}} {{more than one}} victim, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutors</b> decided to request the death penalty when the case went to trial.

50|$|Prosecutors are {{involved}} in the whole trial process, from the investigations, to trial proceedings and the execution of punishment. At the investigation stage, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> supervises <b>the</b> police’s investigations. <b>The</b> <b>prosecutor</b> only personally investigates cases when there are special crimes, such as corruption. Once the police complete investigations, they hand the evidence to <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> If <b>the</b> evidence is satisfactory, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> will prosecute <b>the</b> offender at an appropriate court. He will prepare a Bill of Indictment for the judge to begin the trial proceedings. During the trial proceedings, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> must ensure that the defendant, witnesses and experts are all present. <b>The</b> <b>prosecutor</b> must also present all evidence concerning the crime. In practice, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> usually presents three or more pieces of legal evidence to support the defendant’s guilt. After the judge has passed judgment on the case, the judge’s clerk will send a copy of the execution of punishment to <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>prosecutor</b> will then execute the punishment.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, Molly Kronberg, {{widow of}} Kenneth Kronberg, sued LaRouche {{in federal court}} for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, alleging {{that he and his}} {{associates}} libelled and harassed her on account of her compelled testimony in the 1988 case which led to his conviction. LaRouche alleges that Kronberg perjured herself and colluded with <b>the</b> <b>prosecutors</b> to frame him in order to cover up a bad check issued in 1979 by her from a New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company account for royalties owed him. One of <b>the</b> <b>prosecutors</b> in the 1988 case, John Markham, is representing Kronberg in the suit.|$|E
5|$|In {{sentencing}} Lawrence, {{the judges}} {{found no evidence}} to support her claim that her life was threatened and although <b>the</b> <b>prosecutors</b> requested a lighter 20-year sentence due to her early cooperation with police, the judges sentenced her to life imprisonment. On the next day, the remaining three defendants, Chen, Nguyen and Norman, were sentenced to life imprisonment as well. On 24 January 2006, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutors</b> demanded the death penalty for Sukumaran, this being {{the first time that a}} demand of death was put forward for any of the Bali Nine. They told the Bali court that there was no reason to show any leniency to the 24-year-old, because he helped organize the heroin smuggling operation. <b>The</b> <b>prosecutors</b> also claim that it was Sukumaran who strapped heroin to the bodies of his fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players, in what they said to be a major smuggling ring. On 26 January, it was also recommended that Andrew Chan receive the death penalty.|$|E

40|$|Article 112, section 4 of the Rome Statute {{empowers}} the Assembly {{to establish}} "such subsidiary bodies {{as may be}} necessary, including an independent oversight mechanism for inspection, evaluation and investigation of the Court, {{in order to enhance}} its efficiency and economy. " Recent proposals to establish an Independent Oversight Mechanism with powers to investigate alleged misconduct of staff members of the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> have provoked controversies between <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office and <b>the</b> Assembly of States. The major bone of contention has been whether the IOM should have the power to start investigations into the misconduct of staff members of the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor,</b> without prior authorization of <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office has vigorously defended the need for such prior authorization. The demand of <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> is primarily fueled by the fear that investigations might interfere with <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office independence. <b>The</b> latest Draft Resolution of the Assembly of States parties, though more forthcoming towards <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor’s</b> qualms, does not fully accommodate the latter’s wish that his authorization is required before an investigation can proceed. The present author, however, agrees with <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> that <b>the</b> requirement of prior authorization fits the current system of dual accountability: staff members are accountable to <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> is accountable to the Assembly of States Parties. If <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> were to obstruct unreasonably investigations by the IOM, his accountability towards the ASP could come into question. In this way, the Assembly can exercise control over a Prosecutor who is adamant to co-operate with an investigation into well-founded allegations...|$|R

5|$|In his roles at the ICTY and ICTR he had {{to design}} prosecutorial {{strategies}} for both those ground-breaking tribunals, from scratch.

5|$|Piso {{was rumored}} to have been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep anger toward Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than <b>the</b> <b>prosecutors,</b> but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|E

5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing problems for <b>the</b> <b>prosecutors</b> as {{an increasing number}} of the counts were meeting their statutes of limitations.

The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E
