Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> of his food.

5|$|Because of the Pandavas' ruined {{financial}} state, Balarama's wife, Revati, {{refuses to}} honour {{her commitment to}} marry Sasirekha and Abhimanyu and expresses her support for the alliance with the Kauravas. Krishna, who is aware of Duryodhana and Shakuni's real intentions, orders his charioteer Daaruka to take Subhadra and Abhimanyu through the forests to Ghatotkacha hermitage. Ghatotkacha, {{who happens to be}} Abhimanyu's brother, at first thinks they are intruders in his forest and attacks them but later apologises for the misunderstanding. When Subhadra explains the change in the marriage arrangements, Ghatotkacha decides to wage war against both the Kauravas and Balarama. At the urging of his mother, Hidimbi, and Subhadra, Ghatotkacha abandons his plans and is advised instead <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> trickery in Dvaraka. With the knowledge of Krishna and Sasirekha's servant, he carries the sleeping Sasirekha in her bed from Dvaraka, and flies to his hermitage. Assuming Sasirekha's form, he returns to Dvaraka and, {{with the help of his}} assistants Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, wreaks havoc on her wedding to Lakshmana Kumara, preventing the marriage from being carried out.|$|E
5|$|Rainie {{returns to}} Walford in 2010 and tells Max she {{is clean and}} sober, and asks Max for Tanya's phone number. Tanya's daughter, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), wants Rainie to stay and Max agrees. She steals money out of Max's sister Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) purse, which she uses to buy crack cocaine. Max catches her with the drugs and throws her out.

George agreed <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> songs {{with the band}} again, resulting in recording sessions and producing {{more than a dozen}} songs that are still unreleased to this day. George, however, was more excited about his future projects like his record label, More Protein, and his new acid house project Jesus Loves You. The proposed reunion ended up being cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{his college}} years, {{probably}} {{during the spring}} of 1854 while Ludlow was still at Princeton, his medical curiosity drew him to visit his “friend Anderson the apothecary” regularly. During these visits, Ludlow “made upon myself the trial of the effects of every strange drug and chemical which the laboratory could produce.” A few months before, Bayard Taylor’s Putnam’s Magazine article The Vision of Hasheesh had been devoured by Ludlow, and so when the cannabis-based tetanus remedy called Tilden’s extract came out he had <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some.</b>|$|E
25|$|Christopher Eccleston {{discussed}} {{plans for}} the anniversary episode with Moffat, but eventually declined to return as the Ninth Doctor. Sylvester McCoy, who played the Seventh Doctor, claimed {{that none of the}} surviving actors who portrayed the Doctor prior to Eccleston were contacted regarding the special. Colin Baker confirmed this while being interviewed on Australian television alongside McCoy and Paul McGann. However, McGann {{went on to say that}} he could still be in the 50th but at the last moment. Radio Times reported rumours that a Doctor from the classic era (pre-2005) would feature in the special, citing unknown sources. Freema Agyeman and John Barrowman, who played Tenth Doctor companions Martha Jones and Jack Harkness, respectively, both stated they would not be in the 50th, but may return to the show at some point. Barrowman stated that he would have liked to be in it, but speculated that the producers wanted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> different things.|$|E

She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
2500|$|Henning {{was willing}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> new things to spur {{business}} for the opera house. [...] He transformed the front part of the basement into a restaurant and saloon and even built an -long bowling alley. [...] In 1891 the saloon {{was turned into a}} tea room offering ice cream, cold lunches, and lemonade, which Henning's wife and daughters staffed. Henning also tried {{to improve the quality of}} theatrical circuits that came to perform at the opera house, but frequent cancelations and financial difficulties once again threatened to close Tibbits.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{legal experts}} {{have said that}} the United States could be obligated <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> of its {{soldiers}} for war crimes. Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a [...] "grave breach". In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army's provost marshal, Maj. Gen. Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.|$|E

2500|$|According to Richard W. Hurd, {{the history}} of the {{organizing}} model in the U.S. began from the failure of a [...] "labor law" [...] to be passed in the 1970s. In addition, Hurd explains that the 1980s were a very troubling time for unions in the U.S. as a result of [...] "...the anti-union reign of Ronald Reagan..." [...] and [...] "Twin recessions." [...] Both of these factors contributed to the decline of union membership that so infamously characterized the labor movement in the U.S. in the 1980s. In fact, Hurd says that, [...] "The labor movement lost more than one-fifth of its private sector members {{during the first half of}} the 1980s." [...] Therefore, U.S. unions were forced <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> new tactics in the hopes of regaining the membership they were losing.|$|E
2500|$|About.com {{felt that}} Jay-Z lacked presence, writing, [...] "It looks like someone finally {{got tired of}} being bullied by 'Big Brother'. Roc Nation dropped {{the ball on the}} song credit though; it was {{supposed}} to read 'Kanye West Featuring Rihanna,' because 'Ye murdered Jay on his own track. But that's not saying much because Jay was running this race on one foot. In other words, Kanye didn't win, Jay lost". Digital Spy gave a mixed review of the song. [...] "Boasting three of the biggest stars from the worlds of hip-hop and R, 'Run This Town' {{was never going to be}} a flop, but neither is it a roaring success. Kanye's slick rapping ("Reebok baby, you need <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> new things, have you ever had shoes without shoestrings?") and Rihanna's [...] "hey-hey" [...] chorus hook make Jay-Z seem surplus to requirements, which surely can't have been the aim. The chaotic military march beats are impressive – and hats off to Jigga for snubbing Auto-Tune – but this track still doesn't seem fitting of an artist considered a groundbreaking rap legend.|$|E
2500|$|Paxton decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>some</b> more {{elaborate}} recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, {{as well as}} his acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. [...] Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with The Things I Notice Now in the summer of 1969, and also charted with Tom Paxton 6 in the spring of the following year. [...] His song [...] "Whose Garden Was This", an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver's 1970 album. [...] The diverse [...] "Baroque Folk" [...] experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. [...] Regarding this time, he said, [...] "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most... I know I didn't have that rock mentality or anything. [...] I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma. [...] And I just wanted to hear folk songs." [...] Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.|$|E
