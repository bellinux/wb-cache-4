500|$|Cooper {{comments}} {{of this period}} of David's life, [...] "Pictures of her at the time show a quintessential librarian, dressed in a dark cardigan over a white shirt with a prim little collar buttoned up to the neck: but at night, dressed in exotic spangled caftans, she was a different creature: drinking at Hedjaki's bar, eating at the P'tit Coin de France, dancing {{on the roof of}} the Continental and then going on to Madame Badia's nightclub or the glamorous Auberge des Pyramides." [...] In her years in Cairo, David had a number of affairs. She enjoyed <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were, but only once fell in love. That was with a young officer, Peter Laing, but the relationship came to an end when he was seriously wounded and he returned to his native Canada. Several other of her young men fell in love with her; one of them was Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony David (1911–1967). By now aged thirty, she weighed the advantages and disadvantages of remaining unmarried until such time as the ideal husband might appear, and with considerable misgivings she finally accepted Tony David's proposal of marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Thompson's most {{influential}} work was and remains The Making of the English Working Class, published in 1963 {{while he was}} working at the University of Leeds. The massive book, over 800 pages, was a watershed in the foundation of the field of social history. By exploring the ordinary cultures of working people through their previously ignored documentary remains, Thompson told the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. [...] Reflecting on the importance of the book for its 50th anniversary, Emma Griffin explained that Thompson [...] "uncovered details about workshop customs and rituals, failed conspiracies, threatening letters, popular songs, and union club cards. He took what others had regarded as scraps from the archive and interrogated <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> told us about the beliefs and aims of those who were not on the winning side. Here, then, was a book that rambled over aspects of human experience that had never before had their historian.|$|E
