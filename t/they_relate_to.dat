5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language {{in terms of the}} concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

Autocrat in particular addresses philosophical issues such as the nature of one's self, language, life and truth.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl in the way that <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> their grandparents.|$|E
