5|$|Adjacent to {{the main}} station is , <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the South Eastern main line towards London before the {{terminus}} at Charing Cross. Waterloo East has four platforms, which are lettered A–D rather than numbered to avoid confusion with the numbered platforms in the main station by staff who work at both stations. Waterloo East is managed and branded separately from the main station. Trains go to southeast London, Kent and parts of East Sussex. All regular services are operated by Southeastern.|$|E
5|$|After six weeks' {{training}} in the capital, the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914. During its stopover in Bulawayo, it paraded in front of about 90% of the town's population; Plumtree, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> before crossing the border, provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet. Notwithstanding these grand farewells, the Maritz Rebellion was all but over {{by the time the}} Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at Bloemfontein. The vast majority of South African troops, including most of Boer origin, had remained loyal to the Union government, and the uprising had been quashed. The Rhodesians garrisoned Bloemfontein for about a month, then redeployed to Cape Town, where they underwent further training for the South-West Africa Campaign as part of South Africa's Northern Force, which Botha personally commanded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E

50|$|The manor {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> for <b>the</b> Underground Railroad before {{entering}} into Canada. There are still tunnels under the manor {{that lead to the}} nearby river. There have been reported sightings of an African American spirit near the manor.|$|R
5|$|At Carroll Street, {{the express}} tracks ramp up {{to rejoin the}} local tracks, and all four tracks rise onto the Culver Viaduct, curving onto Ninth Street. East of Fourth Avenue station towards Park Slope, the tracks become a subway once again. Past 7th Avenue, the local tracks diverge, curving south to 15th Street and Prospect Park West, while the express tracks take a direct route beneath Prospect Park. This {{is one of two}} places in the subway where the express tracks diverge from the local tracks, the other being on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between 65th Street and 36th Street. The express tracks rejoin the {{right-of-way}} at approximately Terrace Place and Prospect Avenue, running on a lower level under Prospect Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway near the Prospect Park Parade Grounds, then rise up as the line curves onto McDonald Avenue. The line then parallels the route of the original Culver Line surface railroad into Church Avenue station, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> of the original IND service.|$|E

25|$|After North White Plains, {{the next}} station is Valhalla {{adjacent}} to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the Saw Mill River Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at Mount Kisco, but then remain close by at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> along the Saw Mill, Bedford Hills (although the parkway cannot {{be seen from the}} station).|$|E
50|$|Buses run direct between Banbasa and Delhi, Agra, Bareilly, Rudrapur, Nanital, Haldwani, Dehradun, Haridwar, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Shimla {{and many}} other places.

Banbasa is one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> before <b>the</b> Himalayan mountain climb begins {{on the road to}} Almorah, Champawat and Pithoragarh.|$|R
50|$|Council Grove {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> on <b>the</b> Santa Fe Trail heading southwest. The first European-American settler was Seth Millington Hays, {{who came}} to the area in 1847 to trade with the Kaw tribe, which had a {{reservation}} established in the area in 1846. Hays was a great grandson of Daniel Boone.|$|R
5000|$|Childow Proclamation Train Sculpture 2004 - to {{mark the}} 175th anniversary of Western Australia and Proclamation Day 2004.

25|$|The Roman bathhouse {{consisted}} of three areas, the caldarium, the tepidarium, and the frigidarium. It also had a very impressive dome which is still in good condition today despite {{thousands of years of}} earthquakes and wars. The caldarium had vaulted ceilings, raised floors, and channels in the walls to conduct heat. The tepidarium had mosaic floors and frescoes just like the living quarters of the palace. The frigidarium, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> in the bathhouse, was where guests would cool off in a large pool.|$|E
25|$|The {{next two}} stops, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, are roughly eight miles (13km) apart, the longest {{distance}} between any two {{stops on the}} Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era {{that had not yet}} been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to Tenmile River and its new northern terminus, Wassaic. A small yard where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.|$|E
25|$|When {{domestic}} air routes {{were established}} in 1935, there only went months from the approval to the services commenced. Permission was granted in April, at which time a suitable site for an aerodrome {{had yet to be}} identified. As an interim solution a buoy was founded for the first season. Norwegian Air Lines set up Tromsø as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on its coastal service north of Bergen. Using a Junkers W 34, the route was inaugurated on 7 July and ran three times weekly for four weeks in the first season. Travel time to Bergen was ten and a half hours.|$|E

50|$|The {{village was}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stopping</b> point for many cattle drovers taking their {{livestock}} {{for sale in}} London. The drovers stayed in the local inns (such as the Red Cow) while the cattle were safely secured overnight in holding pens. Most of the villagers were agricultural or horticultural workers but with the early growth of the suburbs an increasing number worked in the brick industry that exploited the local London Clay.|$|R

25|$|Though Riccarton Road {{was part}} of the route, the first stop for {{outbound}} services and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> for inbound services were in Picton Avenue meaning there was no connection with the Riccarton tramline. This issue became moot on 1 August 1960 when a route alteration diverted Wharenui buses down Deans Avenue and Blenheim Road before rejoining the old route. There were many changes to the route over the next three decades including extensions that took it well beyond Wharenui. New destinations included Curletts Road and Springs Road and after the route ended up connecting with Hornby Mall in the 1980s it was combined with existing Templeton, Lincoln, and Southbridge routes.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, Madison {{served as}} a center of the Union Army in Wisconsin. The {{intersection}} of Milwaukee, East Washington, Winnebago, and North Streets is known as Union Corners, because a tavern there was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> for Union soldiers before heading to fight the Confederates. Camp Randall, {{on the west side}} of Madison, was built and used as a training camp, a military hospital, and a prison camp for captured Confederate soldiers. After the war ended, the Camp Randall site was absorbed into the University of Wisconsin and Camp Randall Stadium was built there in 1917. In 2004 the last vestige of active military training on the site was removed when the stadium renovation replaced a firing range used for ROTC training.|$|E
25|$|When American {{emigration}} {{over the}} Oregon Trail {{began in earnest}} in the early 1840s, for many settlers the fort became <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the Oregon Trail where they could get supplies, aid and help before starting their homestead. Fort Vancouver was the main re-supply point for nearly all Oregon trail travelers until U.S. towns could be established. The HBC established Fort Colvile in 1825 on the Columbia River near Kettle Falls as a good site to collect furs and control the upper Columbia River fur trade. Fort Nisqually was built near the present town of DuPont, Washington {{and was the first}} HBC fort on Puget Sound. Fort Victoria was erected in 1843 and became the headquarters of operations in British Columbia, eventually growing into modern-day Victoria, the capital city of British Columbia.|$|E

25|$|Thornfield, {{the estate}} of famed {{abolitionist}} and Quaker Thomas Garrett, lies on Garrett Road (named for his family, who were among the earliest settlers of {{that part of the}} township) and Maple Avenue in Drexel Hill. Garrett resided here before 1822 and would later work as a station master in Wilmington, Delaware, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the Underground Railroad. In 1956, the Thornfield estate was purchased by Caroline and Walter Isard, active Quakers who moved to the area when Walter founded the Regional Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. Caroline went on to found the Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia together with other concerned citizens in the area. As of 2014, the estate is owned by Randi T. Rioux. It is currently undergoing restoration, along with renovations necessary to preserve its history and allow for modern capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The line's cost totaled $715.3 million, with $334.3 million {{coming from}} the federal government. This is {{considerably}} higher than initial budgets predictedthe figure was about $400 million in 1997. Opponents to the rail line state that it went far over-budget, but supporters of the line state that extensions of the route and other alterations, plus the impact of inflation, are the real reasons for the increased cost. Initial designs cut out <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> in downtown, and {{the southern end of}} the line did not quite connect to the Mall of America. The Warehouse District stop was added early but another cost increase came from approximately $40 million to enhance the line (while construction was in progress) to bring the line directly into the Mall of America's transit hub. It was completed later than what was initially hoped for (a lot of literature points to 2003 as the opening year), but the mall connection was a significant contribution to the extra time requirements. These extensions are also why the line was initially reported to be 11.6 miles long, but ended up being 12 miles in length. The Target Field extension in 2009 added a few more tenths to the length.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Simpson asks Poirot {{to help in}} the {{investigation}} of a painting by Rubens which was stolen from the gallery that he owns. A group of unemployed men were paid to carry out a demonstration in the gallery which, once it was cleared by the police, was found to have been a diversion to enable the picture to be cut out of its frame. Simpson knows the picture is being transported to France where it will be bought by a millionaire collector and he wants Poirot to assist as he thinks he will be better at dealing with an unscrupulous rich man than the police will be. Poirot reluctantly agrees to help. He is far more interested in a case that Japp has about Winnie King, a fifteen-year-old English girl who was being escorted to Paris as one of a party of such girls for the new term at Miss Pope's exclusive school there. On the way back from the dining car of the train, just after it left Amiens (<b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> before Paris), Winnie King went into the toilet and seemingly vanished. No body has been found {{by the side of the}} tracks and the train made no other stops, only slowing down for a signal; however, Winnie's hat was later recovered near the tracks. Poirot asks if her shoes have been found.|$|E
