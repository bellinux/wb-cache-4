5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>of</b> Guayana, General Manuel Piar fights {{against the}} realists {{to seize the}} {{missions}} {{of the kingdom of}} Spain. After releasing Tumeremo, the Spanish survivors were imprisoned and sentenced to death. From there, the city was a strategic site and barracks for the patriot soldiers commanded by Simón Bolívar.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>of</b> William Wallace {{acts as a}} {{tutorial}} campaign, {{much like}} the original Age of Empires game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which in this Campaign is presented as the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander Edward Longshanks.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England, Pantulf held {{lands in}} Shropshire from Earl Roger de Montgomery. The earl settled {{a number of}} his Norman vassals, {{including}} Pantulf, on his new lands in Sussex and Shropshire. Pantulf was probably not present at the Battle of Hastings, likely due to Earl Roger's lack of participation in <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>of</b> conquest. Pantulf's grants totalled eleven manors located in Hodnet Hundred. Pantulf's lands in England were centered on Wem, and are considered a feudal barony, making Pantulf the first Baron of Wem. Although he had substantial lands in England, Pantulf continued to spend most of his time on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>of</b> 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle {{prior to the}} Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E

5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages of time and <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>of</b> destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party {{to support}} the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican in opposition to <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>of</b> the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Chamakh was {{pursued by}} several {{professional}} clubs {{that wanted to}} obtain his services. He drew interest from Lens, Toulouse, Lorient, and Bordeaux. Chamakh eventually decided to sign with Bordeaux due to the club's infrastructure and training facilities and {{also because of the}} close proximity to his family. Upon his arrival, Chamakh was placed into the club's youth academy. For the 2001–02 season, he was promoted to the club's Championnat de France amateur 2 team in the fifth division. Chamakh was involved heavily in <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>of</b> the team, coached by Jean-Louis Garcia. He appeared in 17 matches and scored six goals as the team finished first in their group, thus earning promotion to the Championnat de France amateur.|$|E

5|$|In each {{of these}} assignments, Hotze proved himself as a {{confident}} and courageous general against the stronger French Army of the Moselle. In recognition, {{he was promoted to}} Feldmarschall-leutnant, a rank unusual for a man from a non-aristocratic family. He was also raised to the rank of baron (Freiherr) by Emperor Francis II. In <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>of</b> 1795, he served again under the command of Wurmser; his troops secured Rhineland positions near Mannheim, and later took part in engagements at Edighofen and Kaiserslautern.|$|E
5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would have joined the clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded from doing so by his wife, who was a Campbell, and his neighbors. His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by the Campbell Earl of Breadalbane. Nonetheless, many MacIntyres were in the clan regiment of Stewart of Appin in <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>of</b> 1745–46, but they did not serve as an independent body.|$|E
5|$|Japanese losses {{during the}} {{campaign}} amounted to a significantly higher total {{than those of the}} Allies, although exact numbers have not been established. About 12,500Japanese soldiers participated in the campaign and about 5,500are believed to have been killed. Some sources indicate a possibly higher toll. With only 4,300 Japanese reaching Sio {{at the end of the}} campaign, it is possible that the figure is closer to 7,000 or 8,000. A significant amount of war materiel was also lost during <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> <b>Of</b> the 26 field artillery pieces that the Japanese possessed in the region, 18 were captured by the Australians {{during the campaign}}, while 28 out of their 36 heavy machine-guns were also lost.|$|E
