25|$|Mrs Sharona Melly (Carole Boyd) - The bossy, bad-tempered <b>Tourist</b> <b>Information</b> <b>officer</b> from Series 9. She {{was also}} nicknamed 'Mrs Smelly' and 'Smelly Melly', {{due to her}} {{forename}} beginning with 'S', and appearing as 'Mrs S Melly'. She is highly suspicious of Bodger and believes that he is hiding something in his hotel, although she never actually finds out about Badger. She refuses to recommend Bodger's hotel to tourists because he accidentally covered her in mashed potato when she visited his B & B. She dislikes people having fun on the beach outside her office and {{will do anything to}} prevent it. She has a lot of trouble with China the dog, who is always hanging around her office. She often looks for quick ways to make money, such as when she attempts to catch a valuable bird and charge people to see it, and when she believes Bodger has won the lottery she buys him lunch and starts being nice to him in the hope that he will share some of his winnings with her.|$|E
25|$|A format {{change from}} series 5 begun {{to show the}} two at home rather than Bodger's {{workplace}} (although Bodger's home also became his workplace in series 8 & 9 which were set in a B hotel run by Mr. Bodger). Series 5 to 7 rarely - if ever - mentioned Mr Bodger's employment, suggesting this was a period where he was unemployed, although it is mentioned in Series 7 that he works as an odd-job man for his landlady. These series still focused on Bodger's attempts to hide Badger from figures of authority (his landlady from Series 5 to 7 then the <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> <b>officer</b> in series 9. This was presumably for health and safety reasons - a badger would constitute a hygiene and safety risk). They also began to feature less of Bodger, concentrating more on Badger and his friend Mousey. She was a well-meaning but dim-witted mouse, who had a fondness for cheese. These later episodes increased the slapstick humour from the earlier episodes and additionally featured prominent comedic sound effects and incidental music, which were largely absent from the first two series but gradually increased in prominence throughout series three and four. However the early episodes mostly featured Bodger and Badger doing some activity in a sped-up sequence, this largely died out around the time the music and sound effects increased in prominence.|$|E
2500|$|Series 9 {{continued}} with {{the setting of}} series 8, with Bodger still running his hotel with Badger and (unwittingly) Mousey in tow. In this series the character of Mrs Melly was introduced, the bossy <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> <b>officer</b> who stopped people from having fun on the beach outside her office. She hated Bodger and refused to recommend his B to tourists although she was kind to him in one episode - [...] "Hundreds And Thousands".|$|E
40|$|Local {{destinations}} incorporate various stakeholders, often {{including a}} host community, and can form a network with other destinations to shape larger destinations. To attract tourists, destinations {{must consider the}} travel basic costs, convenience, and timelines. Like other consumers, tourists weigh costs against the benefits of specific destinations and investment of time, effort, and resources against a reasonable return in education, experience, fun, relaxation, and memories. Convenience takes various meanings in travel decisions: time involved in travel from airport to lodging, language barriers, cleanliness and sanitary concerns, access to interests (beaches, attractions, amenities) and special needs (Kotler, 2002). <b>Tourist</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Officers</b> are our front line in all tourism matters, along with Travel Consultants and with the front-desk personnel of other tourism stakeholders.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} assumptions {{have been}} discussed and many theories have been developed {{in the study of}} modern tourism since the dawn of the 19 th Century, there is insufficient research in the field of <b>tourist</b> <b>information,</b> {{in spite of the fact}} that <b>tourist</b> <b>information,</b> in particular, message delivery systems through languages, has been playing an essential role in generating tourism phenomena and promoting the movement of tourists. Thanks to the recent development of scientific technology, the age of new message delivery systems, such as digital signage or augmented reality, has emerged to create a new environment of <b>tourist</b> <b>information.</b> The purpose of this paper is to introduce a theoretical approach to the study of <b>tourist</b> <b>information,</b> and attempt to establish a field of information in the theoretical study of tourism.
