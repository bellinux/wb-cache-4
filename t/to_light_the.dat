The heat of the flame and the emotion of the crowd power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E

5|$|The pews and the {{elevated}} pulpit {{date from the}} 19th century. The church has some marble memorials on the walls, dating from the 18th century, and a 15th-century octagonal font. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a bier from 1746, an oak communion table from about 1700, and an inscribed Elizabethan silver cup. Paraffin lamps are used <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> church, {{since there is no}} electricity connection.|$|E
5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The collimator was mounted on a prominent arm that projected above and {{in front of the}} sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> collimator as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E

5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> <b>the</b> GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use electricity <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity. The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seas}} off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous {{efforts to protect}} their captures; Corona was heavily on fire in {{consequence}} of her engagement with Active and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed. Problems were also experienced aboard Bellona, where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.|$|E
5|$|Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos' {{group to}} the Mercury Lighthouse, joined by Ivan and Mia. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent Saturos from {{activating}} Mercury Lighthouse with the Mercury Star. Saturos' group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac's party remaining in pursuit. In the ensuing chase, Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another Adept hostage: the female Jupiter Adept, Sheba. Saturos and Menardi activate the Venus Lighthouse with the Venus Star, and are confronted by Isaac's party immediately thereafter. Attempting to annihilate their opponents, Saturos and Menardi magically merge to form a massive two-headed dragon, but Isaac's party slay Saturos and Menardi. Directly following this, Sheba falls from the lighthouse and Felix proceeds to jump out after her. The remnants of Saturos' group (unbeknownst to the players until Golden Sun: The Lost Age), headed by Felix and Alex, continue their quest <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> remaining two Lighthouses, with Jenna, Sheba, and Kraden still with them. The game ends as Isaac's party boards a ship and sail out into Weyard's open seas to continue their mission.|$|E

5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> <b>The</b> species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2015, {{the candle}} was lit {{nearly two weeks}} prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> candle to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The candle remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event.|$|E
5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and practical light at filming locations.

He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
5|$|The railway came to Christchurch in 1847 {{although}} the nearest station, Christchurch Road, was at Holmsley and passengers were taken {{the rest of}} the way by omnibus. In 1862 a new station was built in the town close to where it stands today and was served by a branch line from Ringwood. Christchurch joined the mainline in 1883 and a third station had to be built. Christchurch, and in particular Mudeford, had been enjoying a modest tourist trade since King George III had patronised the town in the 1790s but the arrival of the railways made Christchurch accessible to more potential visitors. A power station was built in Christchurch in 1903 to power the public trams. The excess generated was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>the</b> town and in 1940 it was added to the national grid.|$|E
