25|$|<b>Tetrafluoromethane,</b> {{also known}} as carbon tetrafluoride, is the {{simplest}} fluorocarbon (CF4). It has a very high bond strength {{due to the nature}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. It can also be classified as a haloalkane or halomethane. Because of the multiple carbon–fluorine bonds, and the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon in <b>tetrafluoromethane</b> has a significant positive partial charge which strengthens and shortens the four carbon–fluorine bonds by providing additional ionic character. <b>Tetrafluoromethane</b> is a potent greenhouse gas.|$|E
25|$|According to Guinness World Records <b>Tetrafluoromethane</b> is {{the most}} {{persistent}} greenhouse gas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetrafluoromethane</b> can be {{prepared}} in the laboratory by the reaction of silicon carbide with fluorine.|$|E
25|$|Due to its density, <b>tetrafluoromethane</b> can {{displace}} air, {{creating an}} asphyxiation hazard in inadequately ventilated areas.|$|E
25|$|Carbon–fluorine {{bonds are}} the strongest single bonds in organic chemistry. Additionally, they {{strengthen}} as more carbon–fluorine bonds {{are added to}} the same carbon. In the one carbon organofluorine compounds represented by molecules of fluoromethane, difluoromethane, trifluoromethane, and <b>tetrafluoromethane,</b> the carbon–fluorine bonds are strongest in <b>tetrafluoromethane.</b> This effect is due to the increased coulombic attractions between the fluorine atoms and the carbon because the carbon has a positive partial charge of 0.76.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetrafluoromethane,</b> {{like other}} fluorocarbons, is very stable {{due to the}} {{strength}} of its carbon–fluorine bonds. The bonds in <b>tetrafluoromethane</b> have a bonding energy of 515 kJ⋅mol−1. As a result, it is inert to acids and hydroxides. However, it reacts explosively with alkali metals. Thermal decomposition or combustion of CF4 produces toxic gases (carbonyl fluoride and carbon monoxide) and in the presence of water will also yield hydrogen fluoride.|$|E
25|$|Main {{industrial}} emissions of <b>tetrafluoromethane</b> besides hexafluoroethane are produced during production of aluminium using Hall-Héroult process. CF4 also is produced as {{product of the}} breakdown of more complex compounds such as halocarbons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetrafluoromethane</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} low temperature refrigerant. It is used in electronics microfabrication alone or in combination with oxygen as a plasma etchant for silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride. It also has uses in neutron detectors.|$|E
25|$|Although {{structurally}} {{similar to}} chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), <b>tetrafluoromethane</b> does not deplete the ozone layer.

25|$|<b>Tetrafluoromethane</b> is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas {{that contributes to the}} greenhouse effect. It is very stable, has an atmospheric lifetime of 50,000 years, and a high greenhouse warming potential of 6500 (which is given for the first 100 years thereof, CO2 has a factor of 1); however, the low amount in the atmosphere restricts the overall radiative forcing effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tetrafluoromethane</b> is {{the product}} when any carbon compound, {{including}} carbon itself, is burned {{in an atmosphere of}} fluorine. With hydrocarbons, hydrogen fluoride is a coproduct. It was first reported in 1926. It can also be prepared by the fluorination of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or phosgene with sulfur tetrafluoride. Commercially it is manufactured by the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with dichlorodifluoromethane or chlorotrifluoromethane; it is also produced during the electrolysis of metal fluorides MF, MF2 using a carbon electrode.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{application}} of fluorine gas, consuming up to 7,000metrictons annually, {{is in the}} preparation of [...] for the nuclear fuel cycle. Fluorine is used to fluorinate uranium tetrafluoride, itself formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid.

About 6,000metrictons per year go into producing the inert dielectric [...] for high-voltage transformers and circuit breakers, eliminating the need for hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls associated with [...] devices. Several fluorine compounds are used in electronics: rhenium and tungsten hexafluoride in chemical vapor deposition, <b>tetrafluoromethane</b> in plasma etching and nitrogen trifluoride in cleaning equipment.

2500|$|Formally, {{fluorocarbons}} only contain {{carbon and}} fluorine. [...] Sometimes {{they are called}} perfluorocarbons.

[...] While fluorocarbons with single bonds are stable, unsaturated fluorocarbons are more reactive, especially those with triple bonds.Fluorocarbons are more chemically and thermally stable than hydrocarbons, reflecting the relative inertness of the C-F bond. They are also relatively lipophobic. [...] Because of the reduced intermolecular van der Waals interactions, fluorocarbon-based compounds are sometimes used as lubricants or are highly volatile. Fluorocarbon liquids have medical applications as oxygen carriers.|$|E
