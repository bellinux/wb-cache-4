50|$|It is {{synthesized}} via {{a number}} of processes, but representative is the following route from <b>trinitrobenzene.</b> It is a selective trinitration where benzene is symmetrically trinitrated to 1,3,5 <b>trinitrobenzene</b> to produce a precursor for the synthesis of phloroglucinol.|$|E
50|$|It {{is useful}} for the {{industrial}} synthesis of pharmaceuticals (Flopropione) and explosives (TATB (2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5- <b>trinitrobenzene),</b> trinitrophloroglucinol, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene).|$|E
50|$|TATB, {{triaminotrinitrobenzene}} or 2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5- <b>trinitrobenzene</b> is an aromatic explosive, {{based on}} the basic six-carbon benzene ring structure with three nitro functional groups (NO2) and three amine (NH2) groups attached, alternating around the ring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trinitrobenzene</b> is used {{primarily}} as a high explosive for commercial mining and military use. Some other uses include a narrow-range pH indicator, an agent to vulcanize natural rubber, and a mediating agent to mediate the synthesis of other explosive compounds.|$|E
50|$|Research of {{the effects}} on {{abnormal}} cannabidiol in mice has indicated that atypical cannabinoids have therapeutic potential {{in a variety of}} inflammatory conditions, including those of the gastrointestinal tract. After inducing colitis by means of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid, wound healing of both human umbilical vein endothelial and epithelial cells was enhanced by the Abn-CBD.|$|E
50|$|The early {{development}} {{of this type of}} complex takes place {{around the turn of the}} 19th century. In 1886 Janovski observed an intense violet color when he mixed meta-dinitrobenzene with an alcoholic solution of alkali. In 1895 Lobry de Bruyn investigated a red substance formed in the reaction of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> with potassium hydroxide in methanol. In 1900 Jackson and Gazzolo reacted trinitroanisole with sodium methoxide and proposed a quinoid structure for the reaction product.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} modes of {{exposure}} are either {{direct contact with}} the substance or through drinking contaminated water. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene is believed to cause similar health problems as TNT. Exposure to high concentrations most commonly causes anemia, or the reduced ability for blood to carry oxygen. As a result of the lack of oxygen, the skin typically becomes blue or purple in color. Other symptoms of exposure include headache, nausea, and dizziness. The long-term effects from exposure are not known because no long-term studies of health effects have been performed. It is believed that long-term exposure will cause sterility (especially in males) and cataracts. It is unknown if <b>Trinitrobenzene</b> causes birth defects or cancer.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s the {{discovery}} of zinc peroxide’s ability to complement pyrotechnical mixtures was discovered. It was noted that ZnO2 was preferable to the usage of barium compounds, as it was deemed to be less toxic. The zinc compound proves an effective component in explosives because of its oxidizing properties. Many chemical explosives rely on rapid oxidation reactions, for this reason ZnO2 is an ideal candidate for use in pyrotechnics. Another advantage of ZnO2 was, {{as compared to the}} barium and strontium pyroingredients, it effects less corrosion in the metallic materials which contain the compounds in the pyrotechnic instrument. In one modality it is necessary for zinc peroxide to act in conjunction with a reducer like calcium silicide, to create the necessary red/ox reaction. In another modality, a ‘secondary’ explosive is mixed with zinc peroxide. Secondary explosives include nitrocellulose, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), as well as a variety of compounds, like <b>trinitrobenzene,</b> which provide powerful negative charge balance.These secondary explosives are relatively insensitive to stimuli such as physical impact, heat or charge. The explosive mixture would be comprised, in bulk, of the secondary explosive with a much smaller fraction of zinc peroxide, present to initiate the reaction.|$|E

In the present study we evaluated the healing effects of 50 % ethanol extract of dried leaves of Azadirachta indica on <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid-induced colitis in rats. Azadirachta indica extract (500 mg/kg) was administered orally, once daily for 14 days and studied for its effects on diarrhoea, food and water intake, body weight changes, colonic damage and inflammation, histology, antibacterial activity and free radicals (nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation), antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione) and myeloperoxidase activities in colonic tissue. Intracolonic <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid increased colonic mucosal damage and inflammation, diarrhea, but decreased body weight which were reversed by Azadirachta indica extract and sulfasalazine (positive control) treatments. Azadirachta indica extract showed antibacterial activity. Azadirachta indica extract and sulfasalazine enhanced the antioxidants but decreased free radicals and myeloperoxidase activities affected in <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid-induced colitis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Growing {{evidence}} suggests that intestinal recovery from injury induced by radiation, endotoxin, and protein deficiency is improved by the ingestion of nucleosides and nucleotides. AIM: This study examined the effect of dietary nucleosides and nucleotides supplementation on <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid induced colonic damage in experimental colitis. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into two groups and fed nucleic acid free 20 % casein diet (control) or this diet supplemented with 0. 5 % nucleoside-nucleotide mixture for four weeks. On the second week, colonic inflammation was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 0. 25 ml of 50 % ethanol containing 25 mg of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid. Additionally, other sets of rats were treated with 0. 25 ml of 50 % ethanol, 25 mg of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid in 0. 25 ml saline, or 0. 25 ml of 0. 9 % saline. RESULTS: After two weeks, colon weight, macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, were significantly greater (p < 0. 05) in the nucleoside-nucleotide supplemented group compared with the non-supplemented control groups. The same variables seen in the <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid-ethanol group fed nucleoside-nucleotide free diet were greater (p < 0. 05) than {{in the rest of}} the groups fed nucleoside-nucleotide free diet and treated with ethanol, <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid in saline, or saline. Histologically, segmental ulceration and inflammation associated with significantly increased infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts were observed in the supplemented group compared with the controls. In the nucleoside-nucleotide supplemented group the epithelial damage, mucosal erosion, oedema, and coagulative necrosis of the muscularis propria was more extensive in comparison to the non-supplemented control groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that dietary nucleosides and nucleotides may aggravate colonic damage and inflammation in chemically induced experimental colitis in rats; and that nucleoside-nucleotide free diet combined with other pharmacological agents may offer a better response...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of smooth muscle cells {{as a potential}} source of eicosanoid production during in � ammatory states remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid (TNB), a known pro-in � ammatory agent, on jejunal smooth muscle cell eicosanoid production. Human gut-derived smooth muscle cells (HISM) were incubated with TNB for 1 hour. Additionally, some cells were preincubated with either dimethylthiourea, or indomethacin for 1 hour before exposure to identical concentrations of TNB. Incubation with TNB led to signi � cant increases in PGE 2 and 6 -keto PGF- 1 a release, but not leukotriene B 4 release; responses which were both inhibited by dimethylthiourea and indomethacin treatment. Our results suggest that gutderived smooth muscle cells may represent {{an important source of}} proin � ammatory prostanoids but not leukotrienes during in � ammatory states of the intestine. The inhibition of prostanoid activity by thiourea may be mediated by suppression of cyclooxygenase activity in this cell line.

40|$|WE {{investigated}} whether TNB alters colonic tissue {{levels of}} PAF {{at the expense}} of changes in colonic motility in the isolated perfused rabbit left colon. Colonic inflammation was induced by the intracolonic administration of 0. 25 ml of 50 % ethanol containing 30 mg of <b>trinitrobenzene.</b> Strain gauge transducers were sewn onto the serosal surface of the colon to evaluate colonic motility. TNB administration increased tissue levels of PAF and increased the average force of each colonic contraction. Pretreatment with the PAF receptor antagonist WEB- 2170 prior to TNB infusion decreased tissue concentrations of PAF and ameliorated the altered motility parameters seen with TNB alone. These results suggest that PAF is stimulated by TNB and may participate in colonic dysmotility during inflammatory states.

40|$|Quercitrin is a {{flavonoid}} with antiinflammatory {{activity in}} experimental colitis, {{associated with an}} antioxidative action and amelioration of water absorption in vivo. However, its mechanism of action is unclear. This study focuses {{on the effect of}} quercitrin (1 and 5 mg/kg) in the early stages (24 h) of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid colitis. Treatment with the flavonoid prevented the increase in colonic malondialdehyde and inhibited nitric oxide synthase and alkaline phosphatase activity but had no significant effects on observable damage. No effect on neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase) was observed. On the other hand, quercitrin exerted complex effects on colonic hydroelectrolytic transport, showing a slight potentiation of water absorption in vivo (5 mg/kg) as well as a normalization of carbachol stimulated electrogenic ionic transport in the proximal colon in vitro (5 mg/kg). It is concluded that the beneficial effects of quercitrin on <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid chronic colitis arise from an early downregulation of the inflammatory cascade that is associated with amelioration of th...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ketotifen, a 'mast cell stabiliser,' on two models of {{experimental}} colitis were examined. The inflammatory response elicited by either <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid or acetic acid resulted in increased colonic synthesis of platelet activating factor, prostaglandin E 2, thromboxane B 2, leukotrienes B 4 and C 4, and myeloperoxidase activity. Intragastric administration of ketotifen 100 micrograms/ 100 grams twice daily significantly decreased mucosal damage when given prophylactically 48 {{hours before the}} induction of colitis and then throughout the experiment. This effect was consistent in both models and {{was accompanied by a}} significant reduction in mucosal generation of platelet activating factor, prostaglandin E 2, thromboxane B 2, and leukotrienes C 4 and B 4. Myeloperoxidase activity was reduced as well, reaching significance only in the acetic acid model. This study shows that both <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid and acetic acid colitis can be pharmacologically manipulated by ketotifen. The mechanism of action of ketotifen has not yet been determined. Ketotifen's potential in the treatment of active inflammatory bowel disease or in the prevention of exacertations, or both, remains to be elucidated...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that ghrelin reduces colonic {{inflammation}} induced by <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid and dextran sodium sulfate. In the present study we determined the effect of treatment with ghrelin on the course of acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. Rectal administration of 3 % acetic acid solution led to induction of colitis in all animals. Damage of the colonic wall was accompanied by an increase in mucosal concentration of pro-inflammatory interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well mucosal activity of myeloperoxidase. Moreover, induction of colitis led to a reduction in colonic blood flow and DNA synthesis. Administration of ghrelin after induction of colitis led to faster regeneration of the colonic wall and reduction in colonic levels of IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and myeloperoxidase. In addition, treatment with ghrelin improved mucosal DNA synthesis and blood flow. Our study disclosed that ghrelin exhibits a strong anti-inflammatory and healing effect in acetic acid-induced colitis. Our current observation in association with previous findings that ghrelin exhibits curative effect in <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid- and dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis suggest that therapeutic effect of ghrelin in the colon is universal and independent of the primary cause of colitis...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{analysis has}} been conducted on the capacity a highly-reactive, water soluble hapten, <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid, to induce contact hypersensitivity when applied epicutaneously to body wall skin of normal mice. Application of plastic chambers containing the hapten to murine skin {{for as little as}} 1 h produced readily detectable sensitization in several genetically disparate inbred strains. Moreover, the efficiency of sensitization was found to be similar to that following epicutaneous application of this hapten's lipid-soluble cogener, trinitrochlorobenzene. Using this approach, it has been determined that UVB radiation, intradermally injected tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and epicutaneously applied cis-urocanic acid can impair contact hypersensitivity induction by transepidermally delivered <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid, and that animals that fail to become sensitized proceed to acquire hapten-specific unresponsiveness. It is concluded that epicutaneous sensitization to chemically reactive, water-soluble molecules is experimentally attainable if precautions are taken to insure that contact between the hapten solution and the cutaneous surface is maintained for at least 1 h. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sensitization and tolerance induction by epicutaneously applied water soluble haptens may prove to be important in understanding the pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis that develops to chemicals in the industrial setting, in the environment, and in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid with amino phospholipids, {{and in particular}} phosphatidylethanolamine has been studied by the monolayer technique. Injection of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulphonic acid under a monolayer of amino phospholipid results {{in an increase in}} surface pressure. The rate and extent of the pressure change is greatly affected by the initial surface pressure, the fatty acid composition of the lipid, and the presence of other non-reactive lipids, especially negatively charged phospholipids. The extent of the reaction was measured with 32 P-labelled phospholipids isolated from Bacillus subtilis. Only about 80 % of the phosphatidylethanolamine in the monolayer could be converted to its trinitrophenyl derivative. In the presence of negatively charged phospholipids such as cardiolipin or phosphatidylglycerol, a further 20 % decrease in the trinitrophenylation of phosphatidylethanolamine was found. The pressure increase occurring during trinitrophenylation could also be correlated with the extent of the reaction by comparison of the force-area curves of pure phosphatidylethanolamine, its trinitrophenyl derivative and mixtures of both compounds. The data may offer an explanation for the observation that incomplete labelling of amino phospholipids frequently occurs in natural membranes and furthermore indicate that the use of chemical labelling techniques in the study of lipid asymmetry in biological membranes must be approached with great caution...|$|E

40|$|Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) {{are being}} studied for their {{antiproliferative}} effects in preclinical cancer trials. Recent studies suggest an anti-inflammatory role for {{this class of}} compounds. Because inflammatory bowel disease is {{associated with an increased}} risk of malignancies, agents with antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties would be of therapeutic interest. HDAC inhibitors from various classes were selected and evaluated for their in vitro capacity to suppress cytokine production and to induce apoptosis and histone acetylation. Valproic acid (VPA) and suberyolanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) were chosen for further studies in dextran sulfate sodium- and <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid-induced colitis in mice. In vitro, inhibition of HDAC resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of cytokine synthesis and apoptosis induction requiring higher concentrations of HDAC inhibitors for apoptosis induction compared with cytokine inhibition. Oral administration of either VPA or SAHA reduced disease severity in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. The macroscopic and histologic reduction of disease severity was associated with a marked suppression of colonic proinflammatory cytokines. In parallel to the beneficial effect observed, a dose-dependent increase in histone 3 acetylation at the site of inflammation was shown under VPA treatment. Furthermore, SAHA as well as VPA treatment resulted in amelioration of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid-induced colitis, which was associated with an increase of apoptosis of lamina propria lymphocytes.

Colitis was induced by intracolonic administration of <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid. At various timepoints thereafter (2 h to 14 days), colonic tissue levels of several chemokines were measured. Unlike the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, macrophage inflammatory protein- 2, and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, the expression of RANTES was significantly elevated during the chronic phase of colitis (> 7 days after induction). Colonic RANTES mRNA expression was also significantly elevated during the chronic phase of colitis. The numbers of macrophages and monocytes in the colonic mucosa increased substantially during the chronic phase, as did expression of two of the receptors (CCR 1 and CCR 5) to which RANTES is known to bind. Administration on days 7 through 14 after <b>trinitrobenzene</b> sulfonic acid administration of a CCR 1 /CCR 5 receptor antagonist, Met-RANTES, resulted in a significant reduction of both macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage, as well as reducing the recruitment into the colon of monocytes, mast cells, and neutrophils.
