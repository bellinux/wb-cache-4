5000|$|Henryson's {{portrayal}} of Cresseid's 'disgrace' and ultimately tragic end, through {{the narrator of}} the poem, is observed with a largely rigorous objectivity. Where the narrator comes to judge, rather than reinforcing the institutional admonishment of a 'shocked' or disapproving society, he 'confesses' to his natural pity for Cresseid's misfortune, against the standard view of 'false womanhood' which she was taken in his day to represent. This is perhaps all the more expressive for having been apparently withheld or 'repressed' within the conceit of the poem. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> of this breaks through in the passage: ...|$|E

Harmon also issued <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> of {{what became known as}} the American doctrine of absolute sovereignty, [...] "the rules, principles and precedents of international law impose no liability or obligation upon the United States" [...] in a case involving a claim by Mexico for damages from diverting the waters of the Rio Grande.|$|E
40|$|In this essay, I {{trace the}} {{enabling}} {{conditions for the}} major statement of the subversive subtext in Bilhaṇa’s Vikramāṅkadevacarita (VDC) by unpacking {{the operation of the}} work’s patent, eulogistic text. In particular, I will explore the place given to the depiction of male intimacy as a poetic substitute or simulacrum for the political alliances central to Vikramāditya’s coming to the throne, as described in the mahākāvya’s fourth through sixth sargas. My intention in focusing on the intense friendships between men is to highlight a significant rhetorical strategy of Bilhaṇa’s, which allowed the poet both to introduce and to buffer <b>the</b> poem's <b>most</b> <b>explicit</b> <b>statement</b> of his skepticism towards royal power. It is this charged affective theme—one that occupied only a tenuous position within the regnant critical discourse of literary emotion at the time—that sets up Bilhaṇa’s <b>most</b> powerful and <b>explicit</b> denunciation of kingship. The explicit theme of royal praise and the subtext of its denunciation can thus be seen as contrapuntally related, which goes some way towards explaining how the court poet was able to successfully carry off his potentially incendiary literary project...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to derive a set of hermeneutical principles of {{the author of the book}} of Hebrews from the introductory formulae and, to a lesser degree, to contrast these with contemporary hermeneutical approaches. The research is important for three reasons. Firstly, the introductory formulae have largely been neglected as a source for consideration when analysing the hermeneutic of a writer, such that this study is, to some degree, ground-breaking in nature. Secondly, the introductory formulae provide the clearest presentation of the author’s hermeneutic in that here may be found <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>explicit</b> <b>statements</b> revealing <b>the</b> author’s hermeneutic rather than deriving these. Thirdly, in the book of Hebrews we have the best example of how a New Testament writer interpreted <b>the</b> Old Testament (<b>most</b> quotations and introductory formulae per size of book). The research was conducted along the following lines: A comprehensive and workable list of introductory formulae in Hebrews was derived. This list was compared and contrasted firstly within the book itself and secondly in comparison to that of the other New Testament writers. A set of principles was derived from the introductory formulae of Hebrews and compared to the hermeneutics of contemporary modern approaches. The results of {{the research}} are encapsulated in six principles which together summarise the author of Hebrews’ hermeneutic. The Old Testament is understood as, [...] spoken not written, [...] spoken by a Trinitarian God comprising Father, Son and Holy Spirit, [...] dynamic, that is, spoken with equal authority and equal effect to a current generation, [...] authoritative and complete, [...] the words of God do not require the intervention of man but rather the removal of man permitting God to address His people personally, [...] pertaining to the person and work of Christ. The conclusion of the research can be summarised in one sentence: “God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) is speaking to you now and what He says concerns His Son. ” When these principles are compared with contemporary modern hermeneutic, the following is observed; [...] the ‘written-and-dated’ nature of God’s revelation instead of an understanding that God is speaking to us today. [...] a focus on a single person of the Godhead and a resultant infatuation with some doctrines at the expense of others. [...] an illegitimate concern to make God relevant. [...] the reader no longer reads in order to understand but reads in order to define meaning and the meaning primarily pertains to himself [...] the listener has become the speaker and the speaker is a primarily concerned about himself and how he is coming across not about God. [...] the exposition of the Bible has degenerated from theology to anthropology. Dissertation (MA (Biblical Studies)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

Apology never treats grace, predestination, election, or justification per se. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>explicit</b> and important <b>statement</b> of soteriology in the piece—and one of the few statements concerning soteriology—amounts to a basic summary of the reformers' view of soteriology and concomitant views of man, works, the law, and Christ.We say that man is born in sin and leadeth his life in sin, and that no man can truly say his heart is clean; that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> holy man is an unprofitable servant; that the law of God is perfect, and requires of us a full and perfect obedience; and that we cannot in any way keep it perfectly in this life; and that there is no mortal who can be justified in the sight of God by his own deserts; and therefore our only refuge and safety is in the mercy of God the Father, by Jesus Christ, and in the assuring ourselves that he is the propitiation for our sins, by whose blood all our stains are washed out; that he has pacified all things by the blood of his cross; that he by that only sacrifice which he once offered upon the cross, hath perfected all things; and therefore, when he breathed out his soul, he said, IT IS FINISHED; as if by these words he would signify, Now the price is paid for the sins of mankind.
