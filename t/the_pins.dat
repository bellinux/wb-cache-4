5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. <b>The</b> <b>pins</b> still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
5000|$|Although a pin is not {{a tactic}} in itself, it {{can be useful in}} {{tactical}} situations. One tactic which takes advantage of a pin can be called working <b>the</b> <b>pin.</b> In this tactic, other pieces from <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> piece's side attack <b>the</b> opposing <b>pinned</b> piece. Since <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece cannot move out of the line of attack, <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece's player may move other pieces to defend <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece, but <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> player may yet attack with even more pieces, etc.|$|R
50|$|Dandi Biyo {{is played}} by two or more players. <b>The</b> wooden <b>pin</b> is laid across a four-inch-deep hole in the ground. One player puts {{one end of the}} stick inside the hole and holds the other end. The player jerks the stick against <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> to launch <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> into <b>the</b> air while other players called 'fielders' try to catch <b>the</b> <b>pin.</b> If one of the fielders catch <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> in <b>the</b> air, the turn is over and the catcher takes the stick. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> instead hits <b>the</b> ground, that player plays to score. One of the fielders then throws <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> into <b>the</b> hole while the player tries to hit and throw <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> away. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> goes into <b>the</b> hole, the player's turn is over and the points {{accumulated}} by the player automatically becomes zero. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> doesn't go into the hole, the player plays to score by hitting <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> at one end by the stick. In another version of the game, a circular boundary of about one-meter diameter is drawn on the ground. The player throws <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> into <b>the</b> circle from a distance of about two meters. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> lies within <b>the</b> circle the player continues to play and score.|$|R

5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down <b>the</b> <b>pins.</b> As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer {{a few feet from the}} gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel {{and a number of other}} prisoners. As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out <b>the</b> <b>pins.</b> The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5000|$|The {{computer}} program then sorts both the net list and pin list {{to be in}} alphabetic order by pin name. It then reads both lists. When <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> name in <b>the</b> netlist matches <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> name in <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> list, it copies the physical coordinates in <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> list to <b>the</b> netlist.|$|R
5000|$|To protect <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> during {{transmission}} from <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> {{entry device}} to the verifier, the standard requires that <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> be encrypted, and specifies several formats {{that may be}} used. In each case, <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> is encoded into a PIN block, which is then encrypted by an [...] "approved algorithm", according to part 2 of the standard).|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> {{entry device}} and the card reader are not both {{part of an}} {{integrated}} secure unit, then <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> shall be encrypted while it is transmitted from <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> entry device to the card reader.|$|R
25|$|Ditch: an area behind <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> {{that has}} been dug into the floor. It catches <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> that are knocked down.|$|E
25|$|Strike: hitting {{over all}} <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> within one turn.|$|E
25|$|Pins vary hugely in {{size from}} team to team, league to league, but in Bristol {{skittles}} all are symmetrical and wider around the middle. Usually in the higher leagues <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> are much narrower and conversely in the lower leagues <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> wider, although not always the case.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>pinning</b> voltage {{extraction}} method {{proposed by}} Tan et al. is analyzed to clarify its benefits and limitations. It is demonstrated that this simple measurement can bring much more useful information than <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> voltage, such as <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> photodiode capacitance and the transfer gate channel potential. Objective criteria to compare <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> voltage on different devices are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pin</b> feather looks {{somewhat}} like a feather shaft. However, unlike a fully developed feather, <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> feather has a blood supply flowing through it. As such, if <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> feather is damaged, a bird can bleed heavily.|$|R
50|$|To score, {{a player}} again knocks <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> in <b>the</b> air. Before it lands, the player hits it {{as many times}} as possible, to move it away from the hole. This process is {{repeated}} three times in which the player tries to throw <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> as far as he can. The score is calculated by multiplying the number of hits by the number of stick lengths <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> traveled. If <b>the</b> player hits <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> twice in <b>the</b> air, the score will be twice the number of stick lengths <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> traveled.|$|R
25|$|Split: <b>The</b> <b>pins</b> {{left after}} the first ball has been played.|$|E
25|$|Spot: The {{marks on}} the plate which <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> are placed.|$|E
25|$|In each of {{the first}} nine boxes, play {{proceeds}} as follows: The first player bowls his first ball at <b>the</b> <b>pins.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pins</b> he knocks down are counted and scored. Then the player rolls a second and a third ball at any remaining targets. If all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (a strike), the player receives ten points plus the count on the next two rolls, <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> are cleared, a new set placed. If all ten pins are knocked down with two balls (a spare), the player receives 10 points plus the count of the next ball, pins are cleared and reset. If all three balls are needed to knock all <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> down, the score for that frame is simply ten, and known in New England as a ten-box. If more than one player is playing on the same lane at the same time, bowlers will typically roll two complete boxes before yielding the lane to the next bowler.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} ATM models was the IBM 3624, which used the IBM method to generate what is termed a natural <b>PIN.</b> <b>The</b> natural <b>PIN</b> is generated by encrypting the primary account number (PAN), using an encryption key generated specifically for the purpose. This key is {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> generation key (PGK). This PIN {{is directly related to the}} primary account number. To validate <b>the</b> <b>PIN,</b> <b>the</b> issuing bank regenerates <b>the</b> <b>PIN</b> using <b>the</b> above method, and compares this with <b>the</b> entered <b>PIN.</b>|$|R
25|$|With a penannular brooch, <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> {{is pushed}} through {{folds of the}} cloth, which are then pulled back inside the ring; the free end of <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> passes through <b>the</b> gap in <b>the</b> ring. <b>The</b> <b>pin</b> is then rotated around the ring by 90 degrees or so, so {{that as long as}} <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> is held down by slight {{pressure}} it cannot escape over the terminals, and the fastening is secure.|$|R
50|$|To {{validate}} <b>the</b> <b>PIN,</b> <b>the</b> {{issuing bank}} calculates <b>the</b> natural <b>PIN</b> as in <b>the</b> above method, then adds the offset and compares this value to <b>the</b> entered <b>PIN.</b>|$|R
25|$|King pin: The 5-pin, {{which is}} in the center of <b>the</b> <b>pins,</b> and {{directly}} behind the head pin.|$|E
25|$|Spare: when {{a player}} knocks down all nine pins with 2 balls, {{allowing}} a third throw with <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> re-set.|$|E
25|$|Punch: {{when the}} ball hits the pin dead centre and ploughs through {{afterwards}} knocking down the pin behind but not <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> either side.|$|E
50|$|Players {{take turns}} {{throwing}} a quoit at <b>the</b> <b>pin.</b> <b>The</b> quoit nearest <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> gets one point. If one player has two quoits nearer <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> {{than either of}} his opponent's quoits, he gets two points. A quoit that encircles <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> (called a ringer) gets three points. If all four quoits are ringers, the player who threw the last ringer gets three points only; otherwise, {{the first player to}} make 21 points wins the game. For two or four players.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} version of Google Maps, <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> was displayed with the letters [...] "A" [...] through [...] "J" [...] when {{there was more than}} one search results. In later versions, <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> was shown with a black dot inside to mark a single location. In 2011, Google released a minor redesign of <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> that changed <b>the</b> black outline of <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> to a dark red for a softer look.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, UTSL {{allows the}} user to define {{the state of the}} {{instrument}} i.e. connected to <b>the</b> <b>pin,</b> or disconnected from <b>the</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
25|$|Because {{this was}} rarely {{implemented}} in practice, it was deleted from revision 2.2 of the PCI specification, and <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> re-used for SMBus access in revision 2.3.|$|E
25|$|The {{depth of}} the sockets varies between {{countries}} and age. Older sockets are so shallow {{that it is possible}} to touch <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> of a plug when the plug is inserted only deep enough to get electrical power on <b>the</b> <b>pins,</b> while newer sockets are deep enough to protect from this kind of accident. CEE7/1 sockets accept CEE7/4, CEE7/6 and CEE7/7 plugs without providing an earth connection. The earthed CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets were specifically designed not to allow insertion of CEE7/2 unearthed round plugs fitted to older appliances which had to be earthed via other means.|$|E
25|$|A foul always scores zero (0) pinfall {{for that}} ball's delivery. A player may reset <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> after a foul {{on the first}} or second ball {{provided}} no pins have legally been felled in that box. Therefore, if on the first ball there is a foul or zero, and on the second ball the bowler fouls and knocks down pins, <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> may be reset, allowing the bowler an opportunity to score a ten box on their third ball. Knocking down all ten pins after resetting immediately following a foul in the first ball results in a spare. Fouling on all three attempts scores a zero box.|$|E
5000|$|Refrain from {{touching}} another person’s pins or lanyard, {{ask to see}} <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> so {{they can}} bring <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> into closer view.|$|R
50|$|A pin is a {{move that}} {{inhibits}} an opponent piece from moving, because doing so would expose a more valuable (or vulnerable) piece behind it. Only bishops, rooks, and queens can perform a pin, since they can move more than one square in a straight line. If <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece cannot move because doing so would produce check, <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> is called absolute. If moving <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece would expose a non-king piece, <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> is called relative.|$|R
50|$|If a rook or queen is pinned along a file or rank, or {{a bishop}} or queen is pinned along a diagonal, <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> is a partial pin: <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> unit can still move along its line but cannot leave that line. A {{partially}} pinned unit may break its own <b>pin</b> by capturing <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> piece; however, a partial pin {{can still be}} advantageous to <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> player, for instance if <b>the</b> queen is <b>pinned</b> by a rook or bishop, and <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> piece is defended, so that capturing it with the queen would lose material. Note that a queen can only ever be partially pinned, as it can move in any linear direction.|$|R
