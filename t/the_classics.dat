5|$|Szigeti {{was an avid}} {{champion}} of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside <b>the</b> <b>classics.</b> Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty.|$|E
5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz {{is based}} on three short stories Miller contributed to The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It is the only novel {{published}} by the author during his lifetime. (His follow-up work, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was published posthumously in 1997.) Considered one of <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> of science fiction, {{it has never been}} out of print and has seen over 25 reprints and editions. Appealing to mainstream and genre critics and readers alike, it won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel.|$|E

50|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> 350 and <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> 500 feature <b>the</b> {{new unit}} {{construction}} engine in their 350cc and 500cc variants respectively. However <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> 350 uses a carburettor for fuel delivery and <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> 500 has EFI. Also <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> 350 has an ammeter while <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> 500 {{has a low}} fuel indicator light and engine check light instead of the ammeter. The ammeter on <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> 350 {{is more of a}} vestigial remain as <b>the</b> modern <b>Classic</b> 350 has no practical use for it. In the older models with CB points, when the piston was in the top dead centre (CB Points closed) then the ammeter would stay in the middle. This feature allowed the rider to use the decompresson lever to move the piston to top dead center and kick starter with relative ease. Both of these models are more expensive and targeted at a market segment above the Royal Enfield Bullet 350 and the Bullet 500.|$|R
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} in his diary, Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of <b>the</b> <b>Classics</b> and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught <b>the</b> <b>Classics</b> and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{was exposed}} to {{multiple}} influences through his life. As an undergraduate student of Howison, he learned about philosophy and religion. At Yale and later at Wundt's lab, he switched to experimental psychology and studied perception, memory and emotion. His exposure to World War I, serving in the Army then, focused his mind on issues {{of war and peace}} and international relations. Stratton's later work reflected these elements of his experience. He was also a scholar of <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E

40|$|The {{spatial pattern}} of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> (‘cored’) type of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposit was {{studied in the}} upper laminae of the {{superior}} temporal gyrus in 9 cases of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD). Abeta stained tissue was counterstained with collagen IV to study {{the relationships between the}} spatial distribution of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and <b>the</b> blood vessel profiles. Both <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and blood vessel profiles were distributed in clusters. In all cases, there was a spatial correlation between the clusters of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and <b>the</b> larger diameter (> 10 micron) blood vessel profiles and especially the vertically penetrating arterioles. In only 1 case, was there a significant spatial correlation between the clusters of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits and <b>the</b> smaller diameter (< 10 micron) capillaries. In 9 / 11 cases, the clusters of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits were significantly larger than those of the clusters of the larger blood vessels. In addition, the density of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits declined as a negative exponential function with distance from the vertically penetrating arterioles. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> Abeta deposits cluster around the larger blood vessels in the frontal cortex and that diffusion of proteins from these blood vessels could be involved in the pathogenesis of <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> deposits in SAD...|$|R

5|$|The humanists {{believed}} {{that it is important}} to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} built for strong showings in the classic cycle races, and {{includes}} the best classics rider from the 2010 season, world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara. Though Cancellara did not win any race that awarded points to the UCI World Tour, he consistently placed highly enough that he was briefly the world number one rider {{in the midst of}} <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> season. Thanks to Cancellara's performances and the Schleck brothers both finishing on the podium at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the team was also in the top spot for a time.|$|E
5|$|Through the Middle Ages Etymologiae was the {{textbook}} most in use, regarded so highly as {{a repository of}} classical learning that, in a great measure, it superseded {{the use of the}} individual works of <b>the</b> <b>classics</b> themselves, full texts of which were no longer copied and thus were lost. It {{was one of the most}} popular compendia in medieval libraries.|$|E
5|$|What may be {{revealed}} by Hori's {{attack on the}} way in which some Ramesside scribes felt obliged to demonstrate their greater or lesser acquaintance with ancient literature is the conception that these venerable works were meant to be known in full and not to be misused as quarries for popular sayings mined deliberately from the past. <b>The</b> <b>classics</b> of the time were to be memorized completely and comprehended thoroughly before being cited.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that Confucius did encourage his followers to study the songs contained in <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> of Poetry, helping to secure <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> of Poetrys place among <b>the</b> Five <b>Classics.</b> After Confucian ideas became further entrenched in Chinese culture (after about 100 BCE), Confuciuss endorsement led many scholars to study the lyrics of <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> of Poetry and interpret them as political allegories and commentaries.|$|R

5|$|With {{increased}} interest in women's history by classical scholars, a number of related disciplines have also become more significant.

The history of childhood emerged as a sub-discipline of history during the 1960s, and other disciplines such as the study of ancient medicine have been influenced by feminist approaches to <b>the</b> <b>classics.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany.

In the last of <b>the</b> <b>classics,</b> the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races.

It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It {{was also one of the}} earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).|$|E
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> II {{shares a}} case with <b>the</b> earlier <b>Classic,</b> architecturally {{it is more}} similar to the Macintosh LC.
