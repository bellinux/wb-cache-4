40|$|A {{structural}} {{study of}} Witteberg Group Rocks was conducted along the Soutkloof River, approximately 14 km east of Steytlerville, Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Here a {{north to south}} geotraverse was studied in an attempt at unravelling the structural geology of the rocks belonging to the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous Witteberg Group (Upper Cape Supergroup). These rocks are mostly arenaceous and include quartzite, sandstone, siltstone and shale which have been folded, faulted and metamorphosed. Thrust, normal and strike-slip faulting occur in the area. Shallow south-dipping low-angle <b>thrust</b> fault <b>planes</b> are displaced by steep south-dipping <b>thrust</b> <b>planes</b> and subordinate north-dipping backthrusts. Displacement along <b>thrust</b> <b>planes</b> is predominantly northwards. Steeply dipping <b>thrust</b> fault <b>planes</b> are often reactivated as east-west striking normal faults. Strike-slip faulting postdates all observed structural features and displaces normal and <b>thrust</b> fault <b>planes.</b> Open to tight folds are present and are mostly northvergent and often steepened or truncated by steep south-dipping <b>thrust</b> fault <b>planes.</b> South-vergent folds are related to backthrusting and post-fold faulting. The study has revealed that the current geological map and the local stratigraphy were compiled without recognising major structural features such as thrust, normal and strike-slip faulting and their (the map and currently accepted stratigraphy) validity are therefore questioned. The presence of extensive faulting suggests that the conventional stratigraphic interpretation of the Witteberg Group should be revised...|$|R

40|$|The studied area, {{belonging}} to the Central Apennines, is comprises between the M. Filone-M. Navegna ridge in the west, and the M. Calvo-Colle dei Montanari ridge in the east. Four tectonic units, characterized by different sedimentary successions and by different structural setting can be recognized in the area. They form a complex embricate fan thrust system and are, from the higher to the lower one: Reatini unit, Navegna unit, Salto-Nuria-Calvo unit, La Torretta unit. The Reatini unit is made of the Umbria-Marchean sedimentary succession, and is tectonically placed on the Navegna and the Salto- Nuria-Calvo units, by a <b>thrust</b> <b>plane</b> developed along the Ancona- Anzio Auct. tectonic line. Its internal structural setting {{is characterized by a}} minor <b>thrust</b> <b>plane</b> that placed a syncline involving the Jurassic deposits on the overturned Cretaceous-Paleogene succession. A Mesozoic slope-to-basin and a Cenozoic carbonate ramp succession, developed along the northwestern margin of the Lazio- Abruzzi carbonate platform paleodomain constitutes the Navegna unit, located in the south of the Reatini unit. It is overthrust onto the Salto-Nuria-Calvo unit by a <b>thrust</b> <b>plane</b> which corresponds to the Olevano-Antrodoco line. Several minor thrust planes associated to narrow hangingwall anticlines verging eastward in the Navegna unit have been recognized. The Salto-Nuria-Calvo unit can be divided in three sector {{belonging to}} the Lazio-Abruzzi carbonate platform paleodomain: the sedimentary succession of the Salto sector is made up of Cretaceous carbonate platform deposits, covered unconformably by a Miocene succession of carbonate ramp environment, and by a thick Early Messinian siliciclastic turbidites succession. The internal structural setting comprises minor folds and thrust planes that constitute carbonate ridges surrounded by siliciclastic deposits. On the eastern side of Salto lake, small carbonate ridges sometimes associated to back thrust planes occur. The M. Nuria sector is made of a Mesocenozoic sedimentary succession deposited in a carbonate platform environment, that passes southeastward to carbonate margin deposits. The stratigraphic organization shows a progressive sinking of this sector during Cretaceous- Paleogene time. Miocene carbonate ramp and Early Messinian siliciclastic turbiditic deposits cover unconformably the previous ones. This unit is organized in anticlines associated to <b>thrust</b> <b>plane</b> trending NW-SE. Minor back thrust planes and splays with thin levels of turbiditic sandstone cropping out in their footwall, can be observed in the eastern sector of the area. M. Calvo sector, constituted by a Mesozoic carbonate platform margin sedimentary succession, is the more external part of the the Lazio-Abruzzi carbonate platform paleodomain, and it overthrusts with a low angle <b>thrust</b> <b>plane</b> onto the more external unit of La Torretta unit, that is, on its turn, made of the Meso-Cenozoic pelagic succession. The M. Calvo area is organized in several minor tectonic slides, while its footwall (La Torretta unit) shows narrow synclines and anticlines with an inclined to overturned setting. Tear faults associated to the compressive structures, trending SW-NE and E-W, are also recognized. From the Late Pliocene on, an extensional tectonic phase occurs in the studied area with the development of main normal faults and the reactivation of some ancient structures...|$|E

The proximity of some basins to Caledonian thrusts has implied that rifts locally utilized the basement fabric. New mineralogical and palaeomagnetic data show that <b>thrust</b> <b>planes</b> in the Moine Thrust Zone channelled a Pulse of hot fluid in Permian time. The fluids precipitated kaolin in fractures in the thrust zone, and with decreasing intensity away from the zone. The high-temperature polytype dickite is largely confined to major <b>thrust</b> <b>planes.</b> Stable H and 0 isotope analyses indicate that the parent fluid included meteoric water involved in a hydrothermal system. Coeval hydrothermal hematite has a chemical remanence that dates the fluid pulse as Permian. This is direct evidence for post-orogenic activity in the thrust zone, in which the thrusts vented excess heat during regional crustal extension.

By integrated methods of surface geology survey and interpretation of seismic profiles, we distinguish fold scarps located at the south limb of the Kuqatawu anticline and the north limb of the Dongqiulitag anticline in the Kuqa rejuvenation foreland thrust belt, south piedmont of central segment of the Tian- shan Mountains. Fold scarp is a newly found structural phenomenon. Because of the bend of <b>thrust</b> <b>plane</b> and the movement of hanging wall above the <b>thrust</b> <b>plane,</b> the origi- nal horizontal deposits of hanging wall and their surface become a monocline structure, resulting from the separating and migration of the active and fixed axial surfaces.

Five possible heating mechanisms to account for granulite metamorphism of supracrustal rocks are discussed: magnetic heating, thermal relaxation of perturbed temperature profiles following underthrusting of the continental crust, thermal relaxation after underthrusting of thin slivers of supracrustal rocks below continental crust of normal thickness, major preheating of the upper plate, and shear heating caused by frictional stress along the <b>thrust</b> <b>plane...</b>|$|E

The slope dip of the mountain is about 15 ^∘. There is no critical evidence that shows the <b>thrust</b> <b>plane</b> parallel to the slope of Montes Recti, but we consider that the thrust surface runs along the slope of Montes Recti because of the following reasons.

The process, which significantly reduces the frictional resistance, is the fluid overpressure, which acts against the normal pressure, thereby reducing high lithostatic pressures and allowing fracturation, cataclasis and formation of tectonic breccia or fault gouge that could act as a decollement plane.

The primary exposure revealed a broad anticlinal fold with a 2. 5 -m-high west-facing principal thrust scarp contained in fluvial cobbly gravel beds and overlying fine-grained overbank deposits.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} and quantify the Middle-Late Quaternary and ongoing deformation within the Southern Aegean fore-arc, we analyze the major tectonic structures affecting {{the island of}} Crete and its offshore. The normal faults typically consist of 4 to 30 km-long dip-slip segments locally organised in more complex systems. They separate carbonate and/or metamorphic massifs, in the footwall block, from loose to poorly consolidated alluvial and colluvial materials within the hanging-wall. All these faults show clear evidences of recent re-activations and trend parallel to two principal directions: WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW. Based on all available data for both onland and offshore structures (morphological and structural mapping, satellite imagery and airphotographs remote sensing {{as well as the}} analysis of seismic profiles and the investigation of marine terraces and Holocene raised notches along the island coasts), for each fault we estimate and constrain some of the principal seismotectonic parameters and particularly the fault kinematics, the cumulative amount of slip and the slip-rate. Following simple assumptions and empirical relationships, maximum expected magnitudes and mean recurrence periods are also suggested. Summing up the contribution to crustal extension provided by the two major fault sets we calculate both arc-normal and arc-parallel long-term strain-rates. The occurrence of slightly deeper and more external low-angle <b>thrust</b> <b>planes</b> associated with the incipient continental collision occurring in western Crete is also analysed. Although these contractional structures can generate stronger seismic events (M  7. 5.) they are probably much rarer and thus providing a minor contribution to the overall morphotectonic evolution of the island and the fore-arc. A comparison of our geologically-based results with those obtained from GPS measurements show a good agreement, therefore suggesting that the present-day crustal deformation is probably active since Middle Quaternary and mainly related to the seismic activity of upper crustal normal faults characterized by frequent shallow (< 20 km) moderate-to-strong seismic events seldom alternating with stronger earthquakes occurring along blind low-angle <b>thrust</b> <b>planes</b> probably ramping from a deeper aseismic detachment (ca. 25 km).

Therefore the thrust belt is thin-skinned and it appears to be more sensitive to the shallower Mesozoic inherited structure, generating undulations and transfer zones located at facies margins.

40|$|Abstract [...] An ophicalcite {{occurrence}} {{is recorded}} in the uppermost part of the Precambrian ophiolitic serpentinites at Gebel Mohagara (Wadi Ghadir area) in the Egyptian Eastern Desert. In this locality, the serpentinites and their ophicalcites are sometimes directly overlain by pelagic shales and calcareous sediments along <b>thrust</b> <b>planes.</b> Field relations suggest that these ophicalcites are present as serpentine-carbonate breccias that develop along conjugate shear planes and brecciation zones. Typical sedimentary features are common, such {{as the presence of}} micritic carbonate, colloform texture, geopetal-like structures and the presence of vugs. The latter are often filled by coarse calcite spars due to diagenesis and neomorphism. Another older type of less brecciated ophicarbonates (ophimagnesites) is also present and shows extensive replacement of serpentine minerals by magnesite. The ophicalcites are considered as sedimentary breccias formed in a weathered serpentinite lithology with fabrics of typical calichified rocks. It is believed that the calichified serpentinites represent a reworked oceanic calcite that have been formed after the abduction of the ophiolite nappe on the continent. The dissolution of the calcareous material in the pelagic cap furnished the needed carbonate influx to fill the brecciated serpentinit...|$|R
