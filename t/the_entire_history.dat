5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>history</b> of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>history</b> of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E
5|$|During Godwin's exile, Robert {{is said to}} {{have been}} sent by the king on an errand to William, Duke of Normandy. The reason for the embassy is uncertain. William of Jumièges says that Robert went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir. The medieval writer William of Poitiers gives the same reason, but also adds that Robert took with him as hostages Godwin's son Wulfnoth and {{grandson}} Hakon (son of Sweyn). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is silent on the visit however, so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not, or why he did so. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>history</b> of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused, and complicated by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the Norman Conquest in 1066, leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile, or if he went twice or not at all.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Junior Grade Clarence Samuels, born on Bohio, Panama, {{enlisted in}} the Coast Guard on July 16, 1920 and became a {{naturalized}} citizen of the United States on July 21, 1923. On May 12, 1939 he was appointed a chief photographer's mate becoming not only the first Hispanic of African descent photographer in the Guard, but also only the second photographer in <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>history</b> of the Service. On July 29, 1944, he assumed command of Lightship No. 115, operating in the Panama Sea Frontier. Thus, {{he became the first}} admitted Hispanic of African descent to command a cutter, as well as the first one to be an officer-in-charge of a Coast Guard vessel during wartime. Samuels entered the Coast Guard as a seaman 2nd Class and reached the rank of lieutenant (as a part of the massive demobilization of the Coast Guard following the end of hostilities, his lieutenancy was revoked and he was dis-rated to chief photographer's mate). Samuels retired from the Coast Guard on September 1, 1947.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{reinstated}} {{sanctions against}} Yugoslavia in March 1998 when the Kosovo War started. Shortly after the controversies at Račak and Rambouillet, American diplomat Richard Holbrooke traveled to Belgrade in March 1999 {{to deliver the}} final ultimatum requesting entry of UN forces into Kosovo. Milošević rejected the ultimatum, so the United States completely severed ties with Yugoslavia on March 23, 1999. Bill Clinton became the first president to declare war while bypassing a Congressional majority. The establishment of the bombing campaign was contested {{by one of the}} tightest votings (213-213) in <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>history</b> of the House of Representatives. The United States declared war on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999 to take part in Operation Allied Force led by U.S. general Wesley Clark. Out of all the territories in Yugoslavia at the time, Serbia was bombed the most due to its concentration of military targets. As a result of Slobodan Milošević granting entry to KFOR in Kosovo, the war against Yugoslavia ceased on June 10, 1999.|$|E
