40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} is {{a promising}} CCS technology {{which is being}} demonstrated prior to commercialization. While the flue gas in oxy-fuel combustion is concentrated in CO₂, it contains impurities such as SO₂. The reduction of SO₂ prior to compression by a scrubber is a common feature of oxy-fuel systems. These scrubbers use sodium solutions. The products of the sodium-based scrubber after capture of SO₂ contain Na₂SO₃ and NaHSO₃. In the presence of O₂ in the gas phase, sulphur related species (i. e., SO₃²⁻ and HSO₃⁻) in liquid phase will be irreversibly oxidized to sulphate. These sulphur related species are noted as S(IV). <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> of S(IV) could vary along {{the height of a}} spray tower due to changes in pH. The study of <b>the</b> S(IV) <b>oxidation</b> rate at different pH is helpful in evaluating <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> extent of S(IV) and understanding the impacts of S(IV) on the absorption rate of SO₂. Both <b>the</b> heterogeneous <b>oxidation</b> and <b>the</b> homogeneous <b>oxidation</b> of S(IV) were studied here using two types of experimental reactors (Gas liquid reactor and liquid reactor). Heterogeneous experiments were conducted in the gas liquid reactor. In experiments, liquid phase pH and exit SO₂ were recorded continuously.

For homogenous experiments, pH was monitored continuously and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels were manually recorded. For <b>the</b> heterogeneous <b>oxidation,</b> <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of S(IV) results in reduction in pH, at pH 5. 48, SO₂ starts to be desorbed. With this reduction in pH, <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate of S(IV) changes accordingly. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> of 0. 01 M S(IV) stays stable at pH > 5. 48. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate of S(IV) drops by 44. 5 % at pH 5. 6), <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate of S(IV) does not change with pH; in region 2 (i. e., 4. 53 < pH < 5. 6), <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate of S(IV) decreases dramatically with the decrease in pH. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate of S(IV) at pH 4. 53 is two magnitudes lower than the rate at the pH 5. 6.

In the presence of thiocyanate or bromide, NADH was oxidized to NAD+ but in the presence of iodide, an oxidation product with spectral and chemical properties distinct from NAD+ was formed. Thiocyanate, iodide and bromide appeared to function in <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of NADH by themselves being oxidized to products which in turn oxidized NADH, rather than by activating the enzyme. Iodine, which oxidized NADH non-enzymically, appeared to be an intermediate in <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of NADH in the presence of iodide. NADPH was oxidized similarly under the same conditions. An assessment was made of the rates of these oxidation reactions, together with the rates of other lactoperoxidase-catalysed reactions, at physiological concentrations of thiocyanate, iodide and bromide. The results indicated that in milk and saliva <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of thiocyanate to a bacterial inhibitor was likely to predominate over <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of NADH...|$|R

Uexamined at the MP 4 r 6 - 31 G rrMP 2 r 6 - 31 G, QCISD T r 6 - 31 G rrMP 2 r 6 - 31 GU, and B 3 -LYPr 6 - 31 GU levels of theory. The barriers for <b>the</b> <b>oxidations</b> with. dimethyldioxirane are higher up to 2. 5 kcalrmol for <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of H S than 2 those for <b>the</b> <b>oxidations</b> with <b>the</b> parent dioxirane. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> barriers for dioxirane are larger than those for <b>the</b> <b>oxidations</b> with peroxyformic acid, except the barriers for <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of sulfoxides. <b>The</b> reactivity of dimethylsulfide toward dimethyldioxirane was found to be comparable to that of. dimethylsulfoxide both in the gas phase and in solution chloroform. The classical gas phase barrier for <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> of trimethylamine to trimethylamine U. oxide was higher 6. 3 kcalrmol at the MP 4 rrMP 2 r 6 - 31 G level than that for oxygen atom transfer to trimethylphosphine.

40|$|The {{demand for}} energy {{significantly}} increases with increasing of world population and industrial activity in developing countries. Nuclear energy {{can be considered}} to make {{an important contribution to}} future demands for electricity and thermal energy. In order to continue providing inexpensive and safe energy, the operation temperatures of the next generation nuclear reactors should be remarkably increased. Consequently, the alloys used in the high temperature environment will face oxidation degradation problems. Therefore, it is critical to find ways to improve <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> resistance of <b>the</b> alloys to be used for high temperature applications. In this thesis, two potential solutions are proposed to enhance <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> resistance of three Ni-based alloys. The effect of crystallographic orientation on <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> behavior of Hastelloy 230 was investigated to evaluate if texture would affect <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> behavior of Ni-based alloys. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> rate highly depends on the grain orientation. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> resistance of grains are found to increase in the order of (100) < (110) < (111). The substrates with different grain sizes and similar textures were prepared to inspect the influence of grain sizes on <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> behavior of Hastelloy 230 and Hastelloy N. It is demonstrated that the grain size only has a small influence on <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> behavior of <b>the</b> high-Cr Hastelloy 230 while it significantly changes <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> behavior of <b>the</b> low-Cr Hastelloy N. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> mechanisms of high and low-Cr alloys with coarse and fine grain sizes are discussed. Increasing of the grain boundary density of the low-Cr alloy is believed to promote the diffusivities of Cr ions which results in the formation of a uniform Cr-rich protective oxide layer. The grain refinement process can be an efficient way to enhance <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> resistance of investigated low-Cr alloy. The effect of reactive element coating on oxidation behavior of chromium oxide forming alloy was examined. The parameters of electro-deposition process like the current density, deposition time and temperature were optimized to synthesize ceria coating. The coatings were applied to Hastelloy 230 and 625 to investigate the influence of this reactive element on <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> behavior. For both alloys, the coating significantly enhanced <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> resistance and adherence of the oxide to the substrate. The segregation of reactive element onto grain boundaries is linked to change of <b>the</b> <b>oxidation</b> mechanism from outward diffusion of cations to inward diffusion of anions. Specifically for Hastelloy 230, the addition of ceria coating changed the chromium oxide morphology from columnar to equaxied structure and that is believed to enhance the spallation resistance. In Hastelloy 625, a porous and cracked oxide layer is observed on the uncoated sample, while a layer that is protective against oxidation is formed on the coated sample. The prepared coating suppressed the formation of iron oxide. <b>The</b> <b>oxidation</b> mechanism is suggested and discussed...|$|R

Certain major trends are evident: the alkylated aromatics on initial attack either form styrene, benzyl radical or benzene.
