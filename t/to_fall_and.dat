5|$|A {{series of}} reports into the {{operation}} of the Free State were issued starting with the British Consul, Roger Casement's Casement Report and followed by reports commissioned by the Free State and Leopold II. These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a rubber plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.|$|E

At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage {{in less than an}} hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{promotion}} it received, upon release the game only reached #18 in the Dengeki charts with initial sales of 14,000 units.

According to Atlus, the game's sales {{by the end of the}} 2002-2003 fiscal year had reached 45,000 units: this fell below their planned sales number of 67,000 units. In May, Atlus announced that the development costs and poor sales of Xbox games, including Nine, had resulted in a financial loss for that year.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into four {{different}} single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage involves Mario removing eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> the hero {{to be reunited with}} Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.|$|E

After the death by natural causes of his wife Ekaterina Svanidze in November 1907, Stalin rarely returned to Tiflis. Other leading Bolsheviks in Georgia, such as Mikhail Tskhakaya and Filipp Makharadze, were largely absent from Georgia after 1907. Another prominent Tiflis Bolshevik, Stepan Shahumyan, moved to Baku. The Bolsheviks' popularity in Tiflis continued <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> by 1911, there were only about 100 Bolsheviks left in the city.|$|E
5|$|With {{war with}} Germany now a reality, Menzies sent Richard Casey to London to seek reassurances about the defence of Australia {{in the event}} that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East. In November, Australia and New Zealand were given reassurances that Singapore would not be allowed <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take {{priority}} over the Mediterranean. This seemed possible as the Kriegsmarine, the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally. Bruce, now Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left with the impression that, despite the reassurances, the Royal Navy was not strong enough to deal with simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce fell steadily, the mining boom {{of the first half}} of the 19thcentury took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant that {{the proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce continued <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, manganese, iron, antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and china clay quarries.|$|E

5|$|In the Summer of 1999, a {{group of}} volunteers worked to restore and clean up the {{cemetery}} {{that led to a}} ceremony in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance. The article in The Day highlighted the difficulty in finding the cemetery which is located {{on the banks of the}} Pachaug River, in the village of Glasgo, located in the town of Griswold. Iva Arpin said that the town would repair the stone walls and that the Children of the American Revolution would return in the spring to continue their work on the cemetery. In 2002, the cemetery had undergone a significant restoration which included the unearthing and accounting for all the burial markers that had been strewn about the grounds. Arpin noted that some of the stones showed signs of vandalism. The Day described how some of the marker stones and monuments were covered in nearly a foot of pine needles and that the roots had uprooted the anchor stones causing the headstones <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> break.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Paleogene period between 63 and 52 Ma, the last {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} British Isles were formed. As North America and Greenland separated from Europe, the Atlantic Ocean slowly formed. This led to a chain of volcanic sites west of mainland Scotland including on Skye, the Small Isles and St. Kilda, in the Firth of Clyde on Arran and Ailsa Craig and at Ardnamurchan. Sea levels began <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> {{for the first time}} the general outline of the modern British Isles was revealed. At the beginning of this period the climate was sub-tropical and erosion was caused by chemical weathering, creating characteristic features of the Scottish landscape such as the topographical basin of the Howe of Alford near Aberdeen. The vegetation of the period is known from Paleocene sedimentary deposits on Isle of Mull. The rich flora here included temperate-climate tree species such as plane, hazel, oak, Cercidiphyllum, Metasequoia and ginkgo.|$|E
5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground weights <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E

5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who {{was standing in the}} doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second door slam the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello {{and placed it on}} the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of inner London (then the County of London) {{had been in}} decline as more residents moved into the outer suburbs since its creation in 1889, and this continued after the Second World War. In contrast, the {{population of}} Middlesex had increased steadily during that period. From 1951 to 1961 {{the population of the}} inner districts of the county started <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> the population grew only in eight of the suburban outer districts. According to the 1961 census, Ealing, Enfield, Harrow, Hendon, Heston & Isleworth, Tottenham, Wembley, Willesden and Twickenham had each reached a population greater than 100,000, which would normally have entitled each of them to seek county borough status. If this status were to be granted to all those boroughs it would mean that the population of the administrative county of Middlesex would be reduced by over half, to just under one million.|$|E

The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of an}} {{endeavour}} {{to defeat}} the Ottoman Empire and force a supply route through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea, the British War Council formulated a plan to invade the Gallipoli Peninsula. On 25 April 1915, {{the men of the}} 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—landed at Anzac Cove between 05:30 and 07:30 among the second and third waves of Australian troops. The 1st Battalion was meant to be held in reserve, but due to heavy casualties and confusion the unit soon went into action. Following a request for reinforcements, Shout moved up with one of the 1st Battalion's companies to the hill feature Baby 700. Arriving at the position around 11:00, he led a party to hold the rear left flank of the hill as part of the Australians' rearguard action. The Australian position on Baby 700 had become dire by that afternoon, a situation compounded by the small number of available infantry in the area and the complete lack of artillery support, when the Turkish forces launched a counter-assault. By this time, Shout and Lieutenant Leslie Morshead of the 2nd Battalion were the only two surviving officers in their sector of the line. At 16:30, the Turks broke through the defensive line and the Australians were forced to abandon their position on the hill. Shout {{was one of the last}} to evacuate, and withdrew down towards the beach. During his retreat, Shout encountered Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, on Walker's Ridge. Braund dispatched Shout to the beach with a request for reinforcements. Shout duly relayed the message, and was immediately tasked with leading 200 stray men to reinforce the thin defensive line near Braund's position. Shout established a post at the base of the ridge as dusk began <b>to</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> his men started to dig in.|$|E
