Some British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe. The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and, if possible, extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>that</b> was studied in the research.|$|E

By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>that</b> still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E

25|$|As the Confederate Commissary-General, Northrop faced almost insurmountable {{logistical}} problems. The Southern {{economy was}} not organized for total war {{and did not}} possess the infrastructure required to generate large quantities of food, shoes, and clothing, nor to transport them for long distances.

25|$|Under {{short-circuit}} conditions, {{the calculated}} maximum prospective short-circuit current may be {{many times the}} normal, rated current of the circuit. When electrical contacts open to interrupt a large current, {{there is a tendency}} for an arc to form between the opened contacts, which would allow the current to continue. This condition can create conductive ionized gases and molten or vaporized metal, which can cause further continuation of the arc, or creation of additional short circuits, potentially resulting in the explosion of the circuit breaker and <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>that</b> it is installed in. Therefore, circuit breakers must incorporate various features to divide and extinguish the arc.|$|E
25|$|The civil {{guard was}} a 60,000-man {{paramilitary}} organization that MSUG hoped to reform into something resembling a U.S. state police outfit, an organization {{familiar to the}} professors. This would have entailed a primarily rural organization whose members would live in the communities they served. However, Saigon and the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group preferred that the civil guard be a more heavily armed paramilitary force, organized into regiments and living in garrisons, that could exercise national police duties and support the national army. As {{a result of this}} impasse, very little of <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>that</b> MSUG had planned for the civil guard was distributed until 1959, leaving the civil guard unprepared when major communist insurgency action began that same year.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the vision}} of his mentor, Prof. C. Mahadevan of Andhra University, that {{launched}} him on his doctoral studies in what later {{came to be known}} as nuclear geology.

It was the first doctoral thesis on nuclear geology in India and was examined by Arthur Holmes, F.R.S. of UK, J. Tuzo Wilson, F.R.S., of Canada, and Louis Ahrens then at Oxford. Later he did post-doctoral work on lead isotopes with Clair Patterson in Caltech in 1957, and Rb – Sr and K – Ar dating with S. Moorbath in Oxford, England, in 1963.|$|E

25|$|Academic Abdullahi El-Tom, in his {{critique}} of the book, states that the latter half {{is not nearly as}} well-argued as the heavily statistical beginning, making points that are then not substantiated and sometimes falling into polemical statements. For example, the Black Book states that <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>that</b> was to be used for the Western Highway Project was diverted to the Northern Highway Project, which is both widely rumored and believed, but no evidence is provided to back it up. El-Tom further makes the following observations: it has an implicit view of Sudan as Islamic; it emphasizes the grievances of Western Sudan (i.e. Darfur and Kordofan) over the other marginalized regions; and it has an unforgiving stance towards all the north, rather than just the three clans identified as controlling the government (i.e. the Shaigiya, the Jaaliyeen and the Danagla).|$|E
25|$|As {{a matter}} of {{principle}} a power source (such as a waterwheel) is installed {{as close as possible to}} <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>that</b> it drives (such as a water pump), to minimise the inevitable loss of power incurred in its transmission. When the distance between source and target is significant an efficient means of transferring the power is necessary, and in the 19th century the best method available was the flatrod system. This was used at a number of mines and consisted of a series of linked iron or wooden rods connected to a crank on a waterwheel (or steam engine). The crank converted the circular motion of the wheel into an oscillatory back-and-forth motion of the rods which, suitably supported, could be extended for some distance along the ground. A heavy weight, known as the balance bob, pivoted on one or both ends of the run of the rods kept them under tension and allowed the conversion of the horizontal motion to vertical motion down the shaft.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} consideration is the temperature classification of <b>the</b> electrical <b>equipment.</b> <b>The</b> surface temperature or any parts of <b>the</b> electrical <b>equipment</b> <b>that</b> may {{be exposed to}} the hazardous atmosphere should be tested that it does not exceed 80% of the auto-ignition temperature of the specific gas or vapor in the area where <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> is intended to be used.|$|R
