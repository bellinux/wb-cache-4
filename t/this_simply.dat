5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. <b>This,</b> <b>simply</b> put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if he felt he was getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E

25|$|Decreased fish stock {{during the}} 1990s {{resulted}} in more strict handling of violations. At the same time cooperation with neighboring countries improved. Greenlandic fishermen started fishing in the fisheries protection zones in 1991.

They claimed the protection zone was not valid {{in accordance with the}} Svalbard Treaty. The issue peaked on 5 August 1994, when Senja seized an Icelandic trawler. In 1997 the Coast Guard carried out 2,192 inspections, issued 566 warnings and seized 18 vessels.|$|E

[...] The following year, the legislature undertook a thorough revision of the laws relating to boroughs, and forbade incorporations, dissolutions, or boundary changes without its leave. <b>This</b> <b>simply</b> moved the venue for conflicts over schools from local referenda to the corridors of the State House in Trenton. Boroughs continued to be incorporated by legislative act, with a major burst in the 1920s. [...] These 20th century increases {{in the number of}} boroughs were sometimes caused by conflicts over road funds, causing Caldwell Township, Essex County, to divide into six municipalities by 1908, and with Clementon Township, Camden County fracturing into nine between 1915 and 1929.|$|E

500|$|While it {{eventually}} became a bestseller in the United States, The Red Badge of Courage was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when {{it was published in}} late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: [...] "I have only one pride {{and that is that the}} English edition of The Red Badge of Courage has been [...] with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of <b>this</b> <b>simply</b> because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win." [...] Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a [...] "masterpiece", applauding Crane's ability to [...] "stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre." [...] Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that [...] "If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, Émile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be [...] "positively... cold and ineffectual" [...] when compared to The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E
500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November4, 2007, by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost fourth season had been written. [...] These episodes aired from January to March 2008. [...] After the strike ended on February12, 2008, the writers {{found that there was}} only enough time to produce five episodes, {{although}} the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodes—and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six, with some carrying over into the fifth season. [...] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "we are going to execute our full story plan for season four. [...] <b>This</b> <b>simply</b> requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. [...] It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on the gas pedal... so, hold on to your hats. [...] Those of you waiting for the long-anticipated [...] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed." [...] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes, but ABC did not comply and [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] served as the mid-season premiere. [...] The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, {{and they were able to}} respond to confusion from the audience. [...] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard [...] "languid, contemplative material" [...] and felt [...] "recharged [...] a real energy to attack [...] last six episodes". [...] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada; the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy. [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and the following three episodes were broadcast on Thursdays at 10:00p.m., after Grey's Anatomy.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{rebellion}} have {{been the source of}} much discussion and theories among modern scholars. Moving away from the personal relationship between al-Hajjaj and Ibn al-Ash'ath, Alfred von Kremer suggested that the rebellion was linked with the efforts of the non-Arab converts to Islam (the mawālī) to secure equal rights with the Arab Muslims. Julius Wellhausen rejected this view as the main source of the revolt, seeing it instead as a reaction of the Iraqis in general and the ashrāf in particular against the Syrian regime of the Umayyads as represented by the overbearing (and notably low-born) al-Hajjaj. Other scholars have seen in it a manifestation of the tribal factionalism between the northern Arab and southern Arab ("Yamani") tribal groups prevalent at the time. Thus a poem by a certain A'sha Hamdan in celebration of the rebellion shows not only a religious but also a tribal motivation of the rebel troops: al-Hajjaj is denounced as an apostate and a [...] "friend of the devil", while Ibn al-Ash'ath is portrayed as the champion of the Yamani Qahtani and Hamdani tribes against the northern Arab Ma'addis and Thaqafis. On the other hand, as G. R. Hawting points out, this is insufficient evidence to ascribe purely tribal motivations to the revolt: if Ibn al-Ash'ath's movement was indeed led largely by Yamanis, <b>this</b> <b>simply</b> reflects {{the fact that they were}} the dominant element in Kufa, and while al-Hajjaj himself was a northerner, his main commander was a southerner. Wellhausen's analysis, furthermore, ignored the evident religious dimension of the revolt, especially the participation of the fanatical zealots known as qurrāʾ ("Quran readers"). While the [...] "religious polemic used by both sides [...] is stereotyped, unspecific and to be found in other contexts", according to C. G. Hawting, there do appear to have been specific religious grievances, notably the accusation that the Umayyads were neglecting the ritual prayer. It seems [...] that the revolt began as a simple mutiny against an overbearing governor who made impossible demands of the troops, but, at least by the time the army reached Fars, a religious element had emerged, represented by the qurrāʾ. Given the close [...] "interaction of religion and politics in early Muslim society", as G. R. Hawting points out, the religious element quickly became dominant, as seen by the difference between the oath of allegiance (bayʿa) sworn at the beginning of the revolt and that exchanged between the army and Ibn al-Ash'ath at Istakhr in Fars. While in the first Ibn al-Ash'ath declared as his intention to [...] "depose al-Hajjaj, the enemy of God", in the latter, he exhorted his men to [...] " [...] the Book of God and the Sunna of His Prophet, to depose the imāms of error, to fight against those who regard [...] as licit". Although Ibn al-Ash'ath remained as the head of the uprising, Veccia Vaglieri writes that after this point [...] "one has the impression that [...] the control of the revolt slipped from his hands", or that, as Wellhausen comments, [...] "he was urged on in spite of himself, and even if he would, could not have banished the spirits which he had called up. It was as if an avalanche came rushing down sweeping every thing before it".|$|E
