5|$|Beyond the band's {{specific}} {{legal issues}} and {{insight into the}} making of the new album, the film also examines the state of the modern music industry as a whole, focusing on the complex relationships between major labels and their artists. Other musicians give their first-hand accounts of their own experiences in the business. The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry insiders, including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists. They trace the impact of the growing American economic recession on the industry, wherein many companies were taken over by larger groups who thought they could save <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> instance, Terra Firma Capital Partners sought to rescue EMI despite having little experience in music management.|$|E
5|$|FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} cases {{linked to}} the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder believes in paranormal phenomena, while the skeptical Scully attempts to discredit <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> episode, the pair investigate a possible conspiracy in the US Air Force and Mulder meets a mysterious informant who warns him {{to stay away from}} the case. Undeterred, Mulder continues and comes closer to the truth about extraterrestrial life than ever before, only to have his progress taken away from him again.|$|E

He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E

5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E
5|$|The ants {{were also}} {{observed}} {{to use their}} jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat. Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position by an internal mechanism. Energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organs resembling hairs {{on the inside of}} the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks. Trap-jaws also are seen in the following genera: Anochetus, Orectognathus, and Strumigenys, plus some members of the Dacetini tribe, which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{approaches are}} applied by interpreters {{specifically to the}} book of Revelation, but Revelation occupies such a central place in Christian eschatology that it is worth mentioning <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> more general, overview.

25|$|A 2002 {{review of}} the RNZN's {{abilities}} found that the navy was not meeting its patrol capability requirements; one of the contributing factors was that the New Zealand Anzacs were both too few and overcapable for EEZ patrols, and deploying <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> manner prevented them from more effective use elsewhere.
