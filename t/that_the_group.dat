5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in October 2012. It {{features}} hip hop-inspired dance moves choreographed by renowned American choreographers Nappytabs. It won the award for Video of the Year at the first YouTube Music Awards in 2013, which generated much attention for beating other popular nominees like Justin Bieber and Psy despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was considered lesser-known to the Western audience at the time.|$|E
5|$|Anarchist writer Bob Black, {{a former}} member, has criticized the Church, alleging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{has come to}} be {{characterized}} by conformism and submission to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper Bedfordshire on Sunday after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) is {{approached}} at her new job by a colleague, who {{reveals that}} the company is part of the Odessa network. Meanwhile, Black visits Catherine's boss Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office. Later that night Black is visited by Means and the Old Man (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> has, throughout history, been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. The Old Man also explains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network—a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{embarked}} on a six-week stint across the U.S. and parts of Canada opening for HIM, with the arduous year of touring finally reaching an end with shows in New York City, on December 1 and December 2, 2007, while HIM was simply done touring North America and set {{to move on to}} Europe.|$|E

The label went defunct in June 2004.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|However, during Act V, {{there is}} no mention of Egeus, nor does he have a {{speaking}} role. It is logical, however, that he would have been in attendance since it is also his daughter Hermia's wedding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> if there to celebrate.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> containing the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago.
