5|$|St Andrew's {{has been}} their home ground since 1906. They have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours, {{with whom they}} play the Second City derby.

5|$|City were relegated again {{five seasons}} later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the 1928–29 season, they broke several club records to earn {{promotion}} back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they {{remained in the}} third and fourth tiers of the English football league system until 1985–86. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered a disastrous fire in which 56people died, on a day the club and <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> were supposed to be celebrating promotion.|$|E

5|$|Following a short tour in March 2009 with Ceremony, Coliseum, Pulling Teeth, Rise and Fall, Converge {{entered the}} studio to begin {{recording}} in May 2009. During this short tour, the band debuted a few new songs live, and footage could be seen online. The album was self-produced by Converge's guitar player, Kurt Ballou, in his own GodCity Studios located in Massachusetts. Ballou has produced and co-produced several Converge albums. Throughout the recording process, the band updated <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> via Twitter of their progress in the studio.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of exhaustion and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, replacing them with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bands of}} the NWOBHM {{had the same}} look as <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> and {{produced}} rock shows without special visual effects. A notable exception was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career. Other exceptions were Demon, Cloven Hoof and Samson, which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while Pagan Altar and Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.|$|E

5|$|One Arsenal supporter, Paul Dineen {{was stabbed}} {{in the back with}} a knife, during the riots in a pub, near the City Hall Square. The {{incident}} caused Arsenal to offer <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> full compensation, if {{they did not want to}} travel and attend the match. Another three members of the public, identified as one Englishman, Turk and Dutchman were also wounded by knifing when the event was still under its way. Sixty people, all presumed to have been involved, were detained by Danish law enforcement, while another 19 suffered injuries as a result of the violence.|$|E
5|$|The UEFA Super Cup is {{an annual}} contest played between the {{previous}} season's UEFA Champions League (formerly the European Cup) and UEFA Europa League (formerly UEFA Cup) winners. The first final, played over two legs between Dutch team Ajax and Glasgow's Rangers is considered unofficial by UEFA. Rangers were banned from European competition {{due to the}} behaviour of <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> but, having won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup the previous season, contested the title. Ajax lifted the trophy {{under the guidance of}} Romanian manager Ștefan Kovács, winning 6–3 over the two legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry with}} Liverpool {{is rooted in}} {{competition}} between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port. Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and, at many points in their history, they have battled {{each other for the}} league title (most recently in the 2008–09 season). Their matches are usually considered by the players and <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> as the biggest in any given season.|$|E
50|$|In modern anime, fan {{service has}} often been {{received}} with varied reviews. While some series, like Fate/Zero, have received positive reviews for <b>their</b> <b>fan</b> service interposed with humorous effect or an overall good story, others, such as Rosario + Vampire, Code Geass, and Highschool of the Dead, have often been panned for <b>their</b> <b>fan</b> service, which is often seen as unnecessary, distracting and out of place.|$|R

5|$|Tool {{was founded}} in 1988 by vocalist Maynard James Keenan and guitarist Adam Jones, who then {{recruited}} drummer Danny Carey and bassist Paul D'Amour. They initially released a demo EP in 1991 called 72826. Although demos are typically intended only for record labels, the band was so pleased with theirs that they sold copies to <b>their</b> <b>fans.</b> Tool signed to Zoo Entertainment just three months into their career, and released their first studio EP, Opiate, in March 1992. After touring to positive reviews, they released their first full-length album, Undertow, in April 1993. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Tsiranana's ouster {{ushered in}} the socialist Second Republic under Admiral Didier Ratsiraka in 1975, but the {{ineffectiveness}} of the regime's philosophy soon fomented popular disillusionment. Persistent in their exposure of political problems like corruption and abuse of power under Ratsiraka, Mahaleo repeatedly saw their songs banned from the radio. The band successfully countered efforts at censorship by encouraging <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> to produce and distribute bootlegged recordings of their concerts. They continued to gain in popularity, regularly performing live shows across Madagascar and launching frequent tours {{to play for the}} Malagasy diaspora in major French population centers like Paris, Toulouse and Marseille.|$|E
5|$|After the Canadiens were {{eliminated}} {{for the third}} straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante's inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare that for the 1963–64 season either he or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He retired in 1965 while playing for the minor-league Baltimore Clippers of the American Hockey League. His wife was ill at the time, and he required surgery on his right knee.|$|E

5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} accommodated {{in the corner}} of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry {{and the players}} became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements {{in the months that}} followed, and the club's 13th place finish in Division Two in 1985–86 was hailed a major achievement. During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after <b>their</b> <b>fans</b> set fire to a chip van at Odsal Stadium. McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United. Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986–87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, Youkilis {{accepted}} {{a one-year contract}} worth $12 million to play third base for the New York Yankees. Though Youkilis had not been popular {{with members of the}} Yankees and <b>their</b> <b>fans,</b> Robinson Canó and Alex Rodriguez publicly supported the signing, and Joba Chamberlain reached out to Youkilis in an attempt to smooth over their past differences. The deal became official on December 14. Youkilis was diagnosed with a back strain when the 2013 season began and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 30, 2013. He was activated and returned on May 30, 2013. He was placed back on the disabled list on June 14, 2013 after restraining his back. He then underwent season-ending surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back on June 20, 2013.|$|E
