25|$|The name National Ignition Facility {{refers to}} the goal of igniting the fusion fuel, a long-sought {{threshold}} in fusion research. In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually {{in order to keep the}} reactions going. Ignition {{refers to the}} point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> against all losses of energy, so that fusion reactions can continue. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear burn. Ignition is considered a key requirement if fusion power is to ever become practical.|$|E
30|$|A LOCA is an {{accident}} which occurs {{due to a}} break in a reactor coolant system (RCS) pipeline in a NPP. LOCAs {{are considered to be}} serious accidents because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> core meltdown. As the reactor coolant drains out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RCS, <b>the</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> rods increase due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> coolant.

25|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{can only}} maintain criticality {{if they are}} mechanically sound. If the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bundles increases {{to the point where}} they are mechanically unstable, their horizontal layout means they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. If this process further weakens the fuel bundles, they will eventually bend far enough to touch the calandria tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own, and is normally kept relatively cool.|$|E
25|$|During a meltdown, the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> rods {{increases}} {{and they can}} deform, {{in the case of}} Zircaloy cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the fuel rods ruptures the control rod cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of zircaloy oxidized. Hydrogen embrittlement may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged fuel rods. Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of control rod cladding. At 1800°C (3,272 °F), the cladding oxides melt and begin to flow. At 2700–2800°C (4,892-5,072 °F) the uranium oxide fuel rods melt and the reactor core structure and geometry collapses. This can occur at lower temperatures if a eutectic uranium oxide-zirconium composition is formed. At that point, the corium is virtually free of volatile constituents that are not chemically bound, resulting in correspondingly lower heat production (by about 25%) as the volatile isotopes relocate.|$|E

50|$|MCFC’s use {{a liquid}} {{electrolyte}} (molten carbonate) which consists of a sodium(Na) and potassium(K) carbonate. This electrolyte {{is supported by a}} ceramic (LiAlO2) matrix to contain the liquid between the electrodes. <b>The</b> high <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> cell is required to produce sufficient ionic conductivity of oxygen through this electrolyte. Common MCFC electrolytes contain 62% Li2CO3 and 38% K2CO3. A greater fraction of Li carbonate is used due to its higher ionic conductivity but is limited to 62% due to its lower gas solubility and ionic diffusivity of oxygen. In addition, Li2CO3 is a very corrosive electrolyte and this ratio <b>of</b> carbonates provides <b>the</b> lowest corrosion rate. Due to these issues, recent studies have delved into replacing the potassium carbonate with a sodium carbonate.
