50|$|In 2008, a {{feasibility}} study {{was carried out}} and proposals were put forward {{on behalf of the}} East Riding of Yorkshire Council for an alternative crossing of the River Derwent at Stamford Bridge. The current Grade II listed bridge only allows for one way flow and is controlled by traffic lights. It has a record for causing peak hour delays during the working week. Alternative routes included utilising the disused York to Beverley railway line crossing downstream from the current bridge. Also adding a new structure right next to the existing bridge was put forward. Other proposals involved two routes {{to the north of the}} river, one crossing just north of the caravan site on Buttercrambe Road and the other a complete new by-pass missing the village altogether. The report concluded that the best options did not score well enough for the Regional Transport Board to take forward and should not be pursued.A submission to the ERYC mentions 'A consultant's report that examined the options for Stamford Bridge was seriously flawed in the assessment process and additionally failed <b>to</b> <b>detail</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of a full bypass'.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1960 s, the Beer Distribution Game (BDG) {{has been used}} to {{characterize}} the various instabilities that arise in multi-stage supply chains. Although an appreciable body of research exists for the BDG and its inherent nonlinear instabilities, there are three apparent technical voids in literature that have been addressed in this dissertation, including: characterizing the difference between discrete- and continuous-valued BDG implementations, characterizing various aspects of the transient behavior of the BDG, and characterizing the impact of both heterogeneously- and homogeneously-implemented Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies on the nonlinear dynamics of the BDG. This dissertation utilizes numerical simulations, previously-validated data sifting methods, and an ordering heuristic known to mimic human decision making behavior to examine each topic. A high-throughput computing approach to the BDG allowed for, what is believed to be, the most computationally intensive investigation of the BDG to date. ^ This dissertation seeks to fill the first apparent void by examining the nonlinear behavior of four distinct BDG models: a continuous-variable implementation and three discrete implementations, incorporating conventional, nearest-integer rounding, floor functions, and ceiling functions, respectively. Specifically, numerical simulations and previous-validated data sifting methods are utilized <b>to</b> <b>detail</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> and system response characteristics associated with each game implementation. The acquired results are subsequently compared to one another and used to derive refined ordering policies, which have distinct applicability to the operation of low volume supply chains of indivisible products. The in-depth numerical investigation is followed by a set of agent based simulations that utilize a reinforcement learning technique to learn optimal rounding methods. These rounding methods consist of various combinations of the aforementioned rounding functions and easily defined agent system states, which are based on ordering characteristics and operating costs. These simulations illustrate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning techniques in learning optimal behaviors for a highly nonlinear, often aperiodic, multi-stage supply chain model. ^ This dissertation seeks to address the second apparent void by examining the transient performance metrics (e. g. settling time, average settling time cost, total setting time cost, and number of stock outages) associated with the prototypical supply chain model – the BDG. Managerial insights, which both support and contradict common practice, were derived from the data distributions created through extensive simulations. ^ Process automation and information sharing are becoming increasingly important to the successful operation of supply chains. While previous works have investigated the effects of RFID, EDI, and other transparency technologies on multi-stage supply chain models, the studies completed to date have not fully examined the implications of these technologies on the dynamic behavior of the BDG. This is especially true for supply chains which feature heterogeneously-implemented transparency technologies. This dissertation seeks to fill this apparent technical void, by characterizing the impact of both heterogeneously- and homogeneously-implemented EDI and RFID technologies on the nonlinear dynamics of the BDG. To achieve this, the high-throughput numerical simulations are utilized to characterize the effects of EDI and RFID on the aforementioned transient performance metrics to form a series of succinct conclusions on the relative utility of these technologies. ...|$|E

30|$|Similar {{arguments}} {{should apply}} to the two dimensions that pertain <b>to</b> <b>details</b> of <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> and risks associated with migration. If a household relocation is necessary, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of <b>the</b> search for adequate housing opportunities becomes part of <b>the</b> relocation <b>cost</b> (Oswald 1996, 1999). Empirically, {{this is important because}} regions with good employment opportunities are often those where housing is expensive. If the gains in job mobility are thwarted by <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of renting a dwelling, the job offer becomes less preferable. Thus, the greater the expected difficulty of finding adequate housing is, the less likely it is that the job will be accepted. Finally, individuals are typically uncertain whether new job options will result in good, stable matches. Once hired by a new employer, an employee may find that the job characteristics do not suit him or her, or the employer may not be satisfied with the employee’s performance. Therefore, a possibility remains that the employment contract will be terminated. In this case, all of the mobility expenses would be lost, at least {{in the case of the}} employee having difficulty finding another job in the new location. Consequently, a job offer becomes more attractive if there are better local employment opportunities at the new employer’s location (DaVanzo 1978). We expect employed individuals to be more concerned with these risk factors, meaning that both dimensions should interact with the employment status (H 3 b) and the length of unemployment (H 4 b).|$|R

Comparing the simplified model <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> well <b>cost</b> model shows that <b>the</b> simple linear <b>cost</b> model provides a very efficient tool for screening certain new drilling methods, techniques, and technologies based on economic value.

To validate the code, a series of test cases {{was developed in the}} CALVIN V 3. 0 Validation Test Plan (CRWMS M&O 1999 a) that exercises the principal calculation models and options of CALVIN V 3. 0. Twenty-five test cases were developed: 18 logistics test cases and 7 cost test cases. These cases test the features of CALVIN in a sequential manner, so that the validation of each test case is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the input to subsequent calculations. Where necessary, the test cases utilize reduced-size data tables to make the hand calculations used to verify the results more tractable, while still adequately testing the code's capabilities. Acceptance criteria, were established for <b>the</b> logistics and <b>cost</b> test cases in the Validation Test Plan (CRWMS M&O 1999 a). The Logistics test cases were developed to test the following CALVIN calculation models: Spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and reactivity calculations; Options for altering reactor life; Adjustment of commercial SNF (CSNF) acceptance rates for fiscal year calculations and mid-year acceptance start; Fuel selection, transportation cask loading, and shipping to the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR); Transportation cask shipping to and storage at an Interim Storage Facility (ISF); Reactor pool allocation options; and Disposal options at the MGR. Two types of cost test cases were developed: cases <b>to</b> validate <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> transportation <b>costs,</b> and cases to validate <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> associated with <b>the</b> Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System (CRWMS) Management and Operating Contractor (M&O) and Regional Servicing Contractors (RSCs). For each test case, values calculated using Microsoft Excel 97 worksheets were compared to CALVIN V 3. 0 scenarios with the same input data and assumptions. All of the test case results compare with the CALVIN V 3. 0 results within the bounds of the acceptance criteria. Therefore, it is concluded that the CALVIN V 3. 0 calculation models and options tested in this report are validated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{detailed}} and serious cost calculation is {{a precondition for}} a competitive offer of railway traffic services in future. This task does not only concern the Train Operating Companies (TOCs), but also the Infrastructure Managers (IMs) when transferring <b>the</b> infrastructure <b>costs</b> into track access charges. These charges are subject to discussions since they were foreseen in the European regulations back in the 1990 -ies the first time. The principle, to charge the “cost that is directly incurred {{as a result of}} operating the train service”, lead to numerous different interpretation throughout Europe. Beside the legislation, it is still the objective of the IM to calculate <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for <b>the</b> single train. Averaged charges based on gross-tonne-kilometres are definitely no proper estimation. It is essential to base the charge on three levels. The first level is the network-section or line. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> of Railway's permanent way differ very much on the given boundary conditions. Curved, mountainous sections come up with costs that are very likely up to three times higher compared to straight sections. Averaging costs network-wide leads to unfair conditions. Modulating gross-tonne-based charges due to the line conditions is the first necessary attempt in order to calculate “directly incurred costs”. A proper cost accounting system provides all necessary input data. The second step has to be seen from the view of the competiveness of railway freight transport. Just allocating costs does not include the cost-by-cause principle. The infrastructure is designed and maintained to the highest needs of the collective of all users. One example is the quality of track geometry that generates much higher costs if only one train is operated on high speed. These high costs are distributed to all trains if simply allocating it to gross-tonnage. Turnouts are a second major cost driver. As only <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> level is given by the accounting system, this steps needs a modelling process. Calculating gross-tonne-costs on a defined quality level is possible using detailed cost analyses for different assets at different quality standards. This second step makes it possible to calculate a cost level for freight operation, not covering <b>the</b> additional <b>costs</b> of fast or regional passenger services, and is therefore a pre-condition for a competitive railway freight service in a tight market situation. Last but not least, the quality of rolling stock {{is an essential part of}} <b>the</b> generated infrastructure <b>costs.</b> <b>The</b> forces of the rail-wheel-contact define the wear and damage process on the track involving <b>the</b> maintenance <b>cost</b> to be charged. It needs a sound track deterioration model to calculate <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> relevance of different forces. This modulation is an important step towards lower overall <b>costs</b> of <b>the</b> total railway system, as optimisation of subsystems is eliminated. In the end, Track Access Charges must be calculated on a much more detailed level in order to cover the goals defined by the cost-by-cause principle and a non-discriminatory access to railway infrastructure. Most of the necessary data are existing, it needs <b>to</b> transform <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>cost</b> calculation <b>to</b> a manageable charging system...|$|R
