5|$|Although Edward reigned {{for only}} {{six years and}} {{died at the age}} of 15, his reign made a lasting {{contribution}} to the English Reformation and the structure of the Church of England. The last decade of Henry VIII's reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to more conservative values. By contrast, Edward's reign saw radical progress in the Reformation. In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Roman Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant. In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's Forty-two Articles formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day. Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E

25|$|Unger looks {{closely at}} existential {{projects}} that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic (Buddhism, which tries but cannot divest itself of the world). Both respond to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual not being {{the center of}} the world. However, by doing so they disengage from the world and others. While Confucianism addresses interdependence, the philosophy elevates it to a level of canonical hierarchy and thus imposes strict constraints.|$|E

25|$|On {{the western}} periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia.

25|$|A {{charge of}} murder was brought against him, and a {{commission}} was issued to try it. The case came {{on at the}} Old Bailey, in London, before Baron Burland, on 11 December 1774. Roche's counsel declined {{to rely on the}} former acquittal at the Cape of Good Hope, and the case was again gone through. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killing was undisputed, but from the peculiar nature of the proceedings, there could not be, as in a common indictment for murder, a conviction for manslaughter; and the judge directed the jury, if they did not believe the killing to be malicious and deliberate, absolutely to acquit the prisoner.

25|$|When this sea, {{called the}} Littorina Sea, the {{ancestor}} of the Baltic Sea, withdrew, the Dalälven found itself blocked at Avesta {{by one of}} these eskers formed by the ice sheet: Badelundaåsen. In effect, before the ice age, the river continued {{in the direction of}} the Mälaren, in which it emptied itself and it so had flooded a valley along this entire section. Because of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence of this obstacle, it was forced to head northeast. So, in the whole section of the Lower Dalälven, the river did not have the time to flood a true valley. It thus had to adapt itself to the topology of the terrain, forming large fjärds with many isles in the flattest sections and by contrast a course narrower and faster at the different eskers encountered along the way.|$|E
25|$|Straffen {{then made}} a long statement, which the police checked. On 1 May, Straffen was charged {{with the murder of}} Linda Bowyer, and he {{appeared}} at Reading County Magistrates' Court the following day. He was remanded in custody, and despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order committing him to Broadmoor, the magistrates decided that, since they had failed to hold him, he should be remanded to Brixton Prison. The Ministry of Health meanwhile called for a full inquiry into how Straffen had escaped. A group of local residents held a meeting on the same evening as Straffen's court appearance to call for some system of public warning of an escape. The Ministry of Health inquiry was extended to a full independent inquiry. A system of warning sirens was set up later in 1952 {{as a result of the}} inquiry recommendations.|$|E
25|$|The {{extrinsic}} grounds {{were said}} to be in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implicit approval of the Holy See given to the constant practice of unconditionally ordaining former Anglican priests who desired to be priests in the Roman Catholic Church and, also, in the explicit declarations of the Holy See as to the invalidity of Anglican orders on every occasion when its decision was given. According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, to attempt to confer orders a second time on the same person would be a sacrilege. Rome, by knowingly allowing the practice of ordaining former Anglican priests, supposed that their orders were invalid. The bull points out that orders received in the Church of England, according to the change introduced into the Ritual under King Edward VI, were thought to be invalid by the Roman Catholic Church. This was not through a custom grown up gradually, but from the date of that change in the ritual.|$|E

25|$|Croatia had a {{alarming}} {{start to}} the 2003 season with a devastating streak of five defeats and an early departure from the Open Canada Cup from a 4-2 loss to Toronto Supra. As a result Santic was relieved from his coaching duties and Velemir Crljen returned in his previous capacity as player/coach. Crljen utilized the clubs overseas connections {{in order to bring}} the necessary imports to improve the teams situation. The imports included Josip Juric, Antonijo Zupan, Jure Pavic, Ivica Raguz, and Ante Pavlovic. The additions proved to play a factor as Toronto was able to recover from their slump and clinch a postseason berth by finishing third in their conference. In {{the first round of the}} playoffs they faced the Brampton Hitmen, where they finished victorious after a 4-3 victory in a penalty shootout. To Croatia's dismay the result was overturned by the league after Brampton filed a protest over <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> usage of two suspended Croatian officials in a match. At the conclusion of the season Domagoj Sain received his second Defender of the Year award.|$|E
25|$|During the attack, an Iraqi {{doctor who}} was {{next door to}} the police station was alerted to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six RMPs being under siege and drove to the edge of town in an {{ambulance}} where a Major from 1 Para had established an Incident Control Point (ICP). He informed the Paratroopers of the RMPs plight at about midday local time and conveyed to the Paratroopers that the RMPs were being held hostage. At 12:30pm, Dr. Fasal returned to the ICP and informed Major Kemp that three of the British were dead. By now, with all 1 Para troops accounted for, the staff in the Ops Room were wondering who they could be and realized that they must be the six-man RMP section. By the time the doctor had returned to the police station, all of the RMPs were dead, and for a third time, he returned to the checkpoint with the bad news. Later, Dr. Fasal brought all of the bodies out to the checkpoint and handed them over to the British.|$|E
25|$|Although never envisaged as a park, JC Loudon {{devised the}} {{original}} planting scheme {{that was not}} fully realised. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. Each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin, broad-leaf pea and ferns. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for Market gardens, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. In Autumn, {{there can be a}} display of fungi, a mycologist's trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and several families of foxes. Among the birds, there are many garden species with the addition of green woodpeckers and occasionally, kestrels. The macaws are only visitors.|$|E

25|$|Leinster: Likewise, {{despite the}} adverse (and unforeseen) effects of Diarmait Mac Murchada's efforts {{to regain his}} kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter was that, of his twenty {{successor}}s up to 1632, {{most of them had}} regained much of the ground they had lost to the Normans, and exacted yearly tribute from the towns. His most dynamic successor was the celebrated Art mac Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh. The Ó Broin and Ó Tuathail largely contented themselves with raids on Dublin (which, incredibly, continued into the 18th century). The Ó Mordha of Laois and Ó Conchobhair Falaighe of Offaly – the latter's capital was Daingean – were two self-contained territories that had earned the right to be called kingdoms due to their near-invincibility against successive generations of Anglo-Irish. The great losers were the Ó Melaghlins of Meath: their kingdom collapsed despite attempts by Cormac mac Art O Melaghlain to restore it. The royal family was reduced to vassal status, confined to the east shores of the River Shannon. The kingdom was substantially incorporated into the Lordship of Meath which was granted to Hugh de Lacy in 1172.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embassy {{cannot be}} doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near {{the south shore}} of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E
25|$|Rejecting a {{work is a}} {{very serious}} action and one which we do not take lightly. Where {{possible}} we try to consider cuts or, in the case of games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's published Guidelines. In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible. Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing. There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism {{in the way in which}} these killings are committed, and encouraged, in the game. Although the difference should not be exaggerated <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer, together with the different overall narrative context, contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game. That work was classified '18' in 2003, before the BBFC's recent games research had been undertaken, but was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category. Against this background, the Board's carefully considered view is that to issue a certificate to Manhunt 2, on either platform, would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks, to both adults and minors, within the terms of the Video Recordings Act, and accordingly that its availability, even if statutorily confined to adults, would be unacceptable to the public.|$|E
