40|$|Insomnia among workers {{reduces the}} quality of life, {{contributes}} toward the economic burden of healthcare costs and losses in work performance. The relationship between occupational stress and insomnia {{has been reported in}} previous studies, but there has been little attention to temperament in occupational safety and health research. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify the relationships between temperament, occupational stress, and insomnia. The subjects were 133 Japanese daytime local government employees. Temperament was assessed using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-Auto questionnaire (TEMPS-A). Occupational stress was assessed using the Generic Job Stress Questionnaire (GJSQ). Insomnia was assessed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted. In a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was found that the higher subdivided stress group by "role conflict" (OR = 5. 29, 95 % CI, 1. 61 - 17. 32) and anxious temperament score (OR = 1. 33; 95 % CI, 1. 19 - 1. 49) was associated with the presence of insomnia using an adjusted model, whereas other factors were excluded from the model. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>were</b> the sample size and the fact that only Japanese local government employees were surveyed. This study demonstrated the relationships between workers' anxious temperament, role conflict, and insomnia. Recognizing one's own anxious temperament would lead to self-insight, and the recognition of anxious temperament and reduction of role conflict by their supervisors or coworkers would reduce the prevalence of insomnia among workers in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe {{mental health}} care {{environment}} is a stressful environment because of the environment, perceived unpreparedness of students and the emotional demands placed on the students which are inherent {{in the nature of}} the work. The use of the self as a therapeutic tool also presents challenges for students. Whilst researchers have identified supportive interventions and strategies to address students support needs in {{mental health care}} settings, these interventions/strategies focus on meeting clinical learning objectives with the assumption that if the student learning needs are met, they will feel emotionally supported. Literature and experience indicates that it is imperative that in this field of study, students should be prepared to cope emotionally with the demands of mental health work. The aim of this research was to develop a model of emotional support for student nurses working in mental health care settings. A theory-generating design based on a qualitative, explorative and descriptive research approach was used to achieve the aim of the study. Purposive sampling was employed to select participants namely: students, educators and clinical staff who met the eligibility criteria. A sample of 40 students, nine educators and nine clinical staff who worked in the four psychiatric hospitals and community mental health clinics in the Western Cape participated in the study. Data collection was by means of focus group interviews (students) and indepth individual interviews (educators and clinical staff). Data was analysed by means of Tesch’s method of content analysis. The model was developed by means of the four steps of the theory generation process. Step one was concept development which consisted of two sub-steps namely concept identification and concept definition. A total of 22 concepts were identified which was further synthesised into six main concepts. The main concepts which were used to develop the model were: positive self-concept; positive work environment; academic and professional development; effective communication; formal and informal supportive interventions and collaboration between the Higher Education Institution and the mental health care setting. Step two of the theory generating process was model development. These main concepts were placed in relation with each other which formed an emotional support model for students working in mental health care settings. Step three was model description. The model was described using the three phases of interpersonal communication namely orientation phase, working phase and the termination phase. A visual application of the model which depicts the main concepts, the process and the context was shown. Step four dealt with the development of the guidelines for the implementation of the emotional support model. A critical reflection of the model was done using five criteria for model evaluation according to Chinn & Kramer. Trustworthiness of the data was ensured by means of applying Guba’ model of truth value, applicability, consistency and neutrality. Reflexivity was used by the researcher to further enhance trustworthiness. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the relevant authorities.

This study analyses, according to gender and educational level, the prevalence of smoking, in order to highlight the relationship between sociocultural status and smoking.

40|$|Data from {{a survey}} of tobacco use {{conducted}} in 2001 {{was used to examine}} if Florida’s youth-focused anti-tobacco media campaign, which focused on cigarette smoking, reached adults. The majority of the sample was white (87 %), high school or college edu- cated (85 %), and over half with children (56 %). Differences in awareness and intentions to quit among adult smokers with and without children were examined. About 50 % of adults were aware of the campaign and the awareness of the tobacco industry manipula- tion theme was associated with intentions to quit, independent of having children. These findings provide evidence that youth-targeted anti-tobacco media campaigns can reach adults; however, to change the behavior of adults who smoke, it may not be appropriate to have a “one-size-fits-all” program. <b>The</b> <b>study’s</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>are</b> noted...|$|R

To better understand the processes of peer influence and peer selection, in a field study 106 Ecstasy users (67 M/ 39 F, average age 25. 4 years) were interviewed face-to-face in Amsterdam in 2005. In the initiation of Ecstasy use, peer influence emerged as the dominating mechanism; peer selection was uncommon. In the continuation of Ecstasy use, peer influence and peer selection occurred reciprocally in a dynamic process, although peer influence made a greater relative contribution.

Forty-two schizophrenia outpatients participated and were divided into three groups: cannabis abstainers, moderate users, and daily users. Patients with any substance use disorder other than cannabis abuse/dependence, or patients meeting criteria for schizotypal, schizoaffective, affective, anxiety, delusional, or personality disorders were excluded from <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> All patients completed a self-constructed questionnaire assessing demographic and drug use characteristics and were interviewed using the semistandardized Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that effective empathic communication in the context of patient care is associated with improved health care outcomes. However, the emphasis given to empathy in medical education in Iran is limited, and the state of such teaching is unknown in many countries. Aims: To determine the psychometric properties of an Iranian translation of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) among medical students, and to examine the differences on mean empathy scores by gender and the different years of medical school. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students. Data analysis was based on 181 questionnaires. Principal component analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation was used to identify the number and composition of components constituting the developed constructs. Results: The PCA yielded three factors: Compassionate care, perspective-taking, and the ability to walk in the patient's shoes. No statistically significant differences in the empathy means scores were found by gender and the different years of medical school. Conclusions: The Persian version of JSPE is a psychometrically sound instrument to measure empathy.

In line with Cultivation Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior, the results showed that adolescents' music video viewing is a significant marker of later risky driving behavior and that this relationship is mediated through their attitudes and intentions. No support was found for the hypothesis that music video viewing is part of a cluster of problem behaviors (Problem Behavior Theory).
