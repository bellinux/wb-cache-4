5|$|The {{official}} test {{session for}} Le Mans {{was held on}} 3 June, and was the only practice session that {{was not part of}} qualifying timing. A total of eight hours of <b>track</b> <b>time</b> was allowed for teams to find their set-ups and for rookie drivers to get in their required ten laps to learn the circuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton topped the {{timesheets}} once again, setting {{a time of}} 1:44.352, {{a quarter of a}} second clear of teammate Rosberg. Hülkenberg was third for Force India ahead of Ricciardo and Vettel. The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged the floor of his car when he ran over a drain cover on his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's <b>track</b> <b>time</b> was limited as well due to a loss of power; and a red flag period occurred right after the chequered flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, edging out Rosberg by almost seven-tenths of a second. Rosberg's running was limited as he coasted to a halt on track with twenty minutes of the session left to go due to losing drive. Ferrari was not {{competitive}} in eighth and thirteenth place for Vettel and Räikkönen respectively, with both cars suffering from problems with their energy recovery unit. The top five cars were powered by Mercedes, as Sergio Pérez led the charge behind Mercedes in third, ahead of Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg. Fernando Alonso managed eleventh place, but had to spend considerable time in the garage while his team worked on his car. Marcus Ericsson also had limited <b>track</b> <b>time</b> as a problem with his exhaust pipe forced him to miss {{the early part of}} the session. With loose kerbs detected during the GP2 qualifying session, drivers were instructed to stay clear of the kerbs at turn 6. Once more, many drivers had minor incidents on track, with some having to take to the run-off area at turn 3, while Gutiérrez touched the barrier at turn 8. Carlos Sainz Jr. spun at the first corner, but nevertheless finished the session in sixth, the fastest runner without a Mercedes power unit.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} in second practice on Friday afternoon {{with a time}} of 1:37.583, using the super-soft compound. Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent him back to the pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him <b>track</b> <b>time.</b> Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas. Slowest of the session was Sauber's Marcus Ericsson, with the two Manor drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein slotting in ahead of him. Wehrlein reported a loss of power after crossing the chequered flag {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E

500|$|The two Sauber {{drivers were}} eighth and ninth with Heidfeld {{in front of}} Räikkönen; Heidfeld was happy with his {{position}} after losing <b>track</b> <b>time</b> on Friday while Räikkönen complained {{that he had been}} blocked by Fisichella who was on an out lap. de la Rosa rounded out the top ten qualifiers and was happy after Jaguar engineer Humphrey Corbett corrected an issue with understeer on de la Rosa's car. Button took eleventh position and reported that his Benetton was well balanced. Frentzen took twelfth and said his qualifying position was more significant than his fourth-place finish in the Belgian Grand Prix. Irvine struggled with brake balance which shifted towards the rear of his Jaguar which meant he managed thirteenth. He also was unable to set a faster time after Olivier Panis blocked him by driving to the first corner apex and stopped his car. Fisichella used his Benetton team's spare car because his race car developed an hyradulic failure in practice but had an engine issue in the spare car which restricted him to fourteenth. BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Panis took the fifteenth and seventeenth positions and both reported that {{there was a lack of}} aerodynamic grip but mechanical grip was fine. The two were separated by Alesi in the slower of the two Jordan cars and described his session as [...] " [...] the worst qualifying session I could imagine on a circuit which love" [...] because he had brake balance and handling issues. Verstappen and Bernoldi took the eighteenth and nineteenth positions for the Arrows team. Enge set the twentieth fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session, and had two engine problems in both his race car and the spare monocoque tuned for Frentzen. The two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field with Fernando Alonso ahead of Yoong; both drivers stopped on their out laps with gearbox actuator failures and were required to share the spare Minardi car.|$|E
2500|$|Although many {{claim that}} the added <b>track</b> <b>time</b> gained by running a Xfinity or Truck Series race helps drivers during the Sprint Cup Series race, any {{profound}} advantages have yet to appear in final Cup Series championship standings. [...] In the last 15 years of his Sprint Cup career, Jeff Gordon {{did not participate in}} a single race in the lower series. [...] Jimmie Johnson only participated in six races since 2007, the last in 2013 at Phoenix. Meanwhile, Kyle Busch only won his first Cup Series title in 2015 − a year which was initially derailed due to an injury in Xfinity Series competition [...] − and failed to qualify for the Chase for the Sprint Cup during his 2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series championship run.|$|E
2500|$|A test day {{was held}} on 1 June, two weeks prior to the race, and allowed but did not require all {{entrants}} for the race to participate in eight hours of <b>track</b> <b>time</b> divided into two sessions. Krohn Racing {{did not attend the}} test due to lack of preparation, while Prospeed Competition's second car was also not entered. Millennium Racing had its race entry plus a second car entered for the test but did not arrive. AF Corse brought an additional Ferrari to allow more testing for drivers, bringing the total cars for the day to 54. Toyota set the pace of the day with a three minutes and 23.014 seconds lap set by Buemi in the second session, followed by Nakajima in the No. 7 Toyota in second. The No. 3 Audi of Marco Bonanomi was within a second of the top time, while the fastest Porsche was over a second and a half behind Buemi's lap. Roman Rusinov led the LMP2 class for G-Drive Racing with a three minutes and 37.795 seconds lap time ahead of Karun Chandhok's No. 48 Murphy Prototypes and Signatech Alpine. The LMGTE Pro category was led by Frédéric Makowiecki's Porsche with a three minutes and 57.260 seconds time, while the team's second car was damaged beyond repair early in the session after becoming airborne in the gravel traps of the Ford chicane. [...] Paolo Ruberti's 8 Star Motorsports Ferrari was the fastest in LMGTE Am, and the second fastest amongst all LMGTE runners, with a three minutes and 57.403 seconds lap. After the test several prototype teams, including all Audi, Porsche, and Toyota cars participated in an unofficial test on the shorter Bugatti Circuit the following day to ensure car components were working efficiently before the race.|$|E

2500|$|... "Cinema" [...] is an {{instrumental}} track recorded live at AIR Studios. Originally, the group developed an unreleased 20-minute song named [...] "Time" [...] {{and decided to}} include its two-minute opening on the final album. [...] "Leave It" [...] developed from a bass line from Squire and a melody from Rabin. When it came to recording the song, the band were {{not satisfied with the}} drum sound they were getting in the studio, so they recorded the vocals first. However, one of the engineers had removed the song's click <b>track</b> <b>time</b> references, causing various synchronisation problems. Rabin spent as much as three days re-doing the vocals onto a Synclavier, but it [...] "didn't feel completely right. So we redid the whole thing on top of the Synclavier stuff", a process that took several weeks. The lyrics to [...] "Our Song" [...] mentions the city of Toledo, Ohio, itself a reference to the band's show at the Toledo Sports Arena on their 1977 tour where the temperature on stage reached [...] The song received considerable radio airplay in the Toledo area. [...] "City of Love" [...] was inspired by Rabin's visit to Harlem in New York City while {{on his way to a}} rehearsal with Foreigner. His taxi arrived at the wrong address to a more dangerous part of the area. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Rabin started to write an [...] "ominous kind of thing" [...] which came easy to him following the experience, [...] "the idea of waiting for the night to come ... the derelicts came out of the sewers at nighttime to be thugs. Later Jon put his slant on it which made it more interesting". [...] "Hearts" [...] is the album's only track credited to the whole group. Rabin came up with the chorus and bridge a few months prior to meeting Squire and White for the first time. Kaye wrote its keyboard introduction, Rabin developed a melody from it, and Anderson developed its counter-melody.|$|E
