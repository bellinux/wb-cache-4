5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York <b>Times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was taken out of the lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E
5|$|After his career, Washington {{has complained}} of {{treatment}} {{he has received}} in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself {{as a victim of}} the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told The New York <b>Times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles <b>Times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not take the}} Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E

5|$|Chappell's battles {{against the}} short-pitched bowling of Snow {{during the season}} {{compelled}} him to reappraise his game. Following a conversation with Sir Donald Bradman, he decided to reinstate the hook shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg. Although he still regularly lost his wicket after playing the shot, Chappell felt that the psychological benefit of showing aggression to opposing bowlers offset the <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was dismissed for a low score.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down {{the sequence of events}} that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is the rightful king by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|In January 1978, Kerry {{arrived at}} Indiana University, {{studying}} theatre, drama and telecommunications. Based on the <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> recorded for Indiana, Kerry was {{named in the}} Australian squad for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada. However, his international career {{appeared to be in}} disarray when along with two teammates, Tonelli and Joe Dixon, he was expelled from the Australian team for breaking a curfew on American Independence Day during a training camp in Honolulu, Hawaii. According to Tonelli, Kerry was late because he was courting a female he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking. Tonelli also admitted to the officials that he had smoked marijuananot illegal under Hawaii lawon the night. In the aftermath of the incident, Tonelli appeared on Australian television, strongly denying rumours that he had been involved in a drug-fuelled orgy with teammates. He admitted to smoking marijuana, but defended his actions, saying that it was not illegal. Supporters in Australia, including future Prime Minister Bob Hawke, launched a petition for the reinstatement of the trio, which garnered thousands of signatures, but to no avail.|$|E

5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he hoped she would be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The <b>Times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|White never {{remarried}} {{following his}} wife's death in 1915. In addition to White's church activities, {{he served as}} a master of the Masonic Lodge, and was affiliated with the Odd Fellows. Beginning in 1934, White endured 18 months of illness, and on August 14, 1935, his physician Dr. R. W. Dailey reported to the Cumberland Evening <b>Times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in critical condition and was unlikely to recover. White succumbed to his illness and died at his residence in Romney on August 15, 1935 at the age of 59 as a result of arteriosclerosis. Myocarditis also contributed to his prolonged illness but was not the cause of his death. White was interred with Masonic rites on Saturday afternoon, August 17, 1935 at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. A number of state officials attended his funeral.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 72 in {{the opening}} match {{of the season and}} adding 41 against the touring Englishmen for New South Wales, Booth {{retained}} his place in the Test team for the 196263 Ashes series. He scored his maiden Test century in the First Test at the Gabba, compiling 112 in the first innings of a high scoring draw. Thirteen innings reached fifty, but Booth was the only player to reach three figures. English captain Ted Dexter attempted to shut down Booth's scoring by employing leg theory. In the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Fred Titmus bowled outside leg stump with five men on the on side, but Booth completed consecutive centuries with 103 in the second innings. As a result of Dexter's defensive field placings, Booth scored at only half the rate he managed in the First Test. Booth took six hours to reach triple figures and hit only four boundaries. His innings was not enough to prevent England from completing a seven-wicket victory. Booth was unable to maintain his form {{for the rest of the}} season, with 34 and 77 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide being the only other <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> passed 20. Australia won the Third Test, drawing the series, and Booth ended the series with 404 runs at 50.50. He added a further three fifties in the Sheffield Shield as Victoria ended New South Wales' nine-year winning streak.|$|E
