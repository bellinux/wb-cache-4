5|$|In 2003, the Catalan {{parliament}} {{passed a}} resolution urging development of a government plan to improve the site. A government report in 2001, re-published in 2004, included a proposal to cut down the fragile Pi Vell, leaving <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> in place along with a commemorative monument, and purchase and develop the site as a public amenity.|$|E
5|$|In Atlanta, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Daryl (Norman Reedus), Glenn (Steven Yeun) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) have {{discovered}} the severed hand of Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), Daryl's brother, where Rick had handcuffed him {{on the roof of}} a store. They follow a trail of blood to show Merle had killed some walkers and managed to cauterize <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of his hand before the trail goes cold.|$|E
5|$|In his 1958 reelection campaign, McGovern faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from South Dakota's two-term Republican Governor and World War II Medal of Honor recipient Joe Foss, who was initially considered the favorite to win. But McGovern ran an effective campaign that showcased his political strengths of having firm beliefs {{and the ability}} to articulate them in debates and on <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> He prevailed with a slightly larger margin than two years before.|$|E
25|$|If a bowler's {{delivery}} hits <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> and if {{at least}} one bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> <b>the</b> striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in <b>the</b> <b>stump's</b> spigots). <b>The</b> ball can either have struck <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not bowled out if the ball is touched by a fielder or touched by the wicket-keeper or the umpire before hitting <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b> <b>The</b> batsman is not out if the bails remain on <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b>|$|R
25|$|A batter is out bowled even if he/she {{could be}} given out by another method of {{dismissal}} instead. For instance, suppose a ball that pitches in line with <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> hits <b>the</b> player on the pads in line with <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> and would, {{if it had not}} hit the pads, have struck <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b> <b>The</b> player could be out leg before wicket. However, if the ball ricochets off the pads onto <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> <b>the</b> batter would be given out bowled instead.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> keeper can <b>stump</b> <b>the</b> batsman {{by using}} the ball to remove the bails from <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> if <b>the</b> batsman is out of his crease after a {{delivery}} has passed <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> into keeper's hands. The keeper must then dislodge the bail(s) and the batsman is out, if he is still outside the crease.|$|R
5|$|Sycamores {{make new}} growth from <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> or roots if cut down and can {{therefore}} be coppiced to produce poles {{and other types of}} small timber. Its coppice stools grow comparatively rapidly, reaching up to 10feet in diameter in 450 years. It is grown as a species for medium to large bonsai in many areas of Europe where some fine specimens can be found.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{played a}} key role in 1856 in {{bringing}} forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because of his success as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, and his name was put in nomination by supporters (knowing that he supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore. Banks was active on <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> in support of Frémont, who lost the election to James Buchanan; Banks easily won reelection to his own seat. Democrats, however, regained control of the House of Representatives, depriving him of the speakership.|$|E
5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>stumps</b> {{are three}} {{vertical}} posts which support two bails. <b>The</b> <b>stumps</b> and bails are usually made of wood, most commonly ash, and together form a wicket {{at each end}} of the pitch.|$|R

5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when chariot racing began, but It {{may have been}} as old as chariots themselves. It is known from artistic {{evidence}} on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world, but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described by Homer, at the funeral games of Patroclus. The participants in this race were Diomedes, Eumelus, Antilochus, Menelaus, and Meriones. The race, which was one lap around <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a tree, was won by Diomedes, who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize. A chariot race also {{was said to be}} the event that founded the Olympic Games; according to one legend, mentioned by Pindar, King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race, but was defeated by Pelops, who founded the Games in honour of his victory.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> base.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{intensified}} to EF4 {{strength as}} it entered Van Buren County and tore {{through the south}} edge of Clinton, killing three people in the vicinity. One of these deaths occurred at a boat manufacturing plant in town which was destroyed. The plant was completely leveled to the ground, with its metal beam frame severely mangled. Homes in this area were leveled and swept from their foundations, vehicles were wrapped around trees and rendered nearly unrecognizable, a dentists office was obliterated, and trees were debarked. A church and several businesses were damaged as well. 62 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 30 were severely damaged, and 31 sustained minor damage. The tornado maintained EF4 intensity as it continued into Stone County, slamming into the town of Mountain View. The local hospital sustained heavy roof and wall damage, and several doctors offices were destroyed, along with a paint shop, a body shop, and a car parts store. A car dealership was completely flattened, with vehicles being tossed from the sales lot and across the highway. One vehicle was lofted a considerable distance {{through the air and}} over a building before being dropped into a ravine. Surveyors observed a utility pole in this area that was pulled up and jammed back into the ground with wires still attached. The town's fire station was heavily damaged, and one fatality occurred when a house was swept from its foundation. 38 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 15 sustained major damage, and 15 sustained minor damage in the Mountain View area. The tornado weakened slightly to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed into Izard County and impacted the rural community of Zion, killing two people, destroying 43 homes and mobile homes, severely damaging 14, and lightly damaging 36 more. Hundreds of cattle were killed in this area, and a Jeep was stripped down to its frame and tires and found wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a large tree that was snapped. An unanchored home in the area was swept clean from its foundation as well, leaving only the slab behind. Maintaining EF3 intensity, the tornado then struck the town of Highland in Sharp County, resulting in severe damage. At least 40 businesses along U.S. Route 412 in Highland were damaged or destroyed, including a strip mall, a restaurant, a church, and a car dealership. The local fire station was destroyed along with much of the equipment inside, and multiple vehicles were overturned along the highway. 40 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 8 sustained major damage, and 19 sustained minor damage in the Highland area. Highland High School and two apartment buildings sustained minor damage as well. To the northeast of Highland, the tornado rapidly weakened and dissipated.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a {{distinction}} is made between forest clearing or tree clearing, whereby the trees, including <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> are cleared, and stump or root clearing where {{the trees are}} first felled and <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> removed subsequently.|$|R

25|$|LW6/8 skiers use two {{skis and}} one pole in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. The {{two types of}} skiing differ in that in para-Nordic a skier cannot use a {{prosthesis}} while use prostheses or orthoses are allowed in para-Alpine. FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are followed for this class. Socks and other materials are used to pad and protect <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of the arm {{as the use of}} a prosthesis is not allowed.
