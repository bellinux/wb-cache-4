25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. <b>T-nuts</b> (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to <b>T-nuts</b> but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E

Unlike the {{standard}} round base <b>T-nuts,</b> the eight-sided <b>T-nuts</b> can be fed efficiently and reliably via machine. The eight-sided T-nut base {{has become the}} standard configuration for <b>T-nuts</b> inserted by machine.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>T-nut,</b> T nut, or tee nut (also {{known as}} a blind nut, which can however also refer to a rivet nut or an insert nut) {{is a type of}} nut used to fasten a wood, {{particle}} or composite materials workpiece, leaving a flush surface.|$|R
50|$|Each hole {{contains}} a specially formed <b>t-nut</b> to allow modular climbing holds to be screwed onto the wall. With manufactured steel or aluminum walls, an engineered industrial fastener {{is used to}} secure climbing holds. The face of the multiplex board climbing surface is covered with textured products including concrete and paint or polyurethane loaded with sand. In addition to the textured surface and hand holds, the wall may contain surface structures such as indentions (incuts) and protrusions (bulges), or {{take the form of}} an overhang, underhang or crack.|$|R

40|$|Vehicle is an {{important}} machine in human daily life. Nowadays, each family {{has at least one}} car to make the transportation easy and faster. For a car, the tool set-up for each vehicle is a <b>T-nut</b> wrench and car jacker which is hard to use for a women or teen to open their car’s nut. In 2006, a tire nut removal with 114 pitch circle diameter has been developed to replace <b>T-nut</b> wrench that can reduce the force and torque needed to open the nuts and open all four nuts simultaneously. This tool used mild steel as the main material to fabricate a gearing system and the gear ratio is 21. 125 gear ratio force reduction. The total weight of the product was 5. 5 kg. For this final year project, this tire nut removal has been improved about the weight, cost of production and the gear ratio. The new tire nut removal has 162 gear ratio that convert the force and torque better than the first tire but removal with 2. 5 kg total weight. The main material to fabricate the spur gear has been changed to thermoset plastic material that is Nylatron GSM Blue with lighter weight and cheaper compared to the mild steel material. The new gear ratio has convert the torque to 3. 45 Nm that can be supported by power window motor that will be used to help the 114 pitch circle diameter car user. The design of this product is demanded to be smaller and compact to make it easy and comfortable for the user. A new tire nut removal with 203 x 203 x 87. 5 mm has been designed to make the tire nut removal smaller, lighter and efficient...|$|R

5000|$|It has a long, thin {{body and}} a flange at one end, {{resembling}} a T in profile. The flanges of <b>T-nuts</b> often have hooks or serrations on the prongs that dig into a wooden work piece as the bolt is tightened from {{the opposite side of}} the piece, providing better retention.|$|E
50|$|A lathe {{faceplate}} {{is a basic}} workholding accessory for a wood {{or metal}} turning lathe. It is a circular metal (usually cast iron) plate which fixes {{to the end of}} the lathe spindle. The workpiece is then clamped to the faceplate, typically using <b>t-nuts</b> in slots in the faceplate, or less commonly threaded holes in the faceplate itself.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{face masks}} {{fall into two}} broad categories, the 'traditional', secured by screws and plastic loops or thin wire ties and a {{combination}} of screws and <b>T-nuts,</b> and the 'innovative' using some additional type of proprietary 'quick release' hardware. However, it should be recognized that helmet and face mask design {{is an area of}} active development and change.|$|E
50|$|MDF may be glued, doweled or laminated. Typical {{fasteners}} are <b>T-nuts</b> and pan-head machine screws. Smooth-shank nails do {{not hold}} well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge. Special screws are available with a coarse thread pitch, but sheet-metal screws also work well. Like natural wood, MDF may split when woodscrews are installed without pilot holes.|$|E
50|$|The machine uses {{linear guides}} in the X, Y, and Z axis {{including}} the gantry and custom flat connecting plates {{that can be}} fabricated {{with a number of}} tools including water jet cutter, plasma cutter, laser cutter, CNC mill or manually with a hacksaw and drill press. The FarmBot Genesis uses a belt and pulley system including NEMA 17 stepper motors with rotary encoders, GT2 belts and OpenBuilds v slot extrusions and wheels. Stainless steel screws, <b>t-nuts,</b> washers, bearings, driveshaft and leadscrew make the machine weather and corrosion-resistant allowing long term operation in outdoor environments.|$|E
50|$|A {{climbing}} hold is a shaped grip that {{is usually}} attached to a climbing wall so climbers can grab or step on it. On most walls, climbing holds are arranged in paths, called routes, by specially trained route setters. Climbing holds come in a large array of sizes and shapes to provide different levels of challenge to a climber. Climbing holds are either bolted to a wall via hex-head bolts and existing <b>t-nuts</b> or they are screwed on with several small screws. In extreme cases, concrete anchors may be used (if putting holds {{on the underside of}} a bridge, for example).|$|E
50|$|Brooklyn Boulders {{was founded}} in 2009 by Lance Pinn, Jeremy Balboni, and Stephen Spaeth, who {{wanted to create a}} {{dedicated}} rock climbing facility when there previously was none. Prior to opening, a Facebook group called “NYC Needs a Climbing Gym” was formed and over three hundred members joined overnight. By July 2009, the group reached over 1,000 members. Construction began in March 2009, and Brooklyn Boulders hosted “t-nut parties” on weekends, where anyone was permitted to visit, lend a hand setting <b>t-nuts</b> into the walls in exchange for free day passes. Brooklyn Boulders is also home to the Adaptive Climbing Group, founded by amputee climber Kareemah Batts.|$|E
50|$|Volumes are an {{extremely}} large type of hold that any variety of holds can be attached to. The volume {{is attached to}} the wall, and it has pre-placed <b>t-nuts</b> in it to which other holds can be attached. Volumes were at one time made from wood, but now they are also made in a variety of materials (including fiberglass, coated wood, resin, urethane, and moulded plastic) by several climbing companies. Volumes are especially prevalent in Europe and on the World Cup circuit, where sometimes entire routes will be constructed from gigantic volumes. To imitate these textured World Cup volumes, sandpaper can be placed on homemade wooden volumes to create texture and allow climbers {{to make use of the}} volume's features.|$|E
5000|$|Pressurized {{walls are}} {{temporary}} walls built with reams of [...] " [...] (6 mm) to [...] " [...] (16 mm) sheet rock (plasterboard), metal 2 × 3s (approx. 5 × 7 cm) or 2 × 4s, or taped, plastered and compounded. Most installation companies utilize LATTICE strips of wood {{to cover the}} joints of the above drywall. After the frame-out process, 1" [...] (32 mm) sheet rock screws are used to attach the drywall to the pressurized 2×4s that contact the floor, the ceiling and {{the sides of the}} property's walls. In order to prevent structural or architectural damage, only <b>T-nuts</b> and leveling screw pads are used on those studs. No additional fasteners or adhesives are used to add stability to the frame work.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} work {{details the}} design and fabrication of a tabletop thermoform machine {{with the goal of}} making this machine cheaper than the ones on the market, yet able to fulfill specific requirements. These functional requirements include creating parts that have dimensions within. 05 " of the original part; thermoforming plastics that range between a 3 " x 3 " and 12 " x 12 " size; and having the ability to heat the plastic to at least 150 °C in order to thermoform plastics such as polycarbonate. In addition, this machine had to be simple to manufacture and use. In order to achieve these requirements, a top to bottom drape forming architecture with a four bar linear slider and carriage, was constructed. In order to constrain the plastics of different sizes, two similar, modular wooden plates were used such that the plastic was held in between them via <b>t-nuts</b> and screws. When the user clamps the plastic onto the carriage, he or she slides the carriage upwards to an oven that radiates heat via nichrome wire on a mica sheet. Once the desired temperature is reached, the user then slides the carriage down onto a vacuum box platform, where a mold is present, and forms the plastic over the mold. While that happens, a negative pressure is applied inside the box via a standard commercial vacuum, so that the plastic adheres more closely to the mold. For the testing process, this work focuses on two manufacturing strategies for thermoforming parts: heating the air to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming, and heating the plastic to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming. Once this test was performed, the dimension of each plastic part was examined in order to see if the tolerance levels were reached. In addition, this test determined {{whether or not there was}} a statistical significance between the qualities of parts made by either of these processes. In the end, the thermoform machine was only able to reach an average tolerance of. 07 " for the created parts. In addition, there was no statistical significance between the part qualities of either one of the tested manufacturing processes. Some of the main reasons behind this include having an ineffective vacuum box and clamp design issues, which will be focused on in the future iteration of this project. by Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw.
