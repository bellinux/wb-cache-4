5|$|According to the {{procedure}} {{described in the}} 1975 Aron patent, and <b>the</b> <b>Pharmaceutical</b> Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.|$|E
5|$|Another oral drug, cladribine, was {{approved}} in Russia and Australia in 2010.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> {{division}} was sold for €4.6 billion.

50|$|On December 19, 2006 the {{majority}} of shareholders voted to approve the sale of <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> division to <b>the</b> Danish company Nycomed. Nycomed is owned by an investment consortium led by Nordic Capital and Credit Suisse. With the sale of <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> division, headquartered in Konstanz, Germany, Altana lost a major pillar of its business. At that time, 9,000 of the company’s 13,500 employees were working for Altana in <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> sector, generating two-thirds of the company’s total revenue. And indeed, the balance-sheet revenues fell by around 60 percent in 2006, but gained over six percent in 2007.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the post-communist period, <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> {{industry}} has mainly been {{an obstacle to}} reform.

5|$|When a {{compound}} has limited {{solubility in water}} it is common practice (in <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry, for example) to determine pKa values in a solvent mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble. In the example shown at the right, the pKa value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{thallium}} {{is produced}} not from potassium ores, {{but as a}} byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores.

The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{has been}} carried out {{as a part of the}} project Utilization of long term (passive) {{sampling}} methods combined with in situ microcosms for assessment of (bio) degradation potential (PASSES). In the frame of the project groundwater remediation took place in the premises of Farmak a. s. in Olomouc using a pilot photooxidation unit and efficiency of the remediation was monitored through passive and active sampling methods. Pilot photooxidation unit is a technology based on the H 2 O 2 /UV-C photochemical oxidation of organic pollutants. In this work optimization tests of the pilot photooxidation unit were performed. The residence time of the groundwater in the photoreactors, required for its sufficient decontamination from pharmaceuticals and aromatic hydrocarbons, was 2. 5 hours. 91 % degradation of <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and 80 % degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons were reached during this interval. Although the removal efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> by <b>the</b> photooxidation unit was high, the pilot photooxidation unit was not able to effectively remove <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> at <b>the</b> studied locality.

5|$|In {{material}} sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic {{systems have}} been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry, due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity; recrystallization is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|E
