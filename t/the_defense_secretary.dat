25|$|In 2012, Obama, who had {{previously}} demanded the resignation of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad, said {{that the use of}} chemical weapons by the Assad government would be crossing a red line and would entail U.S. military action. After reports on 21 August 2013 about the usage of chemical weapons in Syria, the Obama administration formally blamed the incident on the Syrian government and sought Congressional approval for military action in Syria. Besides, Obama sought support from Britain and France for an attack in Syria. <b>The</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Secretary</b> Chuck Hagel approved plans for a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missile strikes to have those called off by Obama in September. On 11 September 2013, Obama put a military strike or combat operations on hold and achieved an agreement with Russia and the Syrian government to destroy all chemical weapons in Syria.|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{supported}} Thi's removal as {{they regarded}} {{him as being}} soft on communism, and a [...] "virtual warlord". US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., Westmoreland and <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Secretary</b> Robert McNamara were supportive of the Kỳ-Thiệu regime, their prosecution of {{the war against the}} communists and support of a US escalation, and they opposed Thi, regarding him as lacking firmness against communism. At a White House meeting after news of the dismissal came through, Taylor said that Thi was [...] "a bad character and good riddance". Lodge wrote in a report that Thi [...] "cherished some resentment against the Americans in respect of what he considers political and military interference and infringement of sovereignty", claiming he had contemplated [...] "the possibility of establishing a government in the south which would be of such a character that the bulk of the population including the Vietcong would support it—and presumably neutralization of the country and possibly federation with the North would soon be possible". The Americans wanted to ease Thi out of the corridors of power by offering him an economic future in the US and free education for his children, and Lodge and Westmoreland personally spoke to him in an attempt to convince him to accept, but they were unsuccessful. On the other hand, Thi had the support of Walt, who commanded American forces in I Corps and was the senior advisor to Thi's forces. Unlike his countrymen, Walt thought highly of Thi, and his ability as an officer.|$|E
