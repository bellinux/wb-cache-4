5|$|In 1973, Congress {{repealed}} <b>termination</b> {{and restored}} federal {{recognition of the}} Menominee tribe. The Menominee Restoration Act was signed by Richard Nixon; it repealed the Menominee Indian <b>Termination</b> Act, reopened the tribal rolls, re-established the trust status and provided for the reformation of tribal government. The tribe was the first terminated tribe to be restored to trust and recognition status. The Restoration Act signaled {{the end of the}} <b>termination</b> era.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for <b>termination,</b> {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that <b>termination</b> would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the tribe with the Menominee Indian <b>Termination</b> Act. According to the terms of the <b>Termination</b> Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of <b>termination</b> until 1961. The tribe was opposed to <b>termination</b> for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E

5|$|On <b>termination,</b> the Menominee, {{which was}} one of the wealthiest tribes prior to <b>termination,</b> became one of the poorest. In 1954, the tribe's timber {{operations}} allowed it to be self-sufficient. The tribe, which owned utility companies, paid for a hospital, BIA salaries, local schools, and a stipend to tribal members. The tribe was forced to use its reserve funds to develop a <b>termination</b> plan that they did not want and instead of having a reserve, they entered into <b>termination</b> with a $300,000 deficit. Menominee County was created out of the old reservation boundaries and the tribe immediately had to finance its own police and fire protection. Without federal support and with no tax base, the situation became dire. The tribe closed the hospital, sold its utility company, and contracted those services to neighboring counties. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., formed to care for the tribe's needs after <b>termination,</b> was unable to pay property taxes and began to consider selling off tribal property. Many Menominee tribal members believed that the sponsor of the <b>termination</b> bill, Senator Arthur Wilkins of Utah, intended to force the loss of rich tribal lands to non-Indians. In 1962, the state of Wisconsin took the position that the hunting and fishing rights were abrogated by the <b>termination</b> act and that the tribal members were subject to state hunting and fishing regulations. With the poverty in the former reservation, the loss of hunting rights meant the loss of one of their last remaining means of survival.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, many {{studies have focused on}} the muscles and dense {{connective}} tissues located in the suboccipital region. Our study investigated the existence of the second <b>terminations</b> originating from the suboccipital muscles, and the relationship between the variable types of the To Be Named Ligament (TBNL). Anatomical dissection was performed on 35 head-neck specimens. The existence of the second <b>terminations</b> of the suboccipital muscles was confirmed and various types of the TBNL were observed in this study. The second <b>terminations</b> originated from multiple suboccipital muscles including the rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPmi), rectus capitis posterior major (RCPma) and obliquus capitis inferior (OCI) muscles, merged and terminated at the TBNL. The overall incidence of the second <b>terminations</b> of the suboccipital muscles was 34. 29 % and it varied among the various suboccipital muscle origins. 28. 57 % of the second <b>terminations</b> originated from the RCPma; 11. 43 % was from the RCPmi and 8. 57 % was from the OCI. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the existence of second <b>terminations</b> and the particular type of the TBNL. 95 % of the arcuate type of the TBNL was accompanied with the second <b>terminations</b> which attached to their turning part, whereas only 10 % of all the radiate type of the TBNL was accompanied with the second <b>terminations.</b> This study for the first time described the second <b>terminations</b> originating from multiple suboccipital muscles and demonstrated the relationship with the various types of the TBNL. We speculated that the second <b>terminations</b> maintain the arcuate TBNL and transfer tensile forces to the Myodural Bridge (MDB), thereby modulating the physiological functions of the MDB...|$|R
40|$|The surface <b>terminations</b> of 122 -type {{alkaline}} earth metal iron pnictides AEFe 2 As 2 (AE = Ca, Ba) are investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). Cleaving these crystals at a cryogenic temperature yields {{a large majority}} of <b>terminations</b> with atomically resolved square-root-two (rt 2) or 1 * 2 lattice, as well as the very rare <b>terminations</b> with 1 * 1 symmetry. By means of lattice alignment and chemical marking, we identify these <b>terminations</b> as rt 2 -AE, 1 * 2 -As, and rt 2 -Fe surfaces, respectively. Layer-resolved spectroscopy on these terminating surfaces reveals a well-defined superconducting gap on the As <b>terminations,</b> while the gap features become weaker and absent on AE and Fe <b>terminations</b> respectively. The local gap features are hardly affected by the surface reconstruction on As or AE surface, whereas a suppression of them along with the in-gap states can be induced by As vacancies. The emergence of two impurity resonance peaks at +- 2 meV is consistent with the sign-reversal pairing symmetry. The definite identification of surface <b>terminations</b> and their spectroscopic signatures shall provide a more comprehensive understanding of the high-temperature superconductivity in multilayered iron pnictides...|$|R

5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} <b>termination</b> of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous <b>termination</b> (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

40|$|The {{multi-port}} {{method for}} {{the measurement of}} the scattering parameters of multi-ports {{with the help of}} a vector network analyzer (VNA) with only two measurement ports is presented. For the measurements only two ports of the N-port device can be connected to the two ports of the VNA at a time. The remaining N - 2 ports of the device under test (DUT) are connected to external <b>terminations.</b> As these external <b>terminations</b> might be mismatched, the measured scattering parameters depend on the reflective characteristics of the <b>terminations.</b> An error correction becomes necessary in order to calculate the effective scattering parameters of the DUT (Tippet and Speciale, 1982; Lu and Chu, 2003). In contrast to the correction method of Tippet and Speciale (1982), the multi-port method has the advantage, that the external <b>terminations</b> can be chosen arbitrarily. Thus, a realization as an open or short circuit is possible as well. Furthermore, the <b>terminations</b> can be unknown except for one, similar to self-calibration procedures of VNAs. This helps to improve the accuracy of the measurements, because the inconsistency problem due to a slightly erroneous knowledge of the frequency characteristics of the <b>terminations</b> can be eliminated...|$|R
