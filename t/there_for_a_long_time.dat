5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

25|$|The entire Early Dynastic {{period is}} {{generally}} dated to 2900–2350 BC {{according to the}} Middle Chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the Short Chronology. The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia {{by the middle of}} the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It is hard to tell where the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> The Sumerian language is identifiable from its initially logographic script which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Jews in Kuwait is {{connected}} to the {{history of the}} Jews in Iraq. In 1776 Sadeq Khan captured Basra, many of the inhabitants left the country and among them were Jews who went to Kuwait. With the Jews' efforts, the country flourished with its buildings and trades. Around 1860, their number increased and their trade flourished. They were mostly wholesalers and worked with India—Baghdad and Aleppo. They even exported to Europe and China. There were about 80 Jewish families in Kuwait living in one district where the Bank of Trade. They had their own Synagogue with their Sefer Torah. In the Synagogue, they had separate place for the women. Saturday is a sacred day. Jews didn't work that day. They also had their own Cemetery which shows that they lived <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Kuwait's population is now thirty five thousand {{and most of them are}} Arabs. Before 1914 there were about 200 Jews. Most of them went back to Baghdad and few went to India. There were two wealthy Jews in Kuwait but the rest were middle class, being Jewellers or material traders.|$|E
25|$|Problems also arose between Diogo and the Portuguese {{settlers}} at Sao Tome {{known as}} Tomistas. According to a treaty between Kongo and Portugal, the former were only to trade within the latter's realm for slaves. That meant the Portuguese were {{restricted to the}} slaves offered by King Diogo or those he authorized to sell slaves. Every year the Tomistas would come with 12 to 15 ships to carry back between 400 and 700 slaves (5,000–10,000 slaves a year). This {{was not enough to}} take advantage of Kongo's ever-growing supply of slaves thanks to wars on its eastern frontier. The captains would try to overload their cargos, resulting in revolts. However, the factor that actually broke the deal was the Tomista habit of sailing upriver to the Malebo Pool to purchase slaves from BaTeke traders who were increasingly taken with European goods over the nzimbu shells the manikongo offered them. Enraged by this breach of contract, King Diogo broke off relations in 1555 and expelled 70 or so Portuguese living in his realm (many of whom had lived <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> with African wives and mixed-race children).|$|E

2500|$|According {{to normal}} English usage (e.g. [...] "French-speaking Canadians"), [...] "Swedish-speaking Finns" [...] means [...] "Finnish {{citizens}} that speak Swedish as their mother tongue" [...] {{and does not}} include people who have learned it as a foreign language. According to normal English usage, this can be abbreviated to Swedish Finns and Swedish speakers, and these less cumbersome expressions are preferable even when addressing people in Nordic countries in English, as for example in this article, {{as long as the}} meaning has been explained. The reason an explanation of the normal meaning of the English expression Swedish Finns is necessary in Scandinavia is because this is often confusingly used in English translations in Sweden and Finland to refer to Finns that have moved to Sweden and to the Finnish ethnic minority that has lived <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> These people should instead be called [...] "Finnish immigrants" [...] and [...] "Finnish Swedes" [...] (or [...] "Finnish ethnic minority in Sweden") respectively according to modern, unambiguous English usage. The reason they are often still called [...] "Swedish Finns" [...] or [...] "Sweden Finns" [...] is the old usage that emphasised the ethnic origin of immigrants instead of their status as citizens of the new country, but this usage is confusing and diminishing, as explained above.|$|E
