50|$|In December 2016, Hanka {{released}} her third solo album recorded in duo with pianist Ondrej Krajňák, who also worked on her previous two CDs. The album is called <b>Twin</b> <b>Flame</b> and {{pays tribute to}} celebrated jazz pianists. Hanka decided to work with selected instrumental tunes written by well-known jazz pianists, vocalized them and wrote her own lyrics. (Oscar Peterson, Ernest Oláh - famous gipsy Slovak pianist, Chick Corea, McCoy Tyner, Thelonious Monk, Ondrej Krajňák and Mal Waldron). At the same time, this album represents the pinnacle of cooperation {{with one of the}} Europe best composers-pianists, Ondrej Krajňák originally from Slovakia. The album was named after his original composition <b>Twin</b> <b>Flames.</b> This name captures the essence of both artists whose music is something like karmic <b>twin</b> <b>flames,</b> representing one soul in two bodies, the exquisite balance between a female and male principle.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} part of the {{experimental}} investigation on the feasibility of inverse diffusion flame (IDF) for impingement heating. This part is aimed to identify the favorable IDF structure for impingement heating. Seven IDF structures have been observed altogether. Among them the favorable flame structure for impingement heating is identified to comprise a short base diffusion flame and a long premixed <b>flame</b> <b>torch,</b> separated by a contracted flame neck, which acts as a mixing zone for air and fuel and stabilizes the premixed <b>flame</b> <b>torch.</b> This unique <b>flame</b> structure allows the IDF to possess the advantages of both premixed and diffusion flames, with no flashback, high flame temperature and less or no soot emission. The emission measurement shows it emits low level of nitrogen oxides. Its favorable thermal structure and emission characteristics make it a desirable option for impingement heating.

5000|$|According {{to spiritual}} {{teachers}} like Mark L. Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, {{it is not}} a soulmate that is one’s true love, perfect match, or literal other half as is often times imagined, but instead it is the <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> that is one’s true love, perfect match or literal other half. In The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and <b>Twin</b> <b>Flames</b> the Prophet’s state that “A soulmate relationship {{has to do with the}} seat of the soul chakra, that chakra just above the base. The connection is one of parallel and mutual evolution rather than origin.”. With the chakra [...] "just above the base" [...] often being described as “the creativity and sexual chakra”, the Prophet’s claim that a true “literal other half” relationship doesn't center around energies or activities believed to be related to the sacral chakra is not completely inconsistent with the claims Plato makes about a literal other half relationship in his Symposium. In his Symposium, Plato has the character Aristophanes relate that “the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else.” In The Ascended Masters on Soulmates and <b>Twin</b> <b>Flames,</b> the Prophet’s state that “if you really meditate at inner levels, you know that that relationship doesn’t go as high or is not as profound as the one with the person who is your direct counterpart—the <b>twin</b> <b>flame</b> you have known as your other self from the first moment of your creation.” ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the layer by layer (LbL) {{technique}} has been adopted {{for the construction of}} hybrid organic-inorganic nanoarchitectures capable of adapting to extreme heat or flame exposure and chemically evolving into thermally-stable carbon based structures. More specifically, the LbL has been applied to an open cell poly(urethane) (PU) foam in order to increase its thermal and flame stability. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the LbL assembly covered each surface of the PU complex three-dimensional structure without altering its open cell morphology. When exposed to a direct flame, the treated PU foam was capable of stopping combustion within few seconds after ignition, unlike the untreated foam that burned completely. Under different irradiative heat fluxes (from 35 up to 75 kW/m 2), the coating demonstrated exceptional performances by reducing the rate of heat release up to 60 % with respect to the untreated counterpart. Finally, when subjected to a <b>flame</b> <b>torch</b> penetration (Tflame≈ 1300 °C), the LbL-coated PU foam was capable of maintaining its three-dimensional structure, thus successfully insulating the unexposed side (T below 100 °C after two <b>flame</b> <b>torch</b> applications) with temperature drops of 800 °C achieved with a specimen thickness of only 10 m...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} of n-decane polydisperse spray flames stabilized in a laminar two-dimensional counterflow configuration {{were conducted by}} the Eulerian/Lagrangian approach. For the gaseous phase, the Navier-Stokes equation together with mass, energy and species conservation equations was solved based on the finite control volume method with the SIMPLE algorithm. Transport properties and thermodynamic data of the gaseous species were obtained by CHEMKIN. For the disperse phase, all the individual droplets were tracked without using a concept of the droplet parcel. The film theory was employed for estimating a droplet evaporation rate and heat transferred from the gaseous phase to a droplet. As a result, {{it was found that}} <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> of premixed combustion of pre-vaporized fuel and diffusion combustion of droplet groups were observed on the spray flow side and that the combustion intensity of the <b>twin</b> <b>flames</b> are different significantly depending on the droplet size distributions. This is mainly caused by the fact that prevaporization of fuel prior to combustion varies markedly depending on the droplet size distribution...|$|R
