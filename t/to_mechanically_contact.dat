40|$|Apparatus {{and methods}} were {{developed}} <b>to</b> enable <b>mechanically</b> facilitated cell-cell electrofusion to be performed. The apparatus and methods mechanically place cells in contact before fusion. The {{key component of}} this fusion system was a newly developed fusion chamber. The chamber was composed of two functionally identical electrodes that were housed in a multi-layer structure. The layers functioned as support for the electrodes. They also allowed adjustment of the distance between opposing electrode faces. The electrodes were constructed {{in a manner that}} allowed cells to be deposited, by vacuum, onto each face. Electrode faces were positioned at a predetermined distance from each other <b>to</b> <b>mechanically</b> force cell-cell <b>contact</b> between the deposited cells. Fusion was induced by delivering direct current pulses to the juxtaposed cells. Fusion products were detected and quantitated by flow cytometry. Details of the chamber design and a protocol for using the fusion chamber are given. Mechanically facilitated cell-cell electrofusion was demonstrated by using the chamber to produce fusion products from like fusion partners. The practical applicability of the chamber was demonstrated by fusing unlike cell types. Mechanically facilitated cell-cell electrofusion is not specific to the cells used in this study; the chamber can be adapted for use with other cell types...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} major implications brought in the crossing resistance of <b>mechanically</b> <b>contacted</b> metals when operating in the high electronic injection regime, i. e., steady state interfacial voltage values greater than the max. acceptable level determined by specifications and less than the melting voltage. Under such operating conditions, monolayers of positive ions may be formed within interfacial cavities filled by the material from the surrounding space. The dominating ion neutralization process on the cathode controls the formation of “Helmholtz” inner layers at the metal cathode+oxide+gas interface. The presence of a positive ion monolayer over the cathode electrode will tend to reduce the field threshold required for electronic field emission and affect the overall currentvoltage characteristics...|$|R

40|$|In {{real world}} even the {{simplest}} of the electrical components may exhibit unpredictable characteristics, {{and it seems that}} the theory of chaos touches all disciplines. In this work, the contact potential instabilities induced by the high electronic injection rates between metal-to-metal contacts are experimentally investigated in an I-V phase space using state-of-the-art data logging systems. The <b>mechanically</b> <b>contacted</b> metals are energized by a sinusoidal power source, and their response is systematically studied within a 50 -Hz cycle. The obtained results convincingly demonstrate their chaotic nature. Two entirely different instability types have been observed for such systems.

40|$|Abstract—We {{have built}} a body of {{evidence}} which shows that, given a mathematical specification of a dense linear algebra operation to be implemented, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>mechanically</b> derive families of algorithms and subsequently <b>to</b> <b>mechanically</b> translate these algorithms into high-performing code. In this paper, we add to this evidence by showing that the algorithms can be statically analyzed and translated into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of coarse-grained operations {{that are to be}} performed. DAGs naturally express parallelism, which we illustrate by representing the DAGs with the G graphical programming language used by LabVIEW. The LabVIEW compiler and runtime execution system then exploit parallelism from the resulting code. Respectable speedup on a sixteen core architecture is reported. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} described in this thesis is to further {{our understanding of the}} motor control strategies that are available to the child when learning to produce meaningful interactions with environmental surfaces. The principal aim is to explore the analytical techniques {{that could be used to}} evaluate the range of neuromechanical responses for the lower limb that would provide stability at the limb/environment interface during growth and development. Five studies are presented that provide both experimental data and theoretical perspectives that were coalesced in the formulation of a general model for the control of stability at the limb/environment interface. The first study presents an analytical technique that was devised to classify the spatial-temporal organization of the surface myoelectric activity into one of three distinct patterns: Burst, Tonic, and Tonic Burst. This classification permits the matching between the pattern of muscle activity and the kinematic and kinetic control of the ground contact phase of landing. In the second, and companion paper, different distributions of the Burst, Tonic, and Tonic Burst patterns across the muscles of the lower limb were associated with three mechanical responses of the limb <b>to</b> ground <b>contact.</b> <b>Mechanically,</b> the three limb responses show a progression toward an effective control of stability at the limb/environment interface and it was therefore proposed that the distribution of activity patterns could reflect the priorities of system at different stages of growth and development. The results support our hypothesis that more complex movements can be executed when the limits of stability are maximized. Study three presents a formal model for the control of stability at the limb/environment interface. The model was further applied to propose new theoretical approaches that could be used in the clinical milieu, shifting the focus of the evaluation to the range of feasible movements that would be availabl...|$|R
