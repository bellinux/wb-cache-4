5|$|Dreamtime: Concerning the Boundary between Wilderness and Civilization is an anthropological and {{philosophical}} study of <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> {{states of consciousness}} found in shamanism and European witchcraft written by German anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr.

5|$|FH is {{classified}} as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E

5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the battle of the}} minds in the case of John’s Multiple Personality Disorder in the movie Peacock. Through the battle of the minds between John and his alter {{personality}} Emma, I want to find out the cause, the process, and the result of the battle. To analyze the battle of the minds, I am using the theory of Multiple Personality Disorder. In my analysis, I find out that the battle of the minds is caused by the existance of <b>the</b> <b>alter,</b> <b>the</b> resolutions of the host, and the interference of <b>the</b> <b>alter.</b> It takes place with the attack of <b>the</b> <b>alter</b> and <b>the</b> defense of the host, and the result of the battle is the victory of <b>the</b> <b>alter...</b>|$|R
50|$|The host {{is often}} the {{personality}} that seeks treatment. Therefore, the psychotherapists often deal primarily with the host personality. Part of the therapeutic process for DID involves helping the host recognize <b>the</b> <b>alters</b> and become aware when <b>the</b> <b>alters</b> are present. In some cases, the host is unaware of any alters or even that they have DID. in other cases, the host is aware of their condition, {{but they may not}} be aware of what <b>the</b> <b>alters</b> are or what they do while in those states. There are situations where the host wants therapy; however, one or more of <b>the</b> <b>alters</b> does not and can try to end the therapeutic process. While the host is aware of the person's body, <b>the</b> <b>alters</b> are not always aware that they share the same body as the host, which can lead to belief that suicide would have no effect on the host.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, Morton {{returned}} to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, Burn the Priest, through Legion Records. Mikey Brosnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania through DIY shows. The album was produced by Today Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Adler's younger brother Willie became the band's second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumour, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God after being banned from venues; these bans occurred afterwards. They changed their name because of <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> line-up, and to avoid being mistaken for a satanic metal band.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-{{flowering}} species, {{relying on}} post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage}} of favourable growing conditions in <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, {{it is one of the}} slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and wattles (Acacia). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>altered</b> {{bill was}} passed as an Act of Parliament in 1834. It was this act which founded the City of London School, which {{initially}} had around 400pupils. The act gave the Corporation of London {{a duty to}} maintain a school on the Honey Lane Market site and so gave control over {{almost every aspect of}} the school's running to the Corporation. A committee was also set up to manage the school, with Hale as chairman. Although the committee's powers were initially limited, they gained more control over time as they made important decisions for the school.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area {{than those of the}} Mk I.|$|E

5|$|When Mardonius' raids {{disrupted}} the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies {{to rethink their}} strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication. Despite this defensive move by the Greeks, {{it was in fact}} the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks. Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried to take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> strategic situation he thought he had produced. Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.|$|E
5|$|When Tintin in the Congo {{was first}} {{released}} by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. <b>The</b> <b>altered</b> page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.|$|E
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. <b>The</b> <b>altered</b> chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, Blizzard {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (approx. $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (approx. $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (approx. $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (approx. $56). The end-user license agreement (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard. Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving Blizzard greater control over how the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how <b>the</b> <b>altered</b> EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard.|$|E
