To illustrate {{the performances of}} such solution, we choose to apply this architecture to a 64 carriers 16 QAM modulated OFDM. We first introduce the problematic of the realisation of a highly linear transmitter. We then present the Envelope Elimination and Restoration solution and draw attention to its major weakness: a high sensitivity to desynchronization between the phase and envelope signal paths. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive synchronization algorithm relying on a feedback loop, a Least Mean Square formulation and involving an interpolation step. It enables the correction of delay mismatches and tracking of possible variations. We demonstrate {{that the quality of}} the interpolator has a direct impact on Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) value and output spectrum.

Indeed, most radio communication standards employ nonconstant envelope modulation {{such as in the}} 802. 11 series. Owing to power amplifiers ’ nonlinearities, distortions on the modulations degrade the overall <b>transmitter</b> <b>performance.</b> As a consequence, linearization methods, such as envelope elimination and restoration, have to be employed.

This prototype modem was fabricated by contractor Teledyne Benthos, Inc. and is identified as Model ATM- 90 X. It was developed for use in the Seastar underwater Local Area Network (LAN). The ATM- 90 X modem is required to be capable of transferring large amounts of digital data at a range up to 500 m using the 33 - 55 kHz acoustic frequency band. The modem's <b>transmitter</b> <b>performance</b> was evaluated in term of its transmit frequency response, vertical beam pattern, and maximum source level. Underwater acoustic measurements were conducted in an anechoic water tank and the data were analyzed using signal processing techniques including Hilbert transforms, autocorrelation, and cross correlation. The transmission characteristics of the intended underwater acoustic communication channel were modeled to determine the required modem operating performance in the best and worst case situations. The measured performance characteristics were evaluated {{in the context of the}} communication link margin (i. e., the excess signal-to-noise ratio) associated with the modeled channels. The results show that (1) the modem transmit frequency response does not have acceptable flatness across the entire 33 - 55 kHz band; (2) the beam pattern in the vertical plane has a good hemisphere pattern; (3) estimated maximum source level is 175 dB re 1 uPa-m at broadside of the modem. Based on the evaluated performance, the ATM- 90 X modem can provide a successful communication link with the highest data rate at the range of 500 m in the best-case situation (least noise). However, in the worst-case situation, the communication link will fail to reach performance objectives. Royal Thai Navy autho...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Polar {{architecture}} is a regarded {{solution for the}} design of efficient transmitters for radiocommunication systems. However, this {{architecture is}} sensitive to delay mismatches between the envelope and the phase paths. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by baseband digital signal processing. We present several adaptive algorithms based on the minimization of the mean square error between the ideal signal and the signal generated by the transmitter. Since the system gain and phase offset of the system are not precisely known, we also consider the problem of the identification of these quantities in the feedback loop. We propose solutions for the direct correction of the unknown delays, which also account for the gain variation and phase offset. A model of a polar architecture is tuned on Agilent Advanced Design System and used to evaluate the algorithms. Results assess both the need of a calibration procedure and the relevance of the proposed solutions.

At the ratio of power of locking signal to output power less than - 13 dB (in 2 -cascade scheme per magnetron, respectively) we demonstrated a phase modulation bandwidth of over 1. 0 MHz. The carrier frequency spectrum width about of 1 Hz at the level less than - 60 dBc did not demonstrate broadening at wide range of magnitude and frequency of the phase modulation of the injection-locking signal. The wideband dynamic control of output power of the transmitter model was first experimentally demonstrated using two magnetrons, combined in power and injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals.
