50|$|Multiproduct {{branding}} strategy {{is when a}} company uses one name across all their products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding {{is also known as}} corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are Microsoft, Samsung, Apple, and Sony as the company's brand name is identical to <b>their</b> <b>trade</b> <b>name.</b> Other examples of multiproduct {{branding strategy}} include Virgin and Church & Dwight. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church & Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the Arm & Hammer family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. Multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This Masters by Research {{thesis is}} an Industry Oriented Project, and the Researcher is a {{full-time}} employee in an Australian Polyurethane Company as a Senior Chemical Engineer. The thesis examines the application viability of the Methyl formate blown rigid foams. In this regard the real trial applications, e. g. pipe filling, rigid foam spray and moulding have been conducted, which are commonly adopted in making most of the end products. In this thesis the physical properties that are most crucial from application point of view have been focused like dimensional stability, Compressive Strength, close cell contents, thermal conductivity and buoyancy. Comparison of few of these properties is also done, where needed, between the rigid foams blown with Methyl formate Vs 141 b - otherwise only Methyl formate blown foam is focused. The effects of different parameters on thermal conductivity of the foam have also been examined {{which is the most}} important characteristic of the foam used for insulation purpose. All these application trials have been found quite satisfactory and also achieved satisfactory results in respect to all those required characteristics of the foam e. g. flowability in pipe filling trial, thermal conductivity in insulation spray trial, dimensional stability and close cell contents, compressive strength in Buoyancy loss test. It is obvious and proved that the lower thermal conductivity value of 141 b compared to that of Methyl formate and Carbon dioxide gives lower thermal conductivity values both in spray foams and the hand pour. But the Methyl formate blown foams also show quite reasonable values to make it a choice as insulation foam. The Methyl formate blown spray insulation foams are successfully being produced and sold in the market by FSI USA and Australian Urethane Systems in Australia. <b>Their</b> <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> for Methyl formate is ECOMATE. In buoyancy test the rigid PU foam with moulded density range 40 - 42 kg/m 3 gave close cell content greater than 95 % and compressive strength of the range 0. 230 MPa to 0. 330 MPa and dimensional stability well within the spec as required for floatation vessels. The % buoyancy loss of the foam immersed for 30 days in pure water was found - 3. 9551 % and in 5 % trisodium phosphate water solution was - 4. 2423 %. This promising buoyancy results make the Methyl formate blown rigid foam the good choice for floating vessels body cavity filling as well. In a nutshell Methyl formate blown rigid foams are the good choice of the time...|$|E
40|$|Kuwait {{is ranked}} {{as one of}} the top ten {{countries}} in the world in regard to the incidence of adult diabetes mellitus (DM). [1] Although there are health services in Kuwait for DM it is important to understand the beliefs that impact on the health-related behaviours of Kuwaiti diabetics. This will help identify the triggers that prompt people to seek medical advice for their condition, to understand how people take their medications, and how/where they obtain medical information. This research aimed to explore the beliefs of older DM patients’ about their condition and use of medicines in Kuwait. Ethical approval was obtained from Kuwaiti Ministry of Health Ethics Committee to conduct semi-structured inter-views with type two DM patients. A topic guide, developed from the objectives of the study was used to guide the inter-views. Participants were recruited from the primary healthcare diabetic clinics pharmacy by the researcher (MA). A sampling frame was employed in the recruitment process, whereby every ﬁfth patient who met the inclusion criteria was invited to participate in the study. The inclusion criteria were: type two DM for > 6 months, living in Kuwait, age 50 and over, and receiving oral hypoglycaemic medications (but not insulin). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Interviews were audio-recorded and conducted inArabic. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. [2]Interviews were conducted with 15 patients (7 males) and lasted between 20 and 40 minutes. Nine themes emerged rom the data: causes of diabetes, behaviour toward medication, attitude to control diabetes, views about medicine, views about doctors and pharmacists, medication reminders, sources of information and support, social gatherings for men or women and social behaviour related to social gatherings. This paper reports the strongest theme “behaviour towards medication. ” Within this theme participants described wanting only the best treatment which related to evaluating diabetic medications according to <b>their</b> <b>trade</b> <b>name,</b> preferences for medicines originating from western over middle-eastern countries and the original medicines packaging over hospital packaging: ‘honestly, if the Glucophage wasn’t made in Germany I wouldn’t consider to take it’. Participants’ narratives revealed that patients trust the doctor’s but not the pharmacist’s medicines advice. Patients also described hoarding and stock piling medicines after the Iraqi invasion, during which time there had been no access to medicines, as well as sharing DM medicine between husband and wife or amongst neighbours and friends. This is the ﬁrst qualitative study to explore the social and cultural beliefs of diabetic patients’ illness and medicine-taking behaviour in Kuwait. However, it is recognised that this is a small study which cannot be generalised to the wider population. Future work will include investigating whether these views are prevalent amongst a wider diabetic population. An understanding of how the illness and medication beliefs held by Kuwaiti DM patients inﬂuences their health behaviours will be helpful in identifying ways of shaping their behaviour through targeted interventions to promote a healthier lifestyle and improved DM management. 1.

40|$|Boron dipyrromethenes are {{strongly}} colored solids that form intensely colored solutions with bright fluorescence upon irradiation and are better known by <b>their</b> <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> BODIPY. Over {{the last two}} decades these dyes have become an important class of fluorophores on account of their many excellent characteristics, as is evident from the numerous applications being reported for these dyes. Particularly their rich functionalization chemistry is a major reason for their attractiveness, as it allows a practically unlimited structural modification and hence provides a method to fine tune their chemical and physical properties. However, the traditional derivatization strategies are rather inefficient and/or require the manipulation of unstable intermediates. More efficient strategies to functionalize BODIPY dyes are based on C–H functionalization, allowing the introduction of the desired group in one reaction step. In this work, several C–H functionalization reactions were discovered and developed. Two different approaches to achieve functionalization of the C–H bond were explored. The first is based on transition metal catalyzed reactions involving C–H activation, the second strategy is based on radical reactions. The first developed reaction is a palladium catalyzed C–H arylation between a boron dipyrrin and a bromoarene at high temperatures. This arylation reaction affords 3 -monoaryl and 3, 5 -diaryl dyes in moderate yields. A cross-dehydrogenative C–H arylation procedure between benzothiophene and BODIPY was also investigated, but could provide the desired product only in a low yield. A milder arylation protocol at room temperature was developed using a ferrocene catalyzed reduction of aryldiazonium salts {{in the presence of a}} boron dipyrromethene dye. This radical C–H arylation is a fast and high yielding reaction displaying a broad scope. By using this procedure both 3 -monoaryl and 3, 5 -diaryl dyes can be synthesized. A second radical transformation that was developed uses oxidation of organoboranes, such as potassium trifluoroborate salts and boronic acids, in the presence of a BODIPY dye and provides a broad range of 3 -monoalkylated fluorophores. By pushing the reaction at a higher temperature di-, tri- and tetraalkylated dyes can also be prepared. These novel protocols proved to be powerful synthetic tools for the preparation of a broad range of BODIPY derivatives. The utility of these reactions was demonstrated by synthesizing several sophisticated molecules, including asymmetrically substituted fluorophores, annulated chromophores and solid-emissive dyes.
