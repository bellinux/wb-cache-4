5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E

5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{passed a}} new {{counterfeiting}} statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States. In United States v. Turner (1833), interpreting the new act, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that the offense of counterfeiting was committed {{even if the}} signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers.

5|$|In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a final judgment had been entered.

5|$|The Marshall Court heard six {{original}} habeas {{cases of}} a criminal nature. All of the cases involved detention in the District of Columbia and prior proceedings in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Because the D.C. circuit court did not utilize the practice of riding circuit, certificates of division {{could not have been}} granted in these cases. In the first two cases, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that it had jurisdiction to issue the writ in pre-conviction situations. In the next two cases, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that it did not have jurisdiction to issue the writ in post-conviction cases.|$|E

5|$|In Faretta v. California (1975), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that a {{criminal}} defendant {{has the right}} to knowingly and voluntarily opt for pro se representation at trial.

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> {{that the}} federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that the state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E

5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v.

Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v.

5|$|The Lines International {{conditions}} were applied {{by a different}} High Court judge {{in the case of}} Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009). The plaintiff argued that the Urban Redevelopment Authority ("URA") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given her case genuine consideration. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> that the URA had considered the planning approval application, and had explained to the plaintiff the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but the plaintiff had declined to amend her redevelopment plans.
