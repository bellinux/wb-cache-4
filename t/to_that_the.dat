5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of direct incentives, many firms applied {{to move to the}} Manor Royal estate: it was {{considered}} such an attractive place to relocate <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken. One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000. By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1969 as the Pilots in Seattle, Washington, {{the team}} moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the {{following}} season, which brought top-flight baseball back to Wisconsin {{for the first}} time since the Braves departed after the 1965 season. The Brewers have been members of the National League since 1998; prior <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> team played as a member of the American League Central Division. As such, they are the only team to appear in the Major League Baseball postseason representing both major leagues. Buck Rodgers and Harvey Kuenn led the team to one American League playoff appearance each, and Dale Sveum led the team to the 2008 National League wild card after replacing the fired Ned Yost with 12 games remaining in the season. Kuenn leads the franchise in playoff wins (6) and is the only manager inducted into the Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame, while Garner is the franchise's all-time managerial wins leader (563). The team's current manager is Craig Counsell, a former infielder who played part of his career with the Brewers, and who was hired after Ron Roenicke was fired on May 3, 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 16th century, King FrederickII of Denmark–Norway demanded that the Tsardom of Russia cede the peninsula.

5|$|Incubation lasts {{thirteen}} days, {{although the}} last egg laid may take 24hours {{longer than the}} first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, {{and is the only}} parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' faecal sacs are removed by the adults.|$|E

Equivalence test refers to the research design of which the objective is <b>to</b> verify <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experimental drug and the control drug have clinically equivalent efficacy. Superiority test refers to the research design of which the objective is <b>to</b> verify <b>that</b> <b>the</b> efficacy of the experimental drug is clinically superior <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> control drug.

5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E
