5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> {{magnetic}} poles are usually {{located near the}} geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geo{{magnetic poles}} leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E
