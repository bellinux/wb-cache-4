40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} architecture of a surfactant, particularly the attachment position of <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonate</b> on the hexadecane backbone, at the decane-water interface was investigated using atomistic MD simulations. We consider {{a series of}} surfactant isomers in the family of alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonates,</b> denoted by m-C 16, indicating a <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonate</b> group attached to the mth carbon in a hexadecane backbone. The equilibrated model systems showed a well-defined interface between the decane and water phases. We find that surfactant 4 -C 16 has a more compact packing, {{in terms of the}} interfacial area and molecular alignment at the interface, than other surfactants simulated in this study. Furthermore, surfactant 4 -C 16 leads to the most stable interface by having the lowest interface formation energy. The interfacial thickness is the largest in the case of surfactant 4 -C 16, with the thickness decreasing when the <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonate</b> is located farther from the attachment position of 4 -C 16 (the 4 th carbon). The interfacial tension profile was calculated along the direction perpendicular to the interface using the Kirkwood-Buff theory. From the comparison of the interfacial tension obtained from the interfacial tension profile, we found that surfactant 4 -C 16 induces the lowest interfacial tension and that the interfacial tension increases with decreasing interfacial thickness {{as a function of the}} attachment position of <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonate.</b> Such a relationship between the interfacial thickness and interfacial tension is rationalized in terms of the miscibility of the alkyl tail of surfactant m-C 16 with decane by comparing the “effective...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the electrochemical oxidation of anionic surfactants. In particular, a synthetic solution of sodium dodecyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonate</b> and a real car wash wastewater were treated by galvanostatic electrolysis using a Ti–Ru–Sn ternary oxide and a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. Measurements of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and the concentration of the anionic surfactants were used to follow the oxidation. Using the Ti–Ru–Sn ternary oxide anode, the complete removal of COD and sodium dodecyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonate</b> was obtained only {{in the presence of}} chloride ions that act as inorganic mediators. The oxidation rate was almost independent of current density and electrolyte flow rate. In the case of BDD the mineralisation of the sodium dodecyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonate</b> was achieved in all experimental conditions due to reaction with hydroxyl radicals electrogenerated on the diamond surface during electrolysis. The COD removal rate increased with increase in electrolyte flow rate, indicating that the oxidation was mass-transfer controlled.

Based on the simulated results, we verdict the interfacial assignment of branched-alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulfonates</b> at the oil-water interface, and discuss the effect of hydrophobic tail structure on surfactant assignment. Bigger hydrophobic size can slow the change rate of surfactant occupied area as steric hindrance, and surfactant meta hydrophobic tails have a stronger tendency to stretch to the oil phase below the collapsed concentration.
