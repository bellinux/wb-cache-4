5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bees are}} polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E
5|$|For {{surface water}} {{sources such as}} lakes and reservoirs, the volume {{available}} for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO4) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, {{with the possible exception}} of fluorine. The elements iron, manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.|$|E

25|$|In the Torah, salt {{symbolizes the}} eternal {{covenant}} with God. As a preservative, the mineral never spoils or decays, signifying the immortality of this bond. Moreover, adding <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> food, salt represents a covenant with God that has meaning and flavor.|$|E

2500|$|Whereas {{wines are}} {{regularly}} tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in {{what are known}} as tasting [...] "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their vintage ("horizontal" [...] tasting) or proceed from a single winery ("vertical" [...] <b>tasting),</b> <b>to</b> better compare vineyard and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a [...] "blind" [...] <b>tasting,</b> <b>to</b> rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.|$|R

25|$|Mämmi, or Easter Porridge, is a {{traditional}} Finnish Lenten food. Cooked from rye malt and -flour, mämmi has a great resemblance (in recipe, colour and <b>taste)</b> <b>to</b> Samanū.

25|$|Since some cooking {{vessels and}} {{utensils}} (such as ceramic dishes and wooden spoons) are porous, {{it is possible}} for them to become infused with the taste of certain foods and transfer this <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> other foods. For example, if a frying pan is used to fry beef sausage, and is then used a few hours later to fry an omelette with cheese, a slight taste of the sausage might linger.|$|E
25|$|Their eating {{quality is}} very good. Their flesh {{is white and}} sweet when cooked, and has very little oil, making it similar in <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> snapper or grouper. Also, they are not {{excessively}} bony. However, most professional American anglers recommend practicing catch and release for these species to protect their numbers in the United States. To help ensure this, Florida Wildlife and Game Commission officers strictly enforce bag limits for these fish.|$|E
25|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} into India through the Chikmagalur district {{when the first}} coffee crop was grown in the baba budan giri range during 1670 AD. According to the article Origins of Coffee, the saint Baba Budan on his pilgrimage to Mecca travelled through the seaport of Mocha, Yemen where he discovered coffee. To introduce its <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> India, he wrapped seven coffee beans around his belly and got them out of Arabia. On his return home, he planted the beans {{in the hills of}} Chikmagalur.|$|E

40|$|Many {{results from}} lattice QCD of broad {{importance}} to particle and nuclear physics are obtained with 2 + 1 flavors of staggered sea quarks. In the continuum limit, staggered fermions yield four species, called <b>tastes.</b> <b>To</b> {{reduce the number}} of <b>tastes</b> <b>to</b> one (per flavor), the simulation employs the fourth root of the four-taste staggered fermion determinant. This talk surveys evidence in favor of this procedure, refutes recent criticisms, and reviews recent algorithmic and technical improvements. Physics results are covered in other plenary talks.

25|$|After Zach Ramsay's disappearance, Bar-Jonah {{also began}} to hold cookouts {{in which he was}} {{reported}} to serve burgers, spaghetti, chili, meat pies, casseroles, and the like to guests. At many of these cookouts, a number of persons told Bar-Jonah that the meat had a peculiar <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> it; Bar-Jonah's response was that he had gone deer hunting and used the deer meat in the dishes. However, Bar-Jonah did not own a rifle or a hunting license, nor had he been deer hunting at any time.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{claimed that}} the sinking ship scenes were {{inspired}} by the Titanic sinking which had occurred the previous year. However, Blom based his film entirely on Gerhardt Hauptmann's 1912 novel, Atlantis. Hauptmann's novel was published in serialized form in the Berliner Tageblatt {{a month before the}} Titanic disaster. Nevertheless, due to the film’s release only one year after the Titanic sinking, Atlantis became associated with the Titanic. In Norway, the film was banned because authorities felt it was in poor <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> turn a tragedy into entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Heritage turkeys {{have been}} praised by chefs and food critics alike as being richer in flavor than {{industrial}} birds, though {{the lack of}} a large amount of breast meat means cooking times and methods may differ substantially from non-heritage birds. Heritage turkeys are closer in <b>taste</b> <b>to</b> wild turkeys, but are several pounds larger. Part of this stated increase in flavor is due to a difference in the maturity between industrial turkeys and heritage ones - if birds are slaughtered at less than four months old, they fail to ever accrue fat layers.|$|E
