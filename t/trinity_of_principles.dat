Among all cusanus works the term “possest” only appears in three texts called “late period”. Appears on De apice theoriae (1464) probably the last work written by Nicholas of Cusa. In turn, the De venatione sapientiae (1463) the possest will be the second field, immediately after and before the learned ignorance of non aliud, which takes hunting wisdom. The themes taken up in De venatione sapientiae been deeply addressed in De possest (1460) that constitutes as a “trialogue” between Nicholas of Cusa, Bernardo of Krayburg, chancellor of the Archbishop of Salzburg, and John André Vigevio, secretary of Nicholas and then bishop of Aleria...|$|R

5000|$|From this {{universal}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{faith of}} the New Church, the Divine Trinity is defined as [...] "the three essentials of one God, and they make one as soul, body, and operation make one in man.

[...] As a <b>trinity</b> <b>of</b> soul, body and spirit exists in every man, so in Jesus this became the Holy Trinity. It is this doctrine of one God as one person which distinguishes the New Church from other Christian churches, most of which define the Trinity as three persons existing from eternity. The doctrine of three persons is regarded as inherently illogical by the New Church: [...] "In the ideas <b>of</b> thought a <b>Trinity</b> <b>of</b> Divine Persons from eternity, or before the world was created, is a <b>Trinity</b> <b>of</b> Gods; and these ideas cannot be effaced by a lip-confession of one God." ...|$|R
