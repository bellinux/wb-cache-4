5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led {{the remainder of his}} men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{decided to}} convert the Jews in Hungary to Catholicism around 1360. After {{experiencing}} resistance, he expelled them from his realms. Their immovable property was confiscated, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to take their personal property with them and also to recover the loans they had made. No pogrom took place, which was unusual in Europe in the 14th century, according to historian Raphael Patai.|$|E
5|$|Most other revolutionaries were {{detained}} {{in areas of}} present-day Bulgaria until spring 1849, and, passing through Rustchuk and Varna, {{were taken to the}} Anatolian city of Brusa, where they lived {{at the expense of the}} Ottoman state. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to return after 1856. During their period of exile, rivalry between the various factions became obvious, a conflict which became the basis for political allegiances in later years.|$|E

5|$|Queens Park Rangers's strip for {{the final}} was all-white, instead of their normal white and blue hoops. West Browmwich Albion wore their away strip, which was all-red. Each team's {{supporters}} {{did not have a}} limit on the number of tickets <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to purchase. This was despite a limit of 15,000 for FA Cup finals which were also held at Wembley. A crowd of nearly 100,000 was expected to be inside the stadium, although only highlights were to be shown on television.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Chamber Music Society, {{founded by}} Hugo Weisgall and Rudolph Rothschild in 1950, has {{commissioned}} {{a number of}} renowned works and is known {{for a series of}} controversial concerts featuring mostly 20th-century composers. The Baltimore Women's String Symphony Orchestra was led by Stephen Deak and Wolfgang Martin from 1936 to 1940, a time when women were barred from the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> in the Baltimore Colored Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
5|$|The Ordainers {{also took}} care to confirm and {{elaborate}} on existing statutes, and reforms {{were made to the}} criminal law. The liberties of the church were confirmed as well. To ensure that none of the Ordainers should be swayed in their decisions by bribes from the king, restrictions were made on what royal gifts and offices <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to receive during their tenure.|$|E

5|$|The Polish {{soldiers}} {{serving in}} the Dąbrowski Legion were granted Lombardian citizenship and were paid the same wage as other troops. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> {{to use their own}} unique Polish-style uniforms, with some French and Lombardian symbols, and were commanded by other Polish speakers. By early February 1797 the Legion was 1,200 strong, having been bolstered by the arrival of many new recruits who had deserted from the Austrian army.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{decided to}} transfer Sitting Bull {{and his band}} to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota) on the southern border of the state. There they spent the next 20 months. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes were}} {{primarily}} shot in Quiapo, Manila, church scenes {{were recorded in}} Iguig and dream sequences in Currimao, Ilocos Norte. Guillen noted the stress of recording in Quiapo, due to {{the large number of}} extras, the already crowded nature of the area and the small size of the time periods during which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to film in the church itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{terms of}} {{surrender}} {{were that the}} British and their camp followers {{would be allowed to}} withdraw, under French escort, to Fort Edward, with the full honours of war, on condition that they refrain from fighting for 18 months. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to keep their muskets and a single symbolic cannon, but no ammunition. In addition, British authorities were to release French prisoners within three months.|$|E
5|$|When the {{consideration}} {{was made that}} the ambulance drivers' weapons incident just prior to Centaur's voyage may have been partially responsible for the attack, {{it led to the}} tightening of rules regarding who was allowed to travel on a hospital ship. Quasi-medical staff, like repatriation teams, were no longer permitted on hospital ships. Ambulance drivers had to transfer from the regular Army to the Australian Army Medical Corps before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> aboard, although they were still permitted to carry their unloaded weapons and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Bede relates {{that after}} the mission's arrival in Kent and {{conversion}} of the king, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to restore and rebuild old Roman churches for their use. One such was Christ Church, Canterbury, which became Augustine's cathedral church. Archaeological evidence for other Roman churches having been rebuilt is slight, but the church of St Pancras in Canterbury has a Roman building at its core, although {{it is unclear whether}} that older building was a church during the Roman era. Another possible site is Lullingstone, in Kent, where a religious site dating to 300 was found underneath an abandoned church.|$|E

5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires {{have been allowed to}} burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{refusal to}} give the Dutch access to plans {{detailing}} {{the design of the}} Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a major problem. Inexperienced in designing an underwater protection scheme for a ship of this size, the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance, which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940. Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing technical drawings or the battleship , then under construction, possibly to ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to visit , toured several shipyards, interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy, and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts, the ItaliansGermany's allyknowing some details of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned {{of the dangers of}} asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E

5|$|Not all slaves had {{the same}} social status. Some slaves of wealthy {{families}} lived better than commoners since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to wear luxurious clothes and consume quality food and wine. Slaves of high officials could even be feared and respected. The slaves of regent Huo Guang (d. 68 BCE) sometimes came armed to the marketplace and fought commoners, forced the Imperial Secretary to kowtow and apologize (after a scuffle with his slaves over the right-of-way on the street), and were provided services by some officials who sought a promotion through Huo Guang's influence.|$|E
5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{agreed to}} help the King attack Lisbon, with a solemn {{agreement}} that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The Siege of Lisbon lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, {{but some of them}} set sail and continued to the Holy Land. Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped capture Santarém earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer Sintra, Almada, Palmela and Setúbal, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.|$|E
