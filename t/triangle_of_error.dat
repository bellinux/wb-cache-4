Before I have created program capable of detecting and repairing some <b>of</b> <b>triangle</b> mesh <b>errors.</b> Main goal <b>of</b> creation such a program was a research using scans of human faces at Faculty of Anthropology of Nature Science at Charles University in Prague. There are analyzed issues and there are evaluated existing solution in this paper. In second section I describe implemented algorithms, user's and programmer's documentation as well.

40|$|This paper puts {{forward a}} novel concept of {{tetrahedron}} model <b>of</b> chart cartography <b>error</b> analysis and quality control which {{is necessary for}} introducing user to the former <b>triangle</b> model <b>of</b> <b>error</b> analysis and quality control, i. e. Reality-Producer-Chart-User. For the human being, high quality does not necessarily represent high accuracy, but represent a concept that what is fit for use. Classical cartography error theory coming from physics and mathematics will no longer meet the requirement of users, so the new concept deriving from communication and cognition sciences will compensate for the research. New model should adopt thought science which is from humanities. In tetrahedron model, producer refers to people who provide data, who manipulate data and who check data. User is considered as a quality controlling factor which has equal status with producer. Data quality control has changed from “Check-Driving ” to “User-Driving”. The words for quality assessment change from error or uncertainty to practicability or applicability. Reality here refers to ocean and coastal zone. From a new viewpoint, the chart has been redefined as chart set. And characters of chart differing from terrain map and the specific quality assessment indexes have been discussed. Some innovative ideas of the research work were as follows: 1) Establishing a new tetrahedron model of quality control. The relationship between error and quality assessment was analyzed and practicability was adopted to assess the quality of chart product. 2) Defining the chart set. After changing from paper chart to electronic chart or digital chart, chart product become a set of digitizing collecting, storin...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} LEPP-surface {{triangulation}} method {{that starts with}} a coarse initial triangu-lation of input grid terrain data, and incrementally adds data points that reduce the worst edge approximation error in the mesh. The method generalizes a previous LEPP-centroid method in two dimensions as follows: for the edge e, having highest error in the mesh, one or two points close to (one or two) terminal edges associated to e, are inserted in the mesh. The edge error is computed by adding the <b>triangle</b> approximation <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> the two <b>triangles</b> that share e, while each triangle error in L 2 -norm is computed by using a curvature tensor (good approximation of the surface) at a representative point associated to both triangles. The method produces trian-gular approximations that capture well the relevant features of the terrain surface by naturally producing well-shaped triangles. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} anisotropy in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch by relating electrophysiology with anatomy. Background. Atrioventricular (AV) node fast and slow pathway characteristics have been suggested to be due to nonuniform anisotropy in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch. Methods. During atrial pacing, we determined the electrical activity within the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch by multichannel mapping in 11 isolated hearts from pigs and dogs. Orientation of fibers was determined in nine hearts. Results. Fibers were parallel to the tricuspid valve annulus (TVA) in the posterior part <b>of</b> the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch. In the midjunctional area, the direction of the fibers changed to an orientation perpendicular to the TVA. During stimulation from posterior and anterior sites, activation proceeded parallel to the TVA at a high conduction velocity (0. 5 to 0. 6 m/s). During stimulation from sites near the coronary sinus, a narrowzone of slow conduction occurred in the posterior part <b>of</b> the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch where activation proceeded perpendicular to the fiber orientation. Above and below this zone, conduction was fast and parallel to the annulus. After premature stimulation, conduction delay in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch increased by 4 to 21 ms; in contrast, the AH interval increased by 80 to 210 ms. Conclusions. Data support the concept of anisotropic conduction in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch. Activation maps correlated well with the arrangement of superficial atrial fibers. Comparison of conduction delay in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch and AH delay after premature stimulation disproves that anisotropy in the superficial layers plays an important role in slow AV conduction...|$|R
