5|$|On {{or about}} January 13, a <b>title</b> <b>key</b> was posted on pastebin.com {{in the form}} of a riddle, which was solved by {{entering}} terms into the Google search engine. By converting these results to hexadecimal, a correct key could be formed. Later that day, the first cracked HD DVD, Serenity, was uploaded on a private torrent tracker. The AACS LA confirmed on January 26 that the title keys on certain HD DVDs had been published without authorization.|$|E
25|$|Serenity was {{released}} on HD DVD on April 18, 2006 {{and was the first}} Universal Studios film to be released on the format. In January 2007, it also became the first full resolution rip of an HD DVD release uploaded to the BitTorrent network after its <b>title</b> <b>key</b> was ripped from a software player and released online.|$|E
50|$|The {{licensed}} replicator shall {{select a}} secret, random <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> for each Title to be protected. Each <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> shall {{be used to}} encrypt the content of its corresponding Title, as specified for each supported content format elsewhere in this specification. At the replicator’s discretion, a given Title may be encrypted using the same <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> for all instances of pre-recorded media, or different Title Keys {{may be used for}} different instances.|$|E
5000|$|To {{protect the}} content, the {{information}} units are encrypted using encryption <b>keys</b> called <b>Title</b> <b>Keys.</b> To achieve more security {{and so that}} the key obtention process cannot be obtained by player without license, the <b>Title</b> <b>Keys</b> are encrypted giving {{as a result the}} Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Keys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the process}} of {{updating}} all the <b>Title</b> <b>Keys</b> for an application usually takes a very small amount of time (much less than a second), it is a critical time. If the device were to fail during the re-encryption process, the user's content might be lost. To {{reduce the risk of}} user loss, recording devices shall begin the reencryption process by renaming the old MKB to a temporary name before writing the new MKB. When the device completes the re-encryption process, it shall delete the temporary MKB. If any recorder discovers a temporary MKB on a piece of media, it is an indication that the encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Keys</b> might be corrupted. Thedevice shall perform one of the following protocols to recover the corrupted encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Keys.</b> Which protocol is chosen depends on where the encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Keys</b> are stored in the particular application. A device re-encrypting <b>Title</b> <b>Keys</b> as a normal result of updating a recordable MKB shall also use these sameprotocols.|$|R
50|$|AACS uses {{cryptography}} {{to control}} and restrict the use of digital media. It encrypts content under one or more <b>title</b> <b>keys</b> using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). <b>Title</b> <b>keys</b> are decrypted {{using a combination of}} a media key (encoded in a Media Key Block) and the Volume ID of the media (e.g., a physical serial number embedded on a pre-recorded disc).|$|R
5000|$|To codify the Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key,</b> a {{codification}} is made {{following the}} next formula: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{players have}} some keys, {{according}} to each model, called Device Keys, which are {{granted by the}} AACS organization. In the reproduction moment, one of these keys decrypts the contained MKB in the disc {{and as a result}} of this process, the Media Key, is obtained.The Media Key is combined with the VID (Volume ID) and the Volume Unique Key (KVU) is originated so that the decryption of the Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> can finally be done and in consequence the necessary <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> is obtained to decrypt and reproduce the discs’ content.|$|E

5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} keys to device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 <b>keys</b> called <b>title</b> <b>keys</b> are generated and the video content on the disc is encrypted using these <b>keys.</b> The <b>title</b> <b>keys</b> are stored on the disc and themselves encrypted with another key called the volume unique key. The volume unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device keys to decrypt the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further decryption of the volume and <b>title</b> <b>keys,</b> and finally the content.|$|R
50|$|The Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Keys</b> {{are found}} in the Reading/Writing area with the Media Key Block, the Usage Rules and the {{encrypted}} content.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>title</b> <b>keys</b> {{and one of}} {{the keys}} used to decrypt them (known as Processing Keys in the AACS specifications) have been found by using debuggers to inspect the memory space of running HD DVD and Blu-ray player programs.|$|R
5000|$|... Recovery Protocol When the Encrypted Title Keys {{are in a}} Separate File:In this case, the {{original}} recording device shall rename the old encrypted Title Keys to a defined temporaryname before beginning to write the new encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> File.|$|E
50|$|Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> is an {{encrypted}} {{key that}} belongs to anticopy Advanced Access Content System (AACS). This key {{is included in the}} Media Key Block system and {{is an important part of}} the content protection process of Blu-ray and HD-DVD contents.|$|E
5000|$|...Recovery Protocol When the Encrypted Title Keys {{are in the}} Content File:In {{the extreme}} case, each content file {{contains}} its own encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key.</b> In that case, {{it is not likely}} that thereis a temporary version of the encrypted Title Keys.|$|E
50|$|On January 15, 2007 {{a website}} {{launched}} at HDKeys.com containing {{a database of}} HD DVD <b>title</b> <b>keys.</b> It also featured a modified copy of the BackupHDDVD software allowing for online key retrieval (the latter was later removed after a DMCA complaint).|$|R
50|$|The Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Keys</b> {{are located}} in the Blu-ray and HD-DVDs where there is content to {{reproduce}} by the player with license. The information stored in the discs is found divided in three different parts: Reading/Writing area, read-only area and protected area.|$|R
50|$|Blu-Ray or HD-DVD have as content the {{encrypted}} data (usually video), the Volume ID (VID), the Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key(s)</b> and the MKB. The MKB {{is also found}} encrypted in the disc {{to prevent it from}} being extracted off the disc and being manipulated and/or reproduced by another non authorized device.|$|R
5000|$|So {{that the}} players with license can achieve reading the discs’ content, there are some {{decryption}} procedures before achieving the reading. The discs have a volume identifier called VID (Volume ID), the Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> and a decryption key (Media Key Block).|$|E
50|$|The 1969-70 season saw Borussia Mönchengladbach {{win their}} first <b>title.</b> <b>Key</b> {{to their success}} was a, in {{comparison}} to the previous seasons, significantly improved defense. Mönchengladbach successfully held off Bayern Munich despite a record season of Bayern striker Gerd Müller, who scored 38 goals.|$|E
50|$|Development of Never Lose Hope {{began in}} 2012 {{with a small}} team within the indie studio Rayark, after a {{redirected}} attempt to create an XBOX <b>title.</b> <b>Key</b> influences included artificial intelligence and man-machine integration, which influenced the story, graphics and music while combining with typical cyberpunk elements.|$|E
50|$|In 2001 the {{structure}} was granted the <b>title</b> of <b>Key</b> Cultural Relics of the State.|$|R
5|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} that the player used by the utility's author to obtain keys would be revoked. Cyberlink, which sells the PowerDVD player software, was quick to deny that its software {{could be used to}} obtain keys. Corel was silent about the role its WinDVD software had played in the leaking of volume and <b>title</b> <b>keys.</b> Both companies have since released updates for their player software.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{spreading}} processing keys on the Internet, {{there have}} also been efforts to spread <b>title</b> <b>keys</b> on various sites.The AACS LA has sent DMCA takedown notices to such sites on at least one occasion.There is also commercial software (AnyDVD HD) that can circumvent the AACS protection. Apparently this program works even with movies released after the AACS LA expired the first batch of keys.|$|R

50|$|The Media key is {{combined}} {{together with the}} VID (Volume ID) {{and as a result}} we obtain the Volume Unique Key (Kvu). With the Kvu we are able to decrypt the Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> and obtain the Title keys which finally allows to decrypt the content of the disc and view it.|$|E

50|$|Once the MKB is decrypted, it {{provides}} the Media Key, or the km. The km is combined with the Volume ID (which the program can only get by presenting a cryptographic certificate to the drive, as described above) in a one-way encryption scheme (AES-G) to produce the Volume Unique Key (Kvu). The Kvu is used to decrypt the encrypted <b>title</b> <b>keys,</b> and {{that is used to}} decrypt the encrypted content.|$|R

50|$|A title {{sequence}} (also {{called an}} opening sequence or intro) is the {{method by which}} films or television programs present their <b>title,</b> <b>key</b> production and cast members, utilizing conceptual visuals and sound. It typically includes (or begins) {{the text of the}} opening credits, and helps establish the setting and tone of the program. It may consist of live action, animation, music, still images, and/or graphics.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{objective}} of the Encrypted <b>Title</b> <b>Key</b> is to reinforce the discs’ content security during the decryption process of content stored in this media. The content stored in medias like Blu-ray or HD-DVDs is composed and divided in information units called Titles. The owner of the protected contents, divide this information {{in the form of}} one or more Titles. It also provides a license to the player, a series of rules called Usage Rules which will be used later on to decrypt the disc information.|$|E
5000|$|In principle, this {{approach}} allows licensors to [...] "revoke" [...] a given player model (prevent it from playing back future content) by omitting to encrypt future <b>title</b> <b>keys</b> with the player model's key. In practice, however, revoking all players of a particular model is costly, as it causes many users to lose playback capability. Furthermore, {{the inclusion of a}} shared key across many players makes key compromise significantly more likely, as was demonstrated by a number of compromises in the mid-1990s.|$|R

5|$|On January 2, 2007, {{the author}} posted the 1.0 {{version of the}} BackupHDDVD utility, which {{included}} support for the decoding of discs using volume keys. For several weeks following the utility's release no success using the author's key extraction technique was reported. In mid-January 2007, a volume key was published by {{another member of the}} Doom9 forum along with an explanation of the technique used to obtain it. Other forum members quickly discovered <b>keys</b> for different <b>titles.</b> <b>Keys</b> for many discs are now readily available on the internet.|$|R
