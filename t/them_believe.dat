25|$|French mathematician, Minim friar, and {{painter of}} {{anamorphic}} art Jean-François Nicéron (1613-1646) {{wrote about the}} camera obscura with convex lenses. He explained how the camera obscura {{could be used by}} painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the camera obscura to fool witless spectators and make <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of La Perspective Curieuse (1652).|$|E
25|$|The Aryan theory {{served to}} provide the colonised Indians with status and self-esteem, making <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> that they are of the same stock as the colonisers, linguistically and racially. However, Christian missionaries such as John Muir and John Wilson drew {{attention}} to the plight of lower castes, who they said were oppressed by the upper castes since the Aryan invasions. Jyotiba Phule argued that the dasas and sudras were indigenous people and the rightful inheritors of the land, whereas Brahmins were Aryan and alien.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2010 study {{published}} by the University of Colorado Boulder, {{the vast majority of}} Abkhazia's population supports independence, while a smaller number is in favour of joining the Russian Federation. Support for a reunification with Georgia is very low. Even among ethnic Georgians, nearly 50% prefer Abkhazia to remain an independent state and less than 20% of <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> returning to Georgia is necessary, as most of them have adjusted to the current situation. Among ethnic Abkhaz, explicit support for reunification with Georgia is around 1%; a similar figure can be found among ethnic Russians and Armenians as well.|$|E

25|$|Harvard {{students}} Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> {{he would}} help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU). They filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter {{in federal court in}} Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{more than}} 100 men had {{said they were}} {{tortured}} on the South Side under Burge's watch. In addition to suffering electric shock, they told stories of police putting a loaded gun in their mouth or a typewriter cover over their head to make <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> they would die. On the basis of newly discovered evidence, the Chicago Police Department in 1993 fired Burge, having {{found that there was}} “systematic” torture at Area 2. In 1994, Taylor, together with law partners Joey Mogul and Tim Lohraff, began representing death row inmate Aaron Patterson, who alleged that he was tortured by Burge and his men into a coerced confession.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of their earliest area of settlement is disputed: {{a group of}} historians proposes that the group was probably tasked with defending the Byzantine border to the north, and settled in and around what later became known as Babadag, while another one centers this presence on the Southern Dobrujan strip of land known as Kaliakra (presently in Bulgaria). In addition, various historians argue that this Seljuq migration was the decisive contributor to the ethnogenesis of the Gagauz people, which, some of <b>them</b> <b>believe,</b> could also have involved the Cumans, Pechenegs, Oghuz and other Turkic peoples. The Gagauz, few of whom have endured in Dobruja, are majority Eastern Orthodox, a fact which was attributed to a process of religious conversion from Islam.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is all I have to say," [...] said Dirk in his usual voice. [...] "No, it is not all," [...] and he told them of his plan for flight. They listened and agreed to it, yet to them it seemed a thing far off and unreal. None of <b>them</b> <b>believed</b> that this escape would ever be carried out. All of <b>them</b> <b>believed</b> that here in Leyden they would endure the fiery trial of their faith and win each of them its {{separate}} crown.|$|R

25|$|Collins told McMurdo Station that {{he would}} be {{dropping}} to , at which point he switched control of the aircraft to the automated computer system. Outside there was a layer of clouds that blended with the white of the snow-covered volcano, forming a sector whiteout – there was no contrast between the two to warn the pilots. The effect deceived everyone on the flight deck, making <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> that the white mountainside was the Ross Ice Shelf, a huge expanse of floating ice derived from the great ice sheets of Antarctica, which was in fact now behind the mountain. As it was little understood, even by experienced polar pilots, Air New Zealand had provided no training for the flight crew on the sector whiteout phenomenon. Consequently, the crew thought they were flying along McMurdo Sound, when they were flying over Lewis Bay in front of Mt.Erebus.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Bahrag and the Bohrok's return to their nests, the Toa Nuva collect their new Kanohi Nuva masks and return to their villages to help in the {{reconstruction}} after the damage the swarms caused. However, six new elite Bohrok - the Bohrok-Kal - appear with the intention of releasing the Bahrag so the Bohrok may swarm again. Each Kal steals a Nuva symbol tablet, robbing the heroes of their command of the elements. Relying solely on their mask powers and combat skills, the Toa Nuva chase the Bohrok-Kal all over Mata Nui and eventually find them in the Bahrag's underground nest. The Kal defeat the Exo-Toa guards with ease before attempting to fit all six plaques onto the Nuva cube in order to re-awake the swarm queens. Before the tablets join, Tahu unleashes a secret weapon: the Kanohi Vahi - the legendary Mask of Time - to slow down time around them. Though unable to directly attack the Kal, the gambit buys the Toa time to devise a new strategy. Using their connections to their tablets, they feed energy into the elite Bohrok, making <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> that their power alone can cleanse the island. However, the Kal's powers soon run wild and destroy them. The Toa Nuva exit the nest, and after hiding their tablets in secret locations, enjoy a new time of peace on Mata Nui.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{wrote out}} his sermons before preaching and marked his words {{to provide the}} correct {{pronunciation}} or to emphasise the word ironically. He always practised reading his sermons, and, as Davis claims, [...] "he would (in his own expression) pick up the lines, and cheat his people, by making <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> he had it all by heart." [...] However, he wanted to express the truth of his words and impart this truth in a down-to-earth manner that could be understood by his listeners.|$|E

500|$|Loudspeakers {{broadcast}} the performance {{throughout the city}} {{as well as to}} the German forces in a move of psychological warfare, a [...] "tactical strike against German morale". One German soldier recalled how his squadron [...] "listened to the symphony of heroes". Eliasberg later met with some of the Germans who camped outside Leningrad during the performance, who told him that it had made <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> they would never capture the city: [...] "Who are we bombing? We will never be able to take Leningrad because the people here are selfless".|$|E
500|$|Head writer Maria Arena Bell {{dedicated}} the 4th of July episode to Sharon, {{stating that}} the episode would [...] "shed more light on Sharon and all the factors that caused her {{to be in this}} situation, why she's acted the way she has and why she's gone into the pit of [...] self-esteem." [...] Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the [...] "unforgivable things" [...] she has done (especially her devious move of letting <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> she was dead). Jones further said: [...] "Some will say she did what she thought she had to do. Even though it seemed as if it was easy, it's never that easy {{to walk away from the}} people you love".|$|E
500|$|Due to Skanderbeg's [...] "disappearance," [...] rumors {{began to}} spread that he had fled since {{he was unable to}} confront the Ottomans and that his men had betrayed him. This was further upheld by the Venetians in Durazzo (Durrës). Isak bey and Hamza {{continued}} to be wary, however, and their reconnaissance forces reached as far north as Scutari (Shkodër). Skanderbeg remained in the mountains throughout July and August. It is not known with certainty what his army did while in the mountains, but he planned to wear the Ottomans out by forcing them to wait and to make <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> that he had been decisively defeated. Skanderbeg then sent Gjergj(George) Pjetri to Rome as an ambassador to give the Pope the impression that Albania had been decisively conquered and that aid was necessary to force the Ottomans out of Albania. On 17 September 1457, Calixtus notified Skanderbeg that he had sent Johan Navarre to help fund the crusade. By the time he arrived, however, the situation had already changed.|$|E

500|$|Part of the {{attraction}} for the writers {{is that they}} are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but {{can be used as a}} segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer David Mirkin among <b>them,</b> <b>believe</b> that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] has been described by Mirkin as being one of [...] "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that [...] "if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow." [...] However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it [...] "a societal thing". [...] He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like Coraline, and that, [...] " [...] the age of scary stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lamont noted Lieberman's {{position}} {{was similar to}} George W. Bush and Dick Cheney's position. Lamont said, “That comment sounds {{an awful lot like}} Vice President Cheney’s comment on Wednesday. Both of <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> our invasion of Iraq {{has a lot to do}} with 9/11. That’s a false premise.” [...] Lieberman's communications director replied that Lamont was politicizing national security by [...] "portraying [...] as a soul mate of President Bush on Iraq".|$|E
2500|$|The {{success in}} the {{hospital}} wards made <b>them</b> <b>believe</b> {{success in the}} community would be possible. So it was {{the combination of a}} hospital's architectural layout and a physician's driving and persuasive personality that provided the impetus for this breakthrough. But one cannot discount the resuscitation infrastructure already in place: [...] mouth-to-mouth ventilation, chest compression, and portable defibrillation. Without each of these three elements the Belfast program would have been {{a waste of time and}} effort.|$|E
2500|$|These criticisms {{have been}} leveled by {{large and small}} {{manufacturers}} alike.
