5|$|Lam Tin has an {{underground}} network of safe water, <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> and domestic electricity supplies. Electricity {{in the area}} is served by China Light and Power. <b>Town</b> <b>gas</b> in the area is served by the Towngas Company.|$|E
5|$|The Stretford {{process was}} {{developed}} at the North-Western Gas Board's laboratories in Stretford, during the 1940s. It was the first liquid phase, oxidation process for removing hydrogen sulphide (H2S) from <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> to gain widespread commercial acceptance. Many Stretford plants were built worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Electricity is {{supplied}} by Northern Ireland Electricity which was privatised in 1993 {{and is now}} a subsidiary of ESB Group. The gasworks used to be in North St., but {{there is no longer any}} <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> since it was abolished in Northern Ireland in the 1980s by the Thatcher government for being uneconomical, although it was restored to the greater Belfast area in 1996. Water {{is supplied}} by Northern Ireland Water, a public owned utility.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, this is {{the reason}} why the school, post office moved out of <b>town,</b> the <b>gas</b> station closed down and why many of the towns people moved out.|$|R
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century many of the county's <b>towns</b> {{received}} <b>gas</b> lighting {{for the first time}} – Enniscorthy, for example, around the 1850-60s. The 19th century also saw the arrival of the Railways in the county.|$|R
50|$|Winton is {{situated}} on the Great Artesian Basin. The water supply bursts to the surface at 83 °C and is then channelled through cooling ponds before being distributed to the <b>town.</b> Sulphur <b>gas</b> gives the water an 'eggy' smell.|$|R
25|$|The Geelong Gas Company was {{a private}} company set up to produce and {{distribute}} <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> {{in the city of}} Geelong. From a gasworks in North Geelong it converted coal into <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> for use in homes and industry. The company was founded in 1858 and existed until 1971 when Geelong was converted to natural gas and the company was bought out by the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Fishburn {{coking plant}} {{was built in}} 1954 {{alongside}} the colliery to produce high grade coke for industry and a coke for the domestic market called Sunbrite {{as well as other}} byproducts from the coking process such as <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> which was supplied directly to the nearby Winterton Hospital and to the national grid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Town</b> <b>gas</b> was {{introduced}} in 1836 when a gas works was built in Station Road, using coal brought to Coultershaw wharf by barge and later by rail to Petworth railway station. A monument which stands {{at the north end}} of East Street was given by the townspeople to show their gratitude to the earl.|$|E

25|$|A small host of stereotypical {{characters}} greeted Allen and Hoffa {{down the}} Alley, discussing Allen's {{question of the}} week, usually drawing on news items or popular happenings around <b>town,</b> whether <b>gas</b> rationing, traffic congestion, the Pulitzer Prizes, postwar holiday travel, or the annual Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus visit.|$|R
25|$|The <b>town</b> {{received}} <b>gas</b> lighting in 1833. The corporation {{became a}} borough council in 1835. Little Gonerby and Spittlegate {{were added to}} the borough in 1879. The town had been in the wapentake of Loveden, and the town included three townships of Manthorpe with Little Gonerby, Harrowby, and Spittlegate with Houghton and Walton.|$|R
25|$|The {{discovery}} of abundant reserves {{of natural gas}} in Bass Strait shook up <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> production. On 16 March 1967 a letter of intent was signed by the Geelong Gas Company with the Esso Exploration and Production of Australia Ltd and Haematite Petroleum Pty Ltd to buy natural gas from their Bass Strait gas fields for a 20-year period.|$|E
25|$|During gasification, {{the coal}} {{is mixed with}} oxygen and steam while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water {{molecules}} oxidize the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing hydrogen gas (H2). This process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and {{in the production of}} <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.|$|E
25|$|<b>Town</b> <b>gas</b> is a {{flammable}} {{gaseous fuel}} {{made by the}} destructive distillation of coal. It contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other volatile hydrocarbons, together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and is used {{in a similar way}} to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 {{the city}} adopted a {{policy for the}} {{elimination}} of the use of fossil fuels by 2030. This decision was taken in reaction to pollution and eutrophication in the lakes that surround the <b>town.</b> Greenhouse <b>gas</b> emissions were cut by 41% from 1993 to 2011, and were reduced by 55% by 2015. The city's economy has grown during this time.|$|R
50|$|A Lưới is {{connected}} to the former French colonial capital and coastal city, Huế, one of the main historical cities in central Vietnam by National Road 49, a road notorious for poor safety because of the mountainous terrain and poor road surface. The A Lưới District has one town and 21 communes. The central <b>town</b> has <b>gas</b> stations, and a few guest-houses for travelers.|$|R
50|$|The {{place has}} the {{potential}} to yield information about the evolving technology of manufacture and distribution of <b>town</b> and natural <b>gas</b> in Brisbane and northern Brisbane suburbs over a period of 125 years.|$|R
25|$|By the 1960s {{production}} of gas from coal was an obsolete technology. By 1963 the Geelong Gas Company had changed production methods, using an Onia Gegi reforming plant to convert hydrocarbon gases from the Shell oil refinery at Corio into <b>town</b> <b>gas.</b> The new reforming plant was visited by many other gas companies {{as an example}} of modern Syngas technology. The former coal carbonising equipment was only used when coke (a by-product of the gasification process) was required.|$|E
25|$|A ground source {{heat pump}} {{was used to}} heat the {{building}} in the winter and cool the building in the summer. Water was extracted from The Thames below Hungerford Bridge using a centrifugal pump. Heat was extracted from the river water using a heat pump. The compressors were driven by two Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, adapted to run on <b>town</b> <b>gas.</b> It was not successful due to overheating the building and other problems and was removed early on.|$|E
25|$|The company {{continued}} to expand, with a factory producing ammonium sulfate opening in 1865 in Raderberg near Cologne (incorporated into Cologne in 1888). This factory produced the ammonium sulfate from ammonia and sulfuric acid, the latter a waste {{product of the}} production of <b>town</b> <b>gas.</b> As the new factory was highly profitable, Vorster & Grüneberg opened new ammonium sulfate factories in Nippes, Cologne (incorporated into Cologne in 1888), Düsseldorf, Essen, Dortmund, Hamburg, Leipzig and Saint Petersburg and an ammonium chloride factory in Moscow.|$|E
50|$|United Illuminating is the {{exclusive}} distributor of electric {{power to the}} <b>town.</b> Natural <b>gas</b> is distributed by the Southern Connecticut Gas Company with several sections being served by local propane distribution companies. AT&T is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Phone service is also available from various national wireless companies and the local cable television provider. Cable television is available from Comcast and AT&T. Satellite television is available from AT&T (Dish Network) and DirecTV.|$|R
50|$|To honour {{the memory}} of their esteemed physician, a public {{subscription}} was raised in Cairns to fund a memorial which would be not only aesthetically pleasing, but functional, and Messrs Melrose and Fenwick of Townsville were commissioned to design a memorial {{in the form of}} a drinking fountain. As it was to be located in the centre of the intersection of Abbott and Spence Streets in the heart of the <b>town,</b> a <b>gas</b> lamp was placed on its top.|$|R
5000|$|Discovery of Natural Gas and {{construction}} of barrage across Indus River has transformed Guddu, Sindh, Pakistan into a modern <b>town.</b> The <b>gas</b> from Sui Gas Field {{has made it possible}} to develop Pakistan's one of the largest thermal generation complex Guddu Thermal Station. Plants for the construction of first phase of Guddu Power Project took off in 1969.The Guddu Thermal Power Station can generate 2400+Megawatts but it's only generating less than half of its production limit ...|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} {{producing}} energy using the gasification method {{has been in}} use for more than 180 years. In the early time coal and peat were used to power these plants. Initially developed to produce <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> for lighting and cooking in the 1800s, this was replaced by electricity and natural gas, it was also used in blast furnaces but the bigger role was played {{in the production of}} synthetic chemicals where it has been in use since the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|In the Colonial era {{the energy}} {{policy of the}} United States was for free use of {{standing}} timber for heating and industry. In the 19th century, new {{emphasis was placed on}} access to coal and its use for transport, heating and industry. Whales were rendered into lamp oil. Later, coal gas was fractionated for use as lighting and <b>town</b> <b>gas.</b> Natural gas was first used in America for lighting in 1816., it has grown in importance for use in homes, industry, and power plants, but natural gas production reached its U.S. peak in 1973, and the price has risen significantly since then.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s onwards, {{there were}} gradual but steady {{improvements}} to the inadequate sewage works and sewers built during the Victorian era in the urban areas, but this was expensive, and took time to complete. The changes were helped {{by the introduction of}} more stringent pollution control legislation, which required industrial waste to be discharged to sewers, and the formation of the Trent River Authority, which had new duties relating to managing water quality issues. Other changes, such as the replacement of <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> with natural gas, saw the end of the polluting and toxic coal tar emissions to rivers in 1963.|$|E
50|$|The major {{use of the}} Wells {{light was}} for the {{illumination}} of outdoor construction work. They were portable and simple to operate. Their fuel was cheap and commonly available, especially as the Wells' pressure burner could burn a much lower and cheaper grade of oil than the lamp paraffin that was pure enough to not clog a wick lamp. Oil fuels were still more expensive than coal gas though, so fixed lighting, such as in factories, remained on <b>town</b> mains <b>gas.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} about 20 to 25 Mohallas (regions) in the town, and 50 to 60 Masajid (Mosques), {{but the number}} of Mosques increases as the population grows. There is one boys high school, in Mohallah Munawwar Abad, one girls high school, a hospital, in Mohallah Sainchee Abad(bordering Malak Mala village) and five banks. The <b>town</b> has <b>gas,</b> electricity and telephone, and a Police station. The centre of the administration, Union Council, is also situated in Mohallah Munawwar Abad, next to the boys high school.|$|R
50|$|San Rafael, {{often called}} Guatuso, is an {{agricultural}} {{town on the}} Río Frío and Highway 4. Cattle ranching and rice farming are major concerns in the area. The <b>town</b> has a <b>gas</b> station, banks, medical clinic, pharmacy, and a few basic restaurants and cabinas for lodging.|$|R
25|$|From its {{original}} development until the wide-scale adoption of natural gas, more than 50,000 manufactured gas plants {{were in existence}} in the United States alone. The process of manufacturing gas usually produced a number of by-products that contaminated the soil and groundwater {{in and around the}} manufacturing plant, so many former <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> plants are a serious environmental concern, and cleanup and remediation costs are often high. Manufactured gas plants (MGPs) were typically sited near or adjacent to waterways that were used to transport in coal and for the discharge of wastewater contaminated with tar, ammonia and/or drip oils, as well as outright waste tars and tar-water emulsions.|$|E
25|$|This {{period is}} characterised by periods of slow to {{moderate}} population growth, with industrial and education industries developing {{and technology and}} services delivered to the town. Several major infrastructure developments arrive such as distributed <b>town</b> <b>gas,</b> electricity, town water supplies, and a sewage treatment system. <b>Town</b> <b>gas</b> had arrived in Bathurst courtesy of a private venture in 1872, with the Council providing a competing network from 1888. On 30 June 1914, the Council purchased the Wark Bros gas system and combined the gas networks. The old gasworks plant on Russell Street (now out of use) was built in 1960. In 1987 natural gas arrived via a new 240km spur pipeline off the Moomba to Sydney pipeline. The {{early part of the}} century saw electricity arrive initially for street lighting; the city converted from gas street lighting to electric lighting on 22 December 1924, when 370 electric lights at a cost of ₤40,000 were switched on. Lighting spread along streets through to 1935, over time to businesses and finally private houses. Sewage treatment was an early infrastructure project funded by the state government and built in 1915. Water supply started with private wells in backyards. Eventually a waterworks was built to the south of the town on the river with the water pumped through piping laid progressively to the businesses and private dwellings. In 1931, work started on the 1,700 ML Winburndale Dam project to gravity feed water through a wood stave pipe laid to the town. The scheme was opened by the Premier of New South Wales on 7 October 1933. Later, a new larger water supply dam was built on the Campbells River. Originally known as the Campbell River Dam scheme and later renamed the Ben Chifley Dam after the late Prime Minister Ben Chifley of Bathurst. It was opened in November 1956. The Ben Chifley Dam received a major storage upgrade designed to meet the cities needs to 2050; the work was completed in 2001 increasing the capacity by 30% to 30,800 ML.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available {{at the touch of}} a switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets to the majority of urban households. The invention of the gas meter and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s played an important role in selling <b>town</b> <b>gas</b> to domestic and commercial customers.|$|E
5000|$|Solen has {{one high}} school, Solen Public High School, nicknamed the [...] "Solen Sioux". The <b>town</b> has a <b>gas</b> station and {{automotive}} repair shop called Hoffman's Garage {{which has been}} family owned and operated since the early 1900s {{as well as a}} local bar, Last Chance Saloon.|$|R
50|$|Cockermouth lays {{claim to}} be the first town in Britain to have piloted {{electric}} lighting. In 1881 six powerful electric lamps were set up to light the <b>town,</b> together with <b>gas</b> oil lamps in the back streets. Service proved intermittent, and there was afterwards a return to gas lighting.|$|R
50|$|The harbor is chiefly {{important}} for its fishing and boat-building trades, while in <b>town</b> there are <b>gas,</b> chemical and mineral-oil works, {{as well as}} the manufacture of woolen and cotton goods, glass, biscuits, sugar and brandy. The surrounding fertile plains produce an abundance of grain, wine and fruit.|$|R
