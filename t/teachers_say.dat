500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus, Nicholas J. Scapa, John Read Fasse, Michael McGinnis, Antonina Armato and Tim James. It was {{produced}} by the latter three under their stage name Rock Mafia. The song serves as the opening track of Can't Be Tamed (2010). In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News, Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment, saying: [...] "It's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back. And I think that's really important, especially for girls, {{because so many people}} are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, <b>teachers</b> <b>say</b> this.'" [...] Upon the making of the song, Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound, explaining: [...] "I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song". She elaborated: [...] "So you think that must be kind of a sad ballad, but it's a party song. ... It's about breaking free." ...|$|E

Some of their <b>teachers</b> <b>say,</b> that if you're struck on the cheek, it's a duty to turn {{the other side of}} the face, and take another blow, instead of seeking revenge, whereby I understand--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Do not {{regret the}} display of {{considerable}} self-will {{on the part of}} your children. It is the correlative of that diminished coerciveness so conspicuous in modern education. The greater tendency to assert freedom of action on the one side, corresponds to the smaller tendency to tyrannise on the other. They both indicate an approach to the system of discipline we contend for, under which children will be more and more led to rule themselves by the experience of natural consequences; and they are both accompaniments of our more advanced social state. The independent English boy is the father of the independent English man; and you cannot have the last without the first. German <b>teachers</b> <b>say</b> that they had rather manage a dozen German boys than one English one. Shall we, therefore, wish that our boys had the manageableness of German ones, and with it the submissiveness and political serfdom of adult Germans? Or shall we not rather tolerate in our boys those feelings which make them free men, and modify our methods accordingly? ...|$|E

[...] "That's {{what the}} {{question}} comes to, and I'll tell you frankly, since, until we or our children {{bring in the}} new era, it's all that the man has to expect who believes this world can {{and ought to be}} made better. I've been ridden over by U. S. cavalry, and beaten by patrolmen's clubs. I've been hounded out of cities where I lawfully earned my bread, and sand-bagged by hired toughs. That would be a little thing if I were the only victim, but you know--you can read it in your papers almost any day--what happens to the men who have the grit to work as well as to hope for the dawn of better days for down-trodden humanity. You're to wait for it--on the other side of Jordan--your <b>teachers</b> <b>say.</b> Boys, we want it here and now, and it's coming, a little nearer every day. You have got to believe that, and when the outlook grows black get a tighter clinch upon your faith. Was it a shadow and a fancy that the men died for who went down in every struggle for the last ten years?--we needn't go back farther. Right across this prosperous continent you'll find their graves--men shot and sabred, strung to bridges and telegraph poles. Boys, we've been waiting--waiting a long while----" ...|$|E

50|$|The pilgrim, or the haji, is honoured in the Muslim community. Islamic <b>teachers</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} Hajj {{should be an}} {{expression}} of devotion to God, not a means to gain social standing. The believer should be self-aware and examine their intentions in performing the pilgrimage. This should lead to constant striving for self-improvement. A pilgrimage made at any time other than the Hajj season is called an Umrah, and while not mandatory is strongly recommended. Also, they make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Jerusalem in their alms-giving feast.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>teachers</b> <b>say</b> {{that only}} God can forgive one's sins, some see Exodus [...] and Isaiah [...] and [...] {{as proof of}} this claim. Mark thus leaves it implied that Jesus is God and that faith in his power can lead to not just a cure of {{physical}} ills but to a forgiveness of a person's sins. However, this statement must be balanced with St Paul's acceptance of his [...] "thorn in the flesh". This {{makes it clear that}} faith does not automatically result in bodily healing (as opposed to spiritual healing).Early Christians may have used this story to buttress their claims of Jesus' ability to forgive sins. Thus to the teachers Jesus claim is blasphemy as they do not think Jesus is God, but to Mark's audience this confirms their belief in Jesus' divinity.|$|E
50|$|For this reason, Buddhist <b>teachers</b> <b>say</b> that one's present {{condition}} {{as a human}} should be valued very highly, and not allowed to slide by, as the combination of existence as a human {{and the presence of}} a Buddha's teaching may not come again for a very long time. Any human, in this view, who finds himself or herself in a position to learn the Dharma, would be remiss if he or she did not take advantage of it. This view also stands in contrast to those who would claim that, if one is to be reborn multiple times, {{there is no need to}} worry about one's actions in this life as they can always be amended in the future; rather, there is no assurance that in a long series of lives one will ever obtain the right circumstances for enlightenment, so it is important to seize the day.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2015, it was {{reported}} that a Dutch school no longer taught about the Holocaust due to the large number of Muslim students who refused to be taught about the subject. At a roundtable discussion with teachers and other educators that was held by the ChristianUnion party, Arie Slob, the party’s parliamentary leader, stated that Holocaust survivors are no longer asked to speak at many Dutch schools, while adding that [...] "I am horrified by this. It is unacceptable that 70 years after the Holocaust, anti-Semitism in the Netherlands is growing." [...] Wissam Feriani, a social studies teacher (who is himself a Muslim), recounted his experiences: [...] "The <b>teacher</b> <b>says</b> Jews, the pupils <b>say</b> Gaza.

30|$|I see {{differences}} {{in teaching and}} learning between the two curricula. Within the current teaching methods applied in our conventional curriculum, what the <b>teacher</b> <b>says</b> can be “Silent!”, “Quiet!”, “Don’t speak freely!” But with teaching and learning according to this curriculum, students are very free to pose ideas.

There can also be warranted assertions about what is said about teachers and students, i.e. verified statements about statements about the educational process. Warranted assertions about the educational process are educology. Warranted assertions about statements about the educational process are meta-educology.

In contrast, the statement, The statement, [...] "Compulsory school is a requirement which all contemporary nations have stipulated in law," [...] requires verification by examining the statutes of every nation is an example of meta-educology.

5000|$|Finland has {{had access}} to free {{universal}} daycare for children aged eight months {{to five years in}} place since 1990, and a year of [...] "preschool/kindergarten" [...] at age six, since 1996. [...] "Daycare" [...] includes both full-day childcare centers and municipal playgrounds with adult supervision where parents can accompany the child. Municipalities also pay mothers who wish to do so to remain at home and provide [...] "home daycare" [...] for the first three years. In some cases this includes occasional visits from a careworker to see that the environment is appropriate. The ratio of adults to children in local municipal childcare centers (either private but subsidized by local municipalities or paid for by municipalities with the help of grants from the central government) is, for children three years old and under: three adults (one teacher and two nurses) for every 12 pupils (or one-to-four); and, for children age three to six: three adults (one teacher and two nurses) for every 20 children (or circa one-to-seven). Payment, where applicable, is scaled to family income and ranges from free to about 200 euros a month maximum. According to Pepa Ódena in these centers, [...] "You are not taught, you learn. The children learn through playing. This philosophy is put into practice in all the schools we visited, in what the <b>teachers</b> <b>say,</b> and in all that one sees." ...|$|E
