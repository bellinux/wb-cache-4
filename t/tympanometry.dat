50|$|<b>Tympanometry</b> is a {{valuable}} component of the audiometric evaluation. In evaluating hearing loss, <b>tympanometry</b> permits a distinction between sensorineural and conductive hearing loss, when evaluation is not apparent via Weber and Rinne testing. Furthermore, in a primary care setting, <b>tympanometry</b> {{can be helpful in}} making the diagnosis of otitis media by demonstrating the presence of a middle ear effusion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tympanometry</b> {{measures}} the peak pressure (TPP) and peak-compensated static admittance (Ytm) {{of the middle}} ear at the eardrum. As the stapes is ankylosed in otosclerosis, the lateral end of the ossicular chain may still be quite mobile. Therefore, otosclerosis may only slightly reduce the admittance, resulting in either a shallow tympanogram (type AS), or a normal tympanogram (type A). Otosclerosis increases in the stiffness of the middle-ear system, raising its resonant frequency. This can be quantified using multi-frequency <b>tympanometry.</b> Thus, a high resonant-frequency pathology such as otosclerosis can be differentiated from low resonant-frequency pathologies such as ossicular discontinuity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tympanometry</b> is an {{examination}} {{used to test}} the condition of the middle ear and mobility of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) and the conduction bones by creating variations of air pressure in the ear canal.|$|E
50|$|Identification of {{sensorineural hearing}} loss is usually made by {{performing}} a pure tone audiometry (an audiogram) in which bone conduction thresholds are measured. <b>Tympanometry</b> and speech audiometry may be helpful. Testing is performed by an audiologist.|$|E
5000|$|Acoustic {{immittance}} audiometry - Immittance audiometry is {{an objective}} technique which evaluates middle ear function by three procedures: static immittance, <b>tympanometry,</b> and {{the measurement of}} acoustic reflex threshold sensitivity. Immittance audiometry is superior to pure tone audiometry in detecting middle ear pathology.|$|E
50|$|Most of the time, the stapedius reflex {{is tested}} with <b>tympanometry.</b> The {{contraction}} of the stapedius muscle stiffens the middle-ear, thus decreasing middle-ear admittance; {{this can be}} measured thanks to tympanometry.The acoustic stapedius reflex can also be recorded by means of extratympanic manometry (ETM).|$|E
50|$|Patulous Eustachian tube is {{frequently}} misdiagnosed as standard congestion {{due to the}} similarity in symptoms and rarity of the disorder. Audiologists {{are more likely to}} recognize the disorder, usually with <b>tympanometry</b> or nasally delivered masking noise during a hearing assessment, which is highly sensitive to this condition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tympanometry</b> is an {{objective}} test of middle-ear function. It {{is not a}} hearing test, but rather a measure of energy transmission through the middle ear. The test {{should not be used}} to assess the sensitivity of hearing and the results of this test should always be viewed in conjunction with pure tone audiometry.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{convenient to use}} immittance {{to refer to a}} complex number which may be either the impedance (ratio of voltage to current in electrical circuits, or sound pressure to volume velocity in acoustical systems) or the admittance (ratio of current to voltage, or volume velocity to sound pressure) of a system. In audiology, <b>tympanometry</b> {{is sometimes}} called immittance testing.|$|E
50|$|If lesions are typical, non-extensive {{and with}} no {{detriment}} to hearing, investigation into the condition is rarely required. Audiometry is {{used to determine the}} extent of hearing loss, if any. <b>Tympanometry</b> produces tympanograms which can be different when tympanosclerosis is present. Computerised tomography (CT) can be used to determine if disease is present in the middle ear. Whilst hearing loss is a common symptom in many diseases of the ear, for example in otosclerosis (abnormal bone growth in the ear), the white, chalky patches on the tympanic membrane are fairly characteristic of tympanosclerosis. Cholesteatoma is similar in appearance but the whiteness is behind the tympanic membrane, rather than inside.|$|E
5000|$|When {{determining}} the best protocol for school-based screenings, {{it is important}} to note the limitations of both equipment and potential screening staff. For example, the screening staff may not have the skills in otoscopy, or ear examination, to identify ear pathology as such, other than through gross visual examination for disorders such as pinna abnormalities, discharge, or impacted wax (McPherson & Olusanya, 2008). [...] Gell et al., (1992) advises against the use of <b>tympanometry</b> in screening for developing countries where the prevalence of otitis media is high since [...] "(a) ear discharge can be better noted through visual inspection of the ear, and (b) identification of moderate to severe hearing loss is a priority" [...] (McPherson & Olusanya, 2008).|$|E
40|$|In recent years, <b>tympanometry</b> {{has been}} used to provide {{objective}} and definitive information regarding the status of middle ear conditions and functions. The present standard for tympanometric normalcy is based upon between-subject measures. This standard, however, does not allow precise differentiation between normal and pathological <b>tympanometry</b> curves. A within-subject comparison of right and left ear <b>tympanometry</b> curves of normal-hearing subjects could provide a narrow standard of tympanometric normalcy which would be more useful in differentiating between pathologic and non-pathologic middle ear function. The within-subject relationship between <b>tympanometry</b> curves for right and left ears was investigated by comparing the individual right and left ear <b>tympanometry</b> curves at 220 and 660 Hz of 30 normal-hearing young adults. This was done to determine if a difference exists between within-subject right and left ear <b>tympanometry</b> curves. Three characteristics, curve peak amplitude, curve width, and pressure at curve peak, were measured and compared for each <b>tympanometry</b> curve. All <b>tympanometry</b> was conducted with a Grason-Stadler Otoadmittance Meter (Model 1720) utilizing a combined mode of conductance and susceptance. All <b>tympanometry</b> curves were graphically recorded on a Hewlitt-Packard X-Y plotter (Model 7035 B). Statistical analysis and graphic illustration showed that for practical purposes no significant clinical difference exists between within-subject right and left ear <b>tympanometry</b> curves and that measurement variability is predominantly due to between-subject differences. The ranges of between-ear differences were much reduced in comparison to the computed ranges for between-subject measures. These findings would suggest that a definition of tympanometric normalcy should be based not only upon between-subject measures, but also upon between-ear comparison...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tympanometry</b> {{is useful}} for {{evaluating}} middle ear (ME) status, but its accuracy in estimating true ME pressure has been ques-tioned. We evaluated the accuracy of <b>tympanometry</b> in 6 monkeys. Direct application and measurement of ME pressure were achieved with a probe introduced into the mastoid antrum, and <b>tympanometry</b> was done over a large range of applied ME pressures. For all ears, tympanometric pressure was a linear function of applied pressure. At large overpressures, the tympanometric pressure was approximately 40 mm H 20 greater than the applied pressure, {{but there was little}} error in the measurement for applied underpressures. The measurement error was proportional to the ME pressure multiplied by the ratio of the extant volume displacement of the tym-panic membrane to ME volume.

40|$|A {{winner of}} the Biological Award for this poster project {{completed}} at the Wichita State University Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Presented at the 10 th Annual Capitol Graduate Research Summit, Topeka, KS, February 14, 2013. The middle ear transforms airborne sounds into mechanical vibration and helps improve sound transmission into the fluid-filled inner ear. This is an imperfect process. Part of the sound energy is reflected back to the ear canal due to acoustic impedance mismatch. A new technique—wideband energy reflectance (ER), has been developed to evaluate the middle-ear function. It determines the proportion of reflected energy and gives information for a broad frequency range, an advantage over the conventional single-frequency <b>tympanometry</b> in audiology. ER can be measured at the ambient pressure (aER) and expressed in energy absorbance (EA = 1 –ER). Wideband <b>tympanometry</b> has been introduced to measure EA with the air pressure varied in the ear canal. Previous studies observed that repeated testing of low-frequency <b>tympanometry</b> altered outcomes. The object {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of repetitive measurements of wideband <b>tympanometry</b> on EA. Seventeen adults with normal hearing and middle-ear function were recruited. Eight wideband <b>tympanometry</b> tests were consecutively performed in between two aER tests. Data revealed that successive testing of wideband <b>tympanometry</b> resulted in a frequency-specific change of EA. The EA increased below 1. 5 kHz, deceased from 1. 5 to 3 kHz, and decreased again at 5 to 6 kHz. This study has shown, for the first time, a statistically significant effect of repeated <b>tympanometry</b> on EA. Results suggest that this effect should be taken into account, or be minimized, to increase validity when repetitive wideband <b>tympanometry</b> is required in applications, for instance, in test-retest reliability studies...|$|E

All subjects underwent pneumatic otoscopy, standard pure-tone audiometry, <b>tympanometry,</b> and transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions. Results. In the group of children with bilateral otitis media, transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions were absent in 51 ears (67 %). In the remaining 25 ears (33 %) the mean emission amplitude was reduced, as compared to the mean value of the control group. Conclusions. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions should be included in the diagnostic workup of otitis media with effusion because it is a fast, reliable, and objective test. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions should always be used in conjunction with <b>tympanometry,</b> because a more meaningful interpretation of transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions measures is possible...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} further examine the {{relationship}} between <b>tympanometry</b> and mortality after noting an unexpected association on assessment of baseline data of a study whose primary aim was to investigate the utility of noninvasive tympanic membrane displacement measurement for monitoring intracranial pressure in childhood coma. METHODS: We recruited children who presented with acute nontraumatic coma to the high-dependency unit of Kilifi District Hospital on the rural coast of Kenya. We excluded children with sickle cell disease, epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental delay. We performed <b>tympanometry</b> on the right ear before tympanic membrane displacement analyzer measurements. All children were managed according to standard World Health Organization guidelines. RESULTS: We recruited 72 children with a median age of 3. 2 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2. 0 - 4. 3 years); 31 (43 %) were female. Thirty-eight (53 %) had cerebral malaria, 8 (11 %) acute bacterial meningitis, 4 (6 %) sepsis, and 22 (30 %) encephalopathy of unknown etiology. Twenty (28 %) children died. <b>Tympanometry</b> was normal in 25 (35 %) children. Adjusting for diagnosis and clinical features of increased intracranial pressure, both associated with death on univariable analysis, children with abnormal <b>tympanometry</b> had greater odds of dying than did those with normal <b>tympanometry</b> (adjusted odds ratio: 17. 0; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 9 - 152. 4; P =. 01).

40|$|Otitis {{media is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of effusion in the middle ear. It {{is one of the most}} common ear diseases in adults and it needs to be early diagnozed and treated, because of its possible adverse effects in middle ear function. Diagnosis of otitis media is based on history, otoscopy and conventional <b>tympanometry.</b> The later, although very popular, does not always identify the presence of middle ear effusion, which is thought to be almost certain in cases of type B tympanograms, whereas it can be quite reliably excluded in cases of type A tympanograms. However, in cases of transitional tympanograms (type As and C), any tympanometry-based predictions seem to be rather uncertain. On the other hand, Multiple Frequency <b>Tympanometry</b> is an extension of coventional <b>tympanometry,</b> which theoritically may provide more precise assessment of middle ear status. However, its clinical importance in the evaluation of otitis media remains to be explored. The aim of this study was: n to investigate the way that middle ear acts in adults, both under physiological conditions and under the presence of otitis media with effusion n to compare between the findings of simple <b>tympanometry</b> at 226 Hz and <b>tympanometry</b> at higher frequencies (678, 1000 ΠZ) and multiple <b>tympanometry</b> n to investigate the prognostic value of Multiple Frequency <b>Tympanometry</b> in diagnosis and prognosis of otitis media with effusion in adults. In the present study participated 165 adults (165 ears), divided in two groups: first group consisted of 83 normal hearing adults (83 ears) and served as control group, and second group consisted of 82 adults (82 ears) with otitis media with effusion. All subjects underwent both Conventional <b>Tympanometry</b> and Multiple Frequency <b>Tympanometry</b> measurements. All impedance measurements were performed by using Grason Stadle Middle Ear Analyzer GSI- 33, version 2 and resulted to the following: 1) All ears with middle ear effusion in the myringotomy showed statistically significant lower absolute values, compared to the ears of the control group. (Values are resonance frequency (RF), phase angle ??, gradient of simple tympanogram at 226 Hz and tympanometric height of tympanogram at RF) 2) Type B simple tympanogram represent the standard tympanometric expression of otitis media with effusion, whereas type C simple tympanogram resemble to normal ones and type As simple tympanogram shows intermediate behaviour between the type B and C tympanograms. 3) Presence of middle ear effusion in ears with transitional simple tympanograms (type C and As) ranged between 50 % and 71, 4 %. 4) Underlying middle ear pathology seems to be highly related to the morphology of tympanograms recorded at resonance frequency (RF). In a percentage more than 95 %, flat RF tympanograms derived from ears with effusion, whereas notched RF tympanograms derived from ears without effusion in a percentage more than 73 %. 5) Using Multiple Frequency <b>Tympanometry</b> we studied the morphology of simple tymanograms type B for the Admittance (Y), the Susceptance (B) and the Conductance (G) as the frequency is getting higher from 226 Hz to 678 Hz and to 1000 Hz. The result for the three parameters is that for all of them, their tympanograms tend to present notch as the frequency is getting higher. 6) Discriminal Statistical Analysis resulted to a specific arithmetic relation between resonance frequency (RF) and phase angle (??) values, with a cut-off point of - 0. 65, which enabled us, with high accuracy, to predict the presence of effusion in pathological ears (83 % versus 67 % of simple <b>tympanometry).</b> In conclusion, Multiple Frequency <b>Tympanometry</b> (MFT) seems promising for the diagnosis and investigation of several middle ear disorders. According to our results, MFT appears to evaluate quite accurately the presence of middle ear effusion. Therefore, we suggest the use of MFT in the evaluation of otitis media with effusion in adults, enriching the clinician’s diagnostic options, without replacing or underestimating the traditional methods and especially clinical examination, that has always been irreplaceable. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the test performance of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) when used as a screening tool in the school setting.

Optimal DPOAE test performance was determined in comparison with pure-tone screening results using clinical decision analysis. The results showed hit rates of 0. 86, 0. 89, and 0. 90, and false alarm rates of 0. 52, 0. 19, and 0. 22 for criterion signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of 4, 5, and 11 dB at 1. 1, 1. 9, and 3. 8 kHz respectively.

Objective: To {{investigate}} the effect of consecutive 1000 -Hz <b>tympanometry</b> testing on admittance measures, and examine test-retest reliability. Design: Repeated measures with eight trials of 1000 -Hz Y-a and B-a/G(a) <b>tympanometry,</b> respectively, in two ears of each subject, followed by repeated 226 -Hz <b>tympanometry.</b> Study sample: Twenty-seven normal-hearing young adults. Results: For single-peak tympanograms, peak Y-tm and G(tm) systematically increased across trials with a mean change of 8 % and 15 % at Trial 8, respectively, whereas B-tm increased marginally. For notched tympanograms, peak Y-tm and B-tm decreased by 23 % and 162 % at Trial 8, and G(tm) in two cases also decreased (10 % on average). Trial 2 and 3 contributed 50 % to 70 % of the total changes. Test-retest differences of subsequently acquired 1000 - and 226 -Hz tympanograms were smaller than previously reported.

The aim {{of this study was to}} com-pare the long-term high-frequency <b>tympanometry</b> and audiometry outcomes of tympanoplasty using cartilage and fascia. Methods: Forty patients in whom tragal cartilage was used in type 1 tympanoplasty and 40 patients in whom temporal muscle fascia was used were included in the study. The preoperative and postoperative audiometries of the two groups were compared. Postoperative high-frequency <b>tympanometry</b> (224, 668, 800, and 1000 Hz) and air volume, compliance, and pressure differences of the two groups were also compared...|$|E
40|$|Hearing {{status was}} studied in 22 {{subjects}} (10 adults and 12 children) with confirmed congenital blood coagulation disorder. Each subject {{was assessed using}} an extensive audiological test battery. For the adult subjects this included pure-tone audiometry, <b>tympanometry</b> and acoustic reflex measures, speech audiometry, staggered spondaic word test, synthetic sentence identification test and masking level difference test. The children 2 ̆ 7 s tests included pure-tone audiometry, <b>tympanometry,</b> acoustic reflex measures and paediatric speech intelligibility testing. Test results were compared to normative data. An increased prevalence in adults of both sensorineural hearing loss above 4000 Hz and possible central auditory dysfunction localised in the higher brain stem or cortical structures were the main findings of the research...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tympanometry</b> {{was used}} to provide {{evidence}} of middle ear effusions in a prospective study of middle ear disease in 264 children aged 3 months to 6 years in general practice. Adequate measurements on both ears were obtained in 220 children, of whom 68 (31 %) had evidence of middle ear effusion in one ear (29 children) or both ears (39 children) at entry to the study. In 28 (42 %) of the 68 children persistence of the tympanometric findings was recorded {{for at least three}} months. Children of European descent {{were more likely to have}} evidence of middle ear effusion at the initial examination compared with African and West Indian children, as were those children whose siblings had a positive history of otitis media compared with those whose siblings had no such history. Children under 3 years were more likely to have evidence of an effusion than older children. Middle ear effusion as shown by <b>tympanometry</b> was not associated with a previous history of otitis media in the child but was associated with recent symptoms of respiratory infection or otalgia. A previous consultation for otitis media was, however, strongly associated with a greater likelihood of a consultation for otitis media during the follow up period. Comparing evidence of effusion by <b>tympanometry</b> with that by pneumatic otoscopy showed that using the appearance of the eardrum alone the sensitivity of otoscopy was 55 %; the addition of mobility improved the sensitivity to 76 % with little reduction in specificity. Further studies on populations using <b>tympanometry</b> are needed to determine the natural history, aetiology, and indications for referring children with middle ear effusion...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{establish}} {{test performance}} measures for Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission testing of 6 -year-old {{children in a}} school setting; (2) To investigate whether Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission testing provides a more accurate and effective alternative to a pure tone screening plus <b>tympanometry</b> protocol. Methods: Pure tone screening, <b>tympanometry</b> and transient evoked otoacoustic emission {{data were collected from}} 940 subjects (1880 ears), {{with a mean age of}} 6. 2 years. Subjects were tested in non-sound-treated rooms within 22 schools. Receiver operating characteristics curves along with specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and efficiency values were determined for a variety of transient evoked otoacoustic emission/pure tone screening/tympanometry comparisons. Results: The Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission failure rate for the group was 20. 3 %. The failure rate for pure tone screening was found to be 8. 9 %, whilst 18. 6 % of subjects failed a protocol consisting of combined pure tone screening and <b>tympanometry</b> results. In essence, findings from the comparison of overall Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission pass/fail with overall pure tone screening pass/fail suggested that use of a modified Rhode Island Hearing Assessment Project criterion would result in a very high probability that a child with a pass result has normal hearing (true negative). However, the hit rate was only moderate. Selection of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criterion set at ≥ 1 dB appeared to provide the best test performance measures for the range of SNR values investigated. Test performance measures generally declined when <b>tympanometry</b> results were included, with the exception of lower false alarm rates and higher positive predictive values. The exclusion of low frequency data from the Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission SNR versus pure tone screening analysis resulted in improved performance measures. Conclusions: The present study poses several implications for the clinical implementation of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission screening for entry level school children. Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission pass/fail criteria will require revision. The findings of the current investigation offer support to the possible replacement of pure tone screening with Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission testing for 6 -year-old children. However, they do not suggest the replacement of the pure tone screening plus <b>tympanometry</b> battery. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
