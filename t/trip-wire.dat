50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of any wire obstacle is greatly increased by planting anti-tank and blast antipersonnel mines {{in and around}} it. Additionally, connecting bounding anti-personnel mines (e.g. the PROM-1) to the obstacle with tripwires {{has the effect of}} booby-trapping the obstacle itself, hindering attempts to clear it. Dummy tripwires can be added to cause further confusion. If anti-personnel mines are unavailable, it is very easy to connect hand-grenades to the wire using <b>trip-wires.</b> If the use of lethal explosive devices is deemed to be unsuitable, it is easy to emplace tripflares in and around the wire obstacle in order to make night-time infiltration harder.|$|R

A number of devices with such fuzes were planted in bunkers but most booby-traps had simple pressure detonators. Wires were attached to useful items like stove chimneys and loot; <b>trip-wires</b> on the stairs of dugouts were connected to bundles of hand-grenades. On some roads, heavy-artillery shells were buried with contact-fuzes, which would only be triggered {{by the weight of}} a lorry. British engineers and tunnelling companies scoured areas as they were occupied and disabled many of the explosives. Roads were flooded by destroying drains and water-courses; wells sabotaged by drilling a shaft next to them and exploding a charge, permanently ruining the well. Much of the explosive used by the Germans (Donarit, Westphalite and Perdit) had the property of water-absorption so could be neutralised by dousing. Some British booby-trap patrols made German prisoners go first, who revealed traps rather than be blown up and British tunnellers removed [...] of explosives.

He {{was part of a}} reconnaissance mission near Sangin in Helmand Province in Afghanistan on 9 February 2008. Moving through a compound at night he felt a <b>trip-wire</b> against his leg and saw that he had activated a grenade. He threw himself to the ground, and used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor, and tucked his legs up to his body. He was thrown some distance by the explosion, but due to the protection offered by his rucksack and body-armour, suffered only a nose-bleed, perforated ear drums and some disorientation. The pack was ripped from his back by the explosion, and his body armour and helmet were pitted by grenade fragments. Of the other three members of his patrol, the rear man managed to take cover by retreating round the corner of a building; the patrol commander threw himself to ground, and received a superficial face wound from a grenade fragment; and the final team member did not have time to react, and remained on his feet, and would have been within the lethal range of the grenade but for Croucher's action. The explosion breached a large lithium battery which was in Croucher's pack to power the patrol's electronic countermeasures equipment, causing it to burst into flames. A medic recommended that he be evacuated, but he insisted on continuing as the members of the patrol realised that Taliban fighters would probably come to investigate the explosion, and this would give the marines the opportunity to ambush them.|$|E
40|$|Marginal Employment is a <b>trip-wire</b> We analyse the {{consequences}} of starting {{a certain type of}} low-wage job, “marginal employment”, for unemployed workers. In particular, we ask ourselves whether the un-employed who work few hours—without losing their UI entitlement—face better labour market outcomes than those who do not work while collecting UI benefits. A priori it is not clear if those who work in marginal employment improve their labour market sta-tus, e. g. by signalling effort, or worsen it by a reduced job search effort. We selected unemployed workers and investigate the effect of marginal employment on their labour market outcomes, by means of propensity score matching. Our results suggest that selec-tion into marginal employment is “negative”, i. e. workers with characteristics we usually associate with low-productivity are more likely to select into such jobs. The unemployed who started to work in marginal employment during their unemployment spell suffered a (causal) penalty for doing so, relative to their peers who did not. The penalty, in terms of less employment, more unemployment, lower wages, lessens over time. Marginal employ-ment is thus neither a stepping stone, nor a dead-end, it is more like a <b>trip-wire,</b> causing the unemployed who start ME to stumble and, consequently, to lag behind their peers...|$|E

40|$|Memory-safety {{violations}} are a prevalent {{cause of}} both reliability and security vulnerabilities in systems software written in unsafe languages like C/C++. Unfortunately, all the existing software-based solutions {{to this problem}} exhibit high performance overheads preventing them from wide adoption in production runs. To address this issue, Intel recently released a new ISA extension - Memory Protection Extensions (Intel MPX), a hardware-assisted full-stack solution to protect against memory safety violations. In this work, we perform an exhaustive study of the Intel MPX architecture to understand its advantages and caveats. We base our study along three dimensions: (a) performance overheads, (b) security guarantees, and (c) usability issues. To put our results in perspective, we compare Intel MPX with three prominent software-based approaches: (1) <b>trip-wire</b> - AddressSanitizer, (2) object-based - SAFECode, and (3) pointer-based - SoftBound. Our main conclusion is that Intel MPX is a promising technique that is not yet practical for widespread adoption. Intel MPX's performance overheads are still high (roughly 50 % on average), and the supporting infrastructure has bugs which may cause compilation or runtime errors. Moreover, we showcase the design limitations of Intel MPX: it cannot detect temporal errors, may have false positives and false negatives in multithreaded code, and its restrictions on memory layout require substantial code changes for some programs...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Urban freeways are the backbone of the highway transportation system and the demand on this system is growing. The increase in demand creates an increase in traffic congestion. Past construction solutions to relieve congestion are less viable today due to rising costs and government regulations. Effectively managing the operations of the existing highway transportation network is an alternative for congestion mitigation. The research documented in this study analyzes a <b>trip-wire</b> video image processing system's ability and limitations in accurately detecting passenger cars with and without passenger cars traveling in the adjacent travel lane. This study also analvzes a video image processing system's ability to determine passenger car speeds. Testing was performed at Texas A&M University's Riverside Campus research facility. Testing analyzed three camera heights, 30 feet, 40 feet and 49 feet- 6 inches, in conjunction with three passenger car speeds, 20 mph, 45 mph and 55 mph. The video image processing system used in the study was the Autoscop 0 m 2004 by Image Sensing Systems, Inc. The camera imaging device was a one-half (1 / 2) inch interline transfer microlens charged coupled device (CCD). The camera lens was a six (6) mm, fl. 2 auto ifis lens. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test indicated both camera height and travel lane location affected the system's ability to accurately detect passenger cars. Generally, higher camera heights and travel lanes farther from the camera produced accurate passenger car detection farther upstream from the camera. Also, it was determined that passenger cars traveling in adjacent travel lanes did not significantly influence the video image processing system's ability to accurately detect passenger cars. The paired t-test indicated that passenger car speeds determined by the video image processing system were significantly different when compared to passenger car speeds obtained by a radar speed gun. The results of this thesis research study provide some guidance on the use and placement of a video image processing system in a freeway application. This study also provides some recommendations regarding future video image processing system research and development...|$|E
