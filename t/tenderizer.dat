Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat stains on clothes, and enzymes in meat <b>tenderizer</b> break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.|$|E
25|$|Bromelain is {{an enzyme}} extract {{derived from the}} stems of pineapples, {{although}} it exists {{in all parts of}} the fresh plant and fruit. The extract has a history of folk medicine use. As a culinary ingredient, it may be used as a meat <b>tenderizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Raw kiwifruit {{contains}} actinidain (also spelled actinidin) {{which is}} commercially {{useful as a}} meat <b>tenderizer</b> and possibly as a digestive aid. Actinidain also makes raw kiwifruit unsuitable for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products because the enzyme digests milk proteins. This applies to gelatin-based desserts, as well, as the actinidain will dissolve the proteins in gelatin, either liquefying the dessert or preventing it from solidifying.|$|E

25|$|Salt {{is added}} to food, either by the food {{producer}} or by the consumer, as a flavor enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation-control additive, texture-control agent and color developer. The salt consumption in the food industry is subdivided, in descending order of consumption, into other food processing, meat packers, canning, baking, dairy and grain mill products. Salt {{is added to}} promote color development in bacon, ham and other processed meat products. As a preservative, salt inhibits the growth of bacteria. Salt acts as a binder in sausages to form a binding gel made up of meat, fat, and moisture. Salt also acts as a flavor enhancer and as a <b>tenderizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In many dairy industries, salt {{is added}} to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and <b>tenderizer.</b> In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, cat and dog food.|$|E
25|$|Russian food {{historian}} William Pokhlyobkin {{claimed that}} chicken Kiev {{was invented in}} 1912 as Novo-Mikhailovskaya kotleta in а St. Petersburg Merchants' Club located near the Mikhailovsky palace, and was renamed kotleta po-kiyevski in 1947 by a Soviet restaurant. However, these claims collide with primary sources. The cookbook by Alexandrova-Ignatieva (including editions before and after 1912) describes indeed Novo-Mikhailovsky cutlets and mentions that they were invented in the club near the Mikhailovsky palace. However, in the provided recipe these cutlets are made from minced meat similarly to the Pozharsky cutlet, with the only difference being the meat pounded by a <b>tenderizer</b> until it gets minced. This allows one to remove tendons from the meat and results in a more tender consistency of the ground meat than after {{the use of a}} grinder. The author also remarks that not only breasts but also other parts of chicken can be prepared this way and added to the mixture of meat and butter.|$|E

50|$|Historical {{treatment}} of food bolus obstruction included administration of proteolytic enzymes (such as meat <b>tenderizers)</b> {{with the purpose}} of degrading the meat that was blocked; however, it is possible that these methods may increase the risk of perforation of the esophagus. Other modalities rarely used now include removal of boluses using catheters, and the use of large-bore tubes inserted into the esophagus to forcefully lavage it.|$|R
50|$|Certain proteases {{can have}} insecticidal effects. This process works through using {{naturally}} occurring enzymes {{similar to those}} within the insects themselves. These proteolytic enzymes cause the insect to hatch and molt prematurely, destroying the creature's exoskeleton. These enzymes {{are similar to those}} found in meat <b>tenderizers</b> and digestive aids. The benefits of this type of treatment is that the lice do not develop resistance and these products are less toxic.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the physico-chemical properties of chicken gizzard and goat heart treated with kachri (Cucumis trigonus Roxb.) and ginger (Zingiber officinale roscoe) as natural <b>tenderizers.</b> Both the byproducts were marinated at 4 ± 2 °C for 48 h with 10 % (w/w) paste of natural <b>tenderizers</b> alone and in combination (ginger+kachri, 75 : 25) followed with cooking in boiling water. Chicken gizzard had significantly higher shear press value, Water Holding Capacity (WHC), cooking loss, moisture and protein content and significantly lower fat content than goat heart in control as well as treatments. Moisture content and shear press value significantly reduced and protein, fat, ash content and pH increased on cooking, in both the byproducts. Kachri paste lowered the pH and Water Holding Capacity (WHC) but combination of ginger with kachri was effective in improving the pH and WHC up {{to the level of}} control. Combination of ginger+kachri treatment increased the cooking loss but reduced the shear press value in both the byproducts significantly for further utilization of these byproducts...|$|R

40|$|Studies on meat aging have {{comprehensively}} been reviewedl- 3) {{during the}} past years. The common belief is that the aging has profound effect on myofibrils. Many past studies were concerned with the interaction of actin and myosin {{in the region of}} thick and thin filament overlap. The consensus is that if rigor linkages between these two sets of protein were weakened, meat would become more tender 4 - 5). But, an alternative view has also been postulated which suggests that the aging is due to disintegration of the Z lines of sarcomeres leading to the loss in tensile strength of myo-fibrils and to increased tenderness in cooked meat 7 - 8). Despite these inten-sive studies any direct correlation between structural and tenderness changes is still very much a mystery.
