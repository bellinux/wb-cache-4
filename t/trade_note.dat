40|$|The World Bank {{released}} a staff <b>trade</b> <b>note</b> on 'Export Subsidies: Agricultural Reform and Developing Countries' on September 10 th 2003, reviewing the WTO experience in disciplining export subsidies both overt and hidden. It notes that while Uruguay Round commitments on reducing export subsidies were met, this {{was largely a}} result of the base periods chosen, which made the targets 'unusually easy to achieve'. It outlines the various ways governments circumvented subsidy limits while meeting their nominal commitments, and notes that there was weaker discipline on the less transparent forms of export support, highlighting this as a key area in the new round. It describes how the various forms of less transparent forms of export support (food aid, export credits, state trading enterprises) work. The paper makes a number of recommendations for further disciplining export support including: establishing a firm deadline for the elimination of export subsidies; the introduction of significant reductions in MFN tariffs, since this will automatically strengthen disciplines in export subsidies; the introduction of ad valorem limits on the per unit subsidy on a commodity-by-commodity basis; the banning of 'rolling over' of the agreed limits; close monitoring of export subsidies; the establishment of all commitments on a per product basis; the closing of loopholes; the extension of disciplines on export subsidies to other forms of export support. Comment: The paper provides a useful review of the export subsidies debates. It should be borne in mind however that it refers to all developing countries, and export support from all major OECD countries and not simply ACP-EU trade issues arising from the deployment of export subsidies. Thus it neglects the important role that export subsidies can play in supplying cheap raw materials to value-added processing industries in ACP countries which lack an adequate raw materials base.

They reflect solely {{the views of}} the author, and do not necessarily reflect {{the views of the}} World Bank Group or its Executive Directors, or the countries they represent. <b>Trade</b> <b>Note</b> 23 Almost two-thirds of the economic gains that would come from dismantling all merchandise trade barriers and farm subsidies globally would come from agriculture. According to our latest research 1, this is so for the world as a whole, and also for developing countries as a group. Developing countries are therefore right to focus on agriculture in the negotiations. To date that focus has been almost exclusively on developed country policies. That is understandable, given that many in developing countries feel they did not get a good deal out of the Uruguay Round and so are determined to get significantly more commitments under Doha from developed countries before they contemplate opening their own markets further. However, our modeling suggests that over half the gains to developing countries from global agricultural reforms would come from liberalization by developing countries themselves (Table 1). The reason is two-fold: because agricultural tariffs are even Table 1 : Effects on developing country economic welfare of full trade liberalization from different groups of countries and products, 2015 (percent) From full liberalization of...|$|E
30|$|The main {{conclusions}} of the existing literature focusing on international <b>trade</b> <b>note</b> that the technological innovation effect of trade can simultaneously influence both importers and exporters. International trade can either improve the technological level of the production activities in the importing country through high-quality intermediate products (Tradee and Helpman, 1993; Grossman and Helpman, 1991), or improve the technological level of the exporting country by means of Original Equipment Manufacturer as well as processing trade. Some studies argue that the positive impact of foreign trade on technological innovation is confined to developed countries (Coe and Helpman, 1995). They propose that developing countries likely lose the technological innovation capacity of their local firms in foreign trade due to low-end lock in the value chain and excessive reliance on international markets (Stokey, 1991; Young, 1991). Due to differences related to economic development and industrial competition, the actual effect of trade on technology innovation is changing. This paper argues that the coordination between domestic and foreign trade reflects the complexity of trade in a country’s market (especially in large markets). Recent empirical literature also points to the close relationship between domestic and foreign trade. Domestic trade can promote adjustments to the export propensity by strengthening supply-demand matching and reducing market fragmentation and transaction costs (Zhang, 2014). In addition, domestic trade may also enhance the technical spillover effect of foreign trade and may lead to additional technology spillover effects via the tight connections between the two trading sectors.|$|E

40|$|The World Bank {{released}} a staff <b>trade</b> <b>note</b> on September 10 th 2003 {{looking at the}} impact of OECD cotton-sector subsidies on developing countries. Cotton was cited as an example 'where rich countries' trade policy negates the otherwise positive effects of their development policies'. The paper maintains that 'the cotton market is highly distorted' and that 'subsidies in relatively wealthy countries depress global prices'. This results in depressed incomes for millions of poor small holders in African countries. The paper looks in particular at the impact on Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali. The paper profiles the pattern of global cotton production (including production costs) and production trends over the past 40 years. It notes that 'real cotton prices have declined considerably during the last 40 years and that they 'are currently half their 1960 s levels'&# 133;. 'the current low level of cotton prices have been undoubtedly influenced by the support provided by major players'. The paper outlines {{the nature of the}} high levels of cotton subsidies in the USA and that in 2001 / 02 'producer prices in the United States were 91 % higher than world prices'. In the EU internal 'producer prices in Greece and Spain were 144 % and 184 % higher than world market prices'. The US$ 3. 7 billion in subsidies provided to 25, 000 US cotton farmers is 'three times the entire US aid budget to Africa'. At current prices it costs Burkina Faso more to get its cotton to market than the revenues it receives. Annual losses to African cotton farmers resulting from US subsidies are estimated at US$ 250 million a year. In Benin the 40 % reduction in farm-gate prices which has occurred has led to a 7 % reduction in rural per capita incomes and an increase in the incidence of poverty amongst cotton growers from 37 % to 59 %. Removal of support would 'reduce production and consequently boost prices, allowing third-world farmers to compete and earn profit on their crops'. Over the next ten years full liberalisation of the cotton sector would result in: an average increase of 12. 7 % in cotton prices; a 5. 8 % increase in world cotton trade; a 12. 6 % increase in African cotton exports. However such a liberalisation would {{in the case of the}} EU lead to a 70 % reduction in EU cotton production. The paper concludes that 'cutting subsidies would have major positive effects for poverty reduction, particularly in Africa'. Comment: A 70 % reduction in EU cotton production is scarcely an outcome consistent with the commitment under CAP reform to avoiding land abandonment. A complete liberalisation of the cotton sector and dismantling of systems of support is thus beyond the range of policy options which the EU is willing to consider under any reform of the cotton sector. Indeed, current proposals suggest only a partial decoupling of support in the cotton sector and only partial integration of the cotton sector into the system of single farm aid payments. For the EU the issue is about changing the basis of support to the cotton sector not withdrawing such support. While the EU is a relatively minor player in terms of cotton-sector distortions, with the US playing the major role, should the US decide to embark upon reform it is likely to follow an even more cautious approach to reform of the cotton secretor than the EU. The production and income gains to African farmers from any movements towards cotton-sector reform are thus unlikely to be substantial.
