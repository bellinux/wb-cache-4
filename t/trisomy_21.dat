5|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS or DNS), {{also known}} as <b>trisomy</b> <b>21,</b> is a genetic disorder caused {{by the presence of}} all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with <b>trisomy</b> <b>21</b> (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} a genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder is <b>Trisomy</b> <b>21,</b> also known as Down syndrome. This disorder usually results from an extra chromosome 21, although in uncommon instances it is related to other chromosomal abnormalities such as translocation of the genetic material. It is characterized by short stature, epicanthal (eyelid) folds, abnormal fingerprints, and palm prints, heart defects, poor muscle tone (delay of neurological development) and mental retardation (delay of intellectual development).|$|E
25|$|Human trisomies {{compatible}} with live birth, other than Down syndrome (<b>trisomy</b> <b>21),</b> are Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13).

25|$|The {{type and}} number of probes that are used on a sample depends on the indication. For sex {{determination}} (used for instance when a PCR protocol for a given X-linked disorder is not available), probes for the X and Y chromosomes are applied along with probes for {{one or more of}} the autosomes as an internal FISH control. More probes can be added to check for aneuploidies, particularly those that could give rise to a viable pregnancy (such as a <b>trisomy</b> <b>21).</b> The use of probes for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21 and 22 has the potential of detecting 70% of the aneuploidies found in spontaneous abortions.|$|E
25|$|Aneuploidy, {{which refers}} to {{abnormal}} number of chromosomes, can also be detected using non-invasive prenatal tests. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal trisomy 13 and <b>trisomy</b> <b>21,</b> {{and it is not}} elevated in fetal trisomy 18. A number of fetal nucleic acid molecules derived from aneuploid chromosomes can be detected including SERPINEB2 mRNA, clad B, hypomethylated SERPINB5 from chromosome 18, placenta-specific 4 (PLAC4), hypermethylated holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) and c21orf105 mRNA from chromosome 12. With complete trisomy, the mRNA alleles in maternal plasma isn't the normal 1:1 ratio, but is in fact 2:1. Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers {{can also be used to}} detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal aneuploidy detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several cell-free fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for aneuploidy, mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing. Sampling of cffDNA from maternal blood for analysis by massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 96 and 100%, and a specificity between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome. It can be performed at 10 weeks of gestational age. One study in the United States estimated a false positive rate of 0.3% and a positive predictive value of 80% when using cffDNA to detect Down syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (<b>Trisomy</b> <b>21)</b> and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E

40|$|Prenatal {{diagnosis}} of fetal trisomies is usually performed by cytogenetic analysis on amniotic fluid.

40|$|The {{presence}} of foetal DNA in the plasma {{of pregnant women}} has opened up new possibilities for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. The use of circulating foetal DNA for the non-invasive prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies is challenging as foetal DNA represents a minor fraction of maternal plasma DNA. In 2007, it was shown that single molecule counting methods would allow the detection of the {{presence of}} a trisomic foetus, as long as enough molecules were counted. With the advent of massively parallel sequencing, millions or billions of DNA molecules can be readily counted. Using massively parallel sequencing, foetal <b>trisomies</b> <b>21,</b> 13 and 18 have been detected from maternal plasma. Recently, large-scale clinical studies have validated the robustness of this approach for the prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies. A proof-of-concept study has also shown that a genome-wide genetic and mutational map of a foetus can be constructed from the maternal plasma DNA sequencing data. These developments suggest that the analysis of foetal DNA in maternal plasma would play an increasingly important role in future obstetrics practice.

These patients belong to two groups of Down syndrome patients characterized by different partial <b>trisomies</b> <b>21</b> : (i) duplication of the long arm, proximal to 21 q 22. 2, and (ii) duplication {{of the end of the}} chromosome, distal to 21 q 22. 2 We assessed the copy number of five chromosome 21 sequences (SOD 1, D 21 S 17, D 21 S 55, ETS 2, and D 21 S 15) and found that D 21 S 55 was duplicated in both cases.

50|$|Specific chromosomes: The {{influence}} of CPM on fetal growth is chromosome specific. Certain chromosomes carry imprinted genes involved in growth or placental function, which {{may contribute to}} impaired pregnancy progress when CPM is detected. Different chromosomes are observed at different frequencies {{depending on the type}} of CPM observed. The pregnancy outcome is strongly chromosome specific. The most frequently seen trisomic cells in confined placental mosaicism involve chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 8 and 16. The next frequently involved are 9, 13, 15, 18, 20 and 22. It has been observed that CPM involving the sex chromosomes usually has no adverse effects on fetal development. The common autosomal <b>trisomies</b> (<b>21,</b> 18, 13) made up a smaller number of cases of mosaicism detected on CVS, but were more often confirmed in fetal tissue (19%). On the other hand, the uncommon autosomal trisomies accounted for a greater number of placental mosaicism cases, but were less often confirmed in fetal tissue (3.2%). When CPM is detected on CVS involving certain chromosomes which are known or suspected to carry imprinted genes, molecular investigations should be performed to exclude fetal UPD. We will explore chromosome specific cases in the chromosome specific section.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse the positive predictive value (PPV) of <b>trisomies</b> <b>21,</b> 18 and 13 after referral for advanced maternal age (AMA), first trimester combined test or ultrasound findings to suggest improvements for clinical practice. METHODS: Data (48 457 combined tests, 134 000 fetal anomaly scans and 24 379 invasive prenatal tests) were combined to calculate PPV and termination of pregnancy rates. RESULTS: For referral for AMA, the PPV for T 21 was 1. 0 % and 1. 8 % for amniocentesis and chorionic villus biopsy, respectively; for the combined test at a maternal age >/= 36 years, these percentages were 4. 9 % and 12. 5 %, respectively and for maternal age 90 % unless detected after referral for ultrasound findings (71. 5 - 85. 9 %). About 50 % of pregnant women with a high combined test risk chose not to have invasive testing. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced MA is still a large contributor to invasive testing but should be abandoned (low PPV, high fetal loss rate) and be replaced by reimbursable combined test screening for all women. Patient information on second trimester ultrasound screening should indicate that abnormal ultrasound findings are associated with high trisomy rate. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
