5|$|Throughout {{the city}} there are {{numerous}} statues and sculptures representing characters from the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. They include the Steadfast <b>Tin</b> <b>Soldier,</b> the Mermaid, the Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep, the Toad, the Darning Needle, the Emperor's New Clothes, the Sea Horse, the Paper Boat, the Flying Trunk and the Wild Swans. There is also a distinctive statue of Andersen in Eventyrparken (The Fairy Tale Park) beside the cathedral. Sculpted by Louis Hasselriis in 1888, it shows the storyteller with a book in his hand, ready to entertain onlookers with his fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{first began}} {{exploring}} a possible live action/animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made. In March 1940, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate Andersen's fairy tales. The animated sequences {{would be based}} on some of Andersen's best known works, such as The Little Mermaid, The Little Match Girl, The Steadfast <b>Tin</b> <b>Soldier,</b> The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, The Ugly Duckling, The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even {{as far back as the}} 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. After the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney–Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942. Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled Hans Christian Andersen, with Danny Kaye as Andersen, Charles Vidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank Loesser penning the songs. All of Andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other Andersen fairy tales (including The Little Mermaid), were shelved.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Starevich {{moved to}} Fontenay-sous-Bois, {{where he lived}} {{until his death in}} 1965. There where made the rest of his films. Among the most notable are The Eyes of the Dragon (1925), a Chinese tale with complex and {{wonderful}} sets and character design, in which Starewitch shows his talent of decorator artist and ingenious trick-filmmaker, The Town Rat and the Country Rat (1926), a parody of American slapstick films, The Magical Clock (1928), a fairytale with amazing middle-age puppets and sets, starring Nina Star and music by Paul Dessau, The Little Parade, from Andersen's tale The Steadfast <b>Tin</b> <b>Soldier.</b> Six weeks after the premiere of The Little Parade, sound was added by Louis Nalpas companny. Starewitch started a collaboration with him, wishing to make a feature full-length film: Le Roman de Renard. All his 20's films are available on DVD.|$|E

500|$|In his December 1999 {{review for}} the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film {{a rating of}} three stars out of four. He {{described}} some of the animation, such as Firebird Suite, his favorite segment, as [...] "powerful" [...] though others, like the dance of the abstract triangles in Symphony No. 5, [...] "a little pedestrian". He admired Rhapsody in Blue and its interlocking stories, pointing out its style was reminiscent of the Madeline picture books by Ludwig Bemelmans. He thought Pines of Rome presented itself well in the IMAX format and found the Piano Concerto No. 2 played [...] "wonderfully as a self-contained film". He found The Sorcerer's Apprentice to be [...] "not as visually sharp {{as the rest of}} the film". He nonetheless described the film on the whole as [...] "splendid entertainment". Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "often has the feel of a giant corporate promotion whose stars are there simply to hawk the company's wares" [...] while noting the film [...] "is not especially innovative in its look or subject matter." [...] Firebird Suite was his favorite segment which left [...] "a lasting impression of the beauty, terror, and unpredictability of the natural world". He found The Sorcerer's Apprentice fit well with the rest of the film and the battle in Symphony No. 5 too abbreviated to amount to much. He found the segment with the whales failed in that the images [...] "quickly become redundant". He found Rhapsody in Blue to be the second-best in the film with its witty, hyper kinetic evocation of the melting pot with sharply defined characters. He found the segment with the flamingos cute and the one with the <b>tin</b> <b>soldier</b> to be romantic. James Berardinelli found the film to be of uneven quality. He felt Symphony No. 5 was [...] "dull and uninspired", the yo-yoing flamingos [...] "wasteful", and the New York City-based story of Rhapsody in Blue interesting but out of place in this particular movie. He found the story of the <b>tin</b> <b>soldier</b> to successfully mix its music with [...] "top-notch animation" [...] and [...] "an emotionally rewarding story". He felt the Firebird section was [...] "visually ingenious", and Pomp and Circumstance the most light-hearted episode and the one with the most appeal to children, in an otherwise adult-oriented film. To him The Sorcerer's Apprentice was an enduring classic.|$|E
500|$|Piano Concerto No. 2 was {{directed}} by Butoy with art director Michael Humphries. It originated in the 1930s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales into an animated film. The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories, including ones for The Steadfast <b>Tin</b> <b>Soldier</b> from 1938 by Bianca Majolie that were stored in the studio's animation research library and used for a 1991 Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches. When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece, Butoy flipped through the book and found the story's structure fit to the music. When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt in mind to give the segment a [...] "timeless" [...] feel, while keeping the colors [...] "as romantic as possible" [...] during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted. Live action footage of a real ballerina {{was used as a}} guide for the toy ballerina's movements. Butoy found the Jack-in-a-box a difficult character to design and animate with its spring base and how he moved with the box. His appearance went through numerous changes, partly {{due to the lack of}} reference material available to the team.|$|E
2500|$|By 1888 Dresser {{believed}} his songs would have popular {{appeal to a}} national audience. He stopped selling his songs through midwestern publishers, moved to New York City, and turned to Willis Woodward and Company, a New York City music publisher located {{in the area that}} later became known as Tin Pan Alley. Woodward and Company printed [...] "nearly three dozen" [...] of Dresser's songs. Dresser continued traveling with The Two Johns show until the end of 1889 and composed music after the show season ended. In 1890 Dresser began performing in A <b>Tin</b> <b>Soldier.</b> Managed by Frank McKee, the Charles Hale Hoyt production was in its fourth season when Dresser joined the twelve-member cast. Dresser, who had been large since his youth and weighed nearly , performed as a jolly plumber in the nationally-acclaimed show. [...] "Days Gone By" [...] and other Dresser songs were included in the show. He began to have a dispute with Hoyt over the use of his songs, and Hoyt’s refusal to acknowledge him as the composer. Dresser left the act in April 1891 and traveled the country performing in The Danger Signal. Dresser also began to sell his songs to other acts for use in their performances. After they made his songs famous, Dresser would then publish the sheet music and sell them through the firms on Tin Pan Alley. Dresser's songs and acts were usually sad and melodramatic, but a few were romantic and silly.|$|E

2500|$|Dresser {{grew up in}} a {{large family}} and lived in Sullivan and Terre Haute, Indiana. He had a troubled {{childhood}} and spent several weeks in jail. Dresser left home at age sixteen to join a [...] traveling minstrel act and performed in several regional theaters before joining John Hamlin's Wizard Oil traveling medicine-wagon show in 1878. Dresser composed his first songs while working for Hamlin. Dresser settled in Evansville, Indiana, for several years, while as he continued to work as a traveling performer and musician. Eventually, he became a nationally-known talent and traveled with a number of different acts, including The Two Johns, A <b>Tin</b> <b>Soldier,</b> and The Danger Signal, among others. Dresser wrote songs featured in these shows, sold his songs to others acts, and published his music. In 1893 Dresser joined [...] "Howley, Haviland and Company", a New York City sheet music publisher, as a silent partner. He later became an active partner in other music publishing companies. At the height of his success, Dresser lived in New York City as a wealthy entertainer, successful songwriter, and sheet music publisher. He was also known for his generosity, especially to family and friends, and lavish spending. At {{the turn of the century}} Dresser fell into financial distress when his music fell out of style. In 1905 his music publishing business declared bankruptcy and Dresser's health declined. He died penniless in New York City a year later.|$|E
