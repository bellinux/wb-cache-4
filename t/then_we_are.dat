5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

500|$|Fiasco, {{along with}} rappers Common, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, has been {{credited}} as {{a pioneer of}} the conscious hip hop movement, which focuses on social issues. [...] Subjects touched upon on Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor include absent parents, terrorism, Islam and religion, war, and prostitution. [...] Fiasco attributes his interest in social issues to his highly cultured upbringing, as he describes his mother as [...] "very intellectual" [...] and his father as a [...] "Renaissance man". [...] He rejects the misogyny common in hip hop, which he discusses in the song [...] "Hurt Me Soul". [...] Despite this, Fiasco is strongly opposed to censorship in music: [...] "If we're going to [...] that are offensive, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{going to have to}} blind and deafen everyone. Come on, man. Let's focus on education and literacy and poverty." ...|$|E
500|$|Greenfield became Premier {{at a time}} of {{agricultural}} depression, especially in the province's south. [...] The region, which was responsible for approximately 75% of Alberta's wheat production, {{was in the midst of}} its fifth consecutive year of drought, and the farmers who had been responsible for putting the UFA into office were now demanding action. [...] Initially, the government offered direct financial assistance, with $5 million provided in seed and grain relief by the end of 1922. [...] However, this effort was driving the province close to bankruptcy, and in 1923 Greenfield announced an end to the handouts (the bill authorizing the last of these was a source of chagrin for MLAs from all parties, both because it marked the end of direct assistance for farmers and because the last of the assistance was itself so expensive). [...] Farmers and political representatives from the affected areas criticized the government bitterly, referencing Greenfield's earlier pledge that [...] "if the south country should fall, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> prepared to fall with it".|$|E
500|$|Lewis did {{not share}} the desire of some members to keep the CCF [...] "ideologically pure", and adhered to the Bundist belief that [...] "it was better {{to go along with}} the masses in a not totally correct {{direction}} than to separate oneself from them and remain 'purist'." [...] However, the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party, and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations. [...] Lewis criticized the British Columbia CCF for such comments, saying [...] "... what we say and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action. [...] If what we say and do will blunt or harm our purpose... <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saying and doing a false thing even if, in the abstract, it is true... When, in heaven's name are we going to learn that working-class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday-school class where purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] an [...] "A+." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] "one {{of those}} deliciously dense episodes {{in which the}} nourishment of revelation is mixed with huge chunks of sugary intrigue" [...] and speculated that the scene in which Alex is executed will be [...] "sitting very high on this ranking of all-time pivotal Lost moments" [...] by the series' May 2010 end. [...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [...] should expect from here on out <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in for some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here." [...] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and the pilot and losing to [...] "The Constant." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E

2500|$|In 1739, David Hume in his A Treatise of Human Nature {{approached}} {{free will}} via {{the notion of}} causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things regularly succeeding one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that result in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things). According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: [...] "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> left with a very weak notion of necessity." ...|$|E
