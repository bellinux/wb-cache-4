5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> through the native {{populations of the}} Americas. The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of the entire Yucatán Peninsula. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. The terrible plagues <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> the peninsula were recorded in Yucatec Maya written histories, which combined with those of neighbouring Maya peoples in the Guatemalan Highlands, suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico with the forces under the command of Pánfilo Narváez. Old World diseases are often mentioned only briefly in indigenous accounts, making it difficult to identify the exact culprit. Among the most deadly were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis; the latter disease was attributed to the arrival of the Spanish by the Maya inhabitants of Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|The mutiny was memorialized {{most famously}} by Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin, {{although}} the French silent film La Révolution en Russe (Mutiny on a Man-of-War in Odessa or Revolution in Odessa, 1905), directed by Ferdinand Zecca or Lucien Nonguet (or both), {{was the first}} film to depict the mutiny, preceding Eisenstein's far more famous film by 20 years. Filmed shortly after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22, with the derelict battleship Dvenadsat Apostolov standing in for the broken-up Potemkin, Eisenstein recast the mutiny into a predecessor of the October Revolution of 1917 <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> the Bolsheviks to power. He emphasized their role, and implied that the mutiny failed because Matushenko and the other leaders were not better Bolsheviks. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatize the story, ignoring the major fire <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> through Odessa's dock area while Potemkin was anchored there, combining the many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on the steps (today known as Potemkin Stairs), and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed.|$|E

It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Ch'ol and Ch’olti’ Maya in western Petén {{at the start of}} the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.|$|E

This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The Great Fire of London {{was a major}} {{conflagration}} <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> {{through the}} central parts of the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666. The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It threatened but did not reach the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, {{and most of the}} suburban slums. It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The evacuation, {{which had}} been delayed for months, was {{initiated}} due to fear of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a military necessity, Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both spurious and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> through the military and civilian populations.|$|E

5|$|When Flem D. Sampson {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1927, he appointed Willis {{to fill his}} seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In 1928, Willis was elected to a full four-year term representing the Court's Seventh Appellate District. Holding a state-level office increased his political stature, as did revising Thornton on the Law of Oil and Gas, a six-volume law reference, during his time on the bench. His political image was not badly tarnished when he lost his seat on the court to Alex Ratliff during the Democratic surge <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt into the presidency in 1932.

5|$|In 1903, Zaprešić {{railway station}} was a sight of two anti-Hungarian demonstrations caused by {{installing}} of panes with Hungarian inscriptions on railway objects across Croatia. The demonstrations {{were part of}} a wider national movement <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> the country at a time. In both occasions the demonstrations turned into a scuffle with local gendarmes which ended up with several peasants killed and dozens of locals arrested. Peasants that were killed or injuerd by the gendarmes are traditionally celebrated as a heroes and national martyrs. In their honour, two separate memorial boards were placed on the building of Zaprešić railway station in 1928. and 2003. After the First World War, the oldest meat industry in Croatia, the Industrija mesnih proizvoda, was founded.|$|E

5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} during {{a wave of}} monastic enthusiasm <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> through western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries. This wave was {{responsible}} for the foundation of the majority of England's monasteries, and very few were founded after the 13th century. These monasteries were often founded by a wealthy aristocratic benefactor who endowed and patronised the establishments in return for prayers for their soul, and often, the right to be buried within the monastic church. Leicester Abbey was founded in the Augustinian tradition. The monks at the abbey were known as canons, and followed the monastic rules set down by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white habit and black cloak), Augustinian Canons lived a clerical life engaged in public ministry; this is distinct to other forms of monasticism in which monks were cloistered from the outside world, and lived an isolated, contemplative life.|$|E
5|$|McGill University {{played a}} {{meaningful}} {{role in the}} Great War. Many students and alumni enlisted in {{the first wave of}} patriotic fervor <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> the nation in 1914, but in the spring of 1915 — after the first wave of heavy Canadian casualties at Ypres — Hamilton Gault, the founder of the Canadian regiment and a wealthy Montreal businessman, was faced with a desperate shortage of troops. When he reached out to his friends at home for support, over two hundred were commissioned from the ranks, and many more would serve as soldiers throughout the war. On their return to Canada after the war, Major George McDonald and Major George Currie formed the accounting firm McDonald Currie, which later became {{one of the founders of}} Price Waterhouse Coopers. Captain Percival Molson was killed in action in July 1917. Percival Molson Memorial Stadium at McGill is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|St. Charles Bay was {{the domain}} of the Karankawa Indians before the arrival of European settlers. The Spanish {{referred}} to the bay as Laguna del Bergantine, which translated to the Lagoon of the Brigantine. The name is the likely the source of Burgantine Lake, found at the bay's head. The name derived from a Spanish vessel that was being used to transfer money to Texas to bribe Mexican soldiers at Goliad and San Antonio in 1818. It was caught in an Aransas Bay storm <b>that</b> <b>swept</b> the ship into the waters of St. Charles Bay, landing in a creek at its base. Supposedly, the ship was abandoned in the surrounding prairie (Fagan ranch near Tivoli, Texas), and its parts used by area settlers (later determined to be the Fagan family) to build homes.|$|E
