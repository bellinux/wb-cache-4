40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to verify the {{thermodynamic}} proprierties of a double and <b>triple</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> {{and the existence of}} a melting temperature with a sharp phase transition from a bound state to two or three single <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> The DNA chains are represented by a Markov process in a direct lattice with 1 + 1, 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 dimensions where the Metropolis and the Wang-Landau algorithms are implemented. The Wang-Landau algorthm allows to estimate the density of states in energy space g(E) and with it the averange value of internal energy and the specific heat.

In this study, the 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyadenosine (8 -oxoA) can replace 2 '-deoxycytidine for forming a base triad with a base pair guanine and cytosine. The target for the tripler {{formation is}} a motif of a promotor (5 '-d-TTGGGGGGGAA, - 3 - - 12 of PKCalpha m-RNA) of mouse protein kinase C-alpha. The probes contain 20 bases with a common sequence 5 '-d-XXXXXXTTCCCCCCAA. The XXXXXX portion may contain either 5 -methyl- 2 '-deoxycytidines, six 8 -oxoA's or both. Only the probe with a motif of six 8 -oxoA's can for triplex with the target {{in the presence of}} magnesium ion and spermine at neutral pH.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to investigate, using {{simplified}} lattice models, whether the Efimov effect, well known in quantum mechanics, can arise in polymer physics too, particularly in a <b>triple</b> <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> system. Such effect consists {{in the formation of}} stable trimer bound states when dimer bound states are not stable. We base strand interaction rules on a Poland-Scheraga model for a directed DNA-like polymer, double-stranded first and triple-stranded later. Within the Poland-Scheraga scheme, only interactions between base pairs with the same monomer indexes along the strands are permitted. Thus, the identification of the monomer index with imaginary time allows the formal mapping to the quantum problem in which particles interact at the same time. According to the transfer matrix method, we are able to extract information about the free-energy of the system from matrix eigenvalues. Studying them at the critical point of the unzipped-zipped phase transition we look for the similarities between the bound states in the polymer model and those predicted by Efimov theory for a three particle quantum system. In particular, in Efimov theory, an infinite series of trimer energy levels, with a constant ratio between consecutive levels, is found at the critical point of the 2 -body problem...|$|R

With the homo A/T target increased cleavage is observed towards the 3 '-end on the pyrimidine strand. These results show that the third strand is asymmetrically positioned along the groove with the tightest <b>triple</b> <b>strand</b> double strand interactions at the 5 '-end of the third strand. The results also indicate that homo-A versus mixed A/G 'Hoogsteen-triple helices' have different structures...|$|R

Binding to the native double <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> conformation induced strong quenching in fluorescence spectrum of thionine. Linear Scatchard plots indicated the binding to be of one type and the affinity values evaluated {{to be of the}} order of 105 M− 1 with double <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> Fluorescence quenching was much weaker with single <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> and the binding affinity was about one order lower. Ferrocyanide quenching studies revealed that the fluorescence emission of dye molecules bound to the double <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> was quenched much less compared to those bound to the single <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> Furthermore, there was significant emission polarization for the bound dye molecules and strong energy transfer from the DNA base pairs to the dye molecules indicating intercalative binding to ds DNA.

The intercalation of the dye molecules to double <b>stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> and simple stacking to single strands was proved from these fluorescence techniques.
