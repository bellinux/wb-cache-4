Two important equations of the Weyl tensor are formulated which help to analyze the energy density inhomogeneity in this scenario. We investigate two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluids,</b> <b>i.</b> e., non-dissipative and dissipative. The non-dissipative fluid further includes dust, locally isotropic, and locally anisotropic charged fluids.

Its ore bodies, occurring as lode, are hosted in biotite-amphibole-plagiogneiss of the Taihua Group and controlled by subsidiary faults of the Machaying fault which is the south boundary fault of the Xiong'er terrane. Three stages of hydrothermal ore - forming process are recognized, Quartz-molybdenite (I), which is the main metallogenic stage, Quartz-polymetallic sulfide (II) and Quartz-carbonate (III). Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> inclusions, <b>i.</b> e. H 2 O-NaCl, daughter mineral-bearing, are observed.

The broad range of homogeneous temperatures of stage I, the evolution of salinities from bimodal to unimodal, and negative correlation between homogeneous temperatures and salinities indicate that fluid mixing is the most important metallogenic mechanism in Zhaiwa Mo deposit.

40|$|Performance {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> nanofluids {{in influencing}} the heat transfer phenomena {{in the context}} of compact channels has been presented. Experiments have been conducted in forced convection regime for a range of Reynolds numbers. Three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> coolant <b>fluids</b> <b>i.</b> e. de-ionized water (base fluid), Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 -based dilute nanofluids with volumetric concentrations of 0. 005 %, 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % have been employed. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer has been used for recording the real time projection data of the convective field. The interferometer has been operated in infinite as well as wedge fringe setting mode. The infinite fringe setting images have been employed for discussing the effect of nanoparticles on phenomena like thermal boundary layer profiles, changes in the thickness of thermal boundary layers, etc. The wedge interferograms have been employed for quantitative analysis. A direct comparison of heat transfer characteristics of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 nanoparticles has been presented {{on the basis of their}} relative influence on the thickness of thermal boundary layers, temperature gradients and the resultant heat transfer rates. The results of the study clearly reveal the effectiveness and higher heat transfer characteristics of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles than that of SiO 2. It is seen that the Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles have greater ability in disrupting the thermal boundary layer profiles and lead to higher percentage reduction in the thickness of thermal boundary layers. The resultant heat transfer coefficients with Al 2 O 3 -based dilute nanofluids have been found to be significantly higher than the base fluid and the SiO 2 -based nanofluids for any given volumetric concentration. It is experimentally demonstrated that the phenomena like increased thermal conductivity, boundary layer disruptions and advection effects primarily control the heat transfer rates in the lower range of Reynolds numbers (Re < 500) while at higher Reynolds numbers, it is mainly the advection effects that influence the heat transfer coefficients in the range of volume concentrations of dilute nanofluids employed in the experiments.

40|$|The thermocapillary {{convection}} is induced along a liquid-vapor interface due {{to surface}} tension gradient which is temperature dependent. Due {{to the large}} increase in surface area relative to volume, surface tension has a dominant effect on the fluid behavior in a capillary structure. Evaporation of a thin film induces temperature gradient and hence surface tension gradient along the liquid-vapor interface, leading to Marangoni convection which is regarded as thermocapillary flow. The evaporation of a liquid thin film is governed by the transport processes <b>of</b> the working <b>fluid,</b> thus the selection <b>of</b> appropriate working <b>fluid</b> for a designated range of operating temperature is of vital importance in delineating the thermal performance of a two-phase capillary structure. The impact of thermocapillary effect on the thermal and <b>fluid</b> flow behaviors <b>of</b> an evaporating thin liquid film is investigated in this thesis. By employing the long-wave evolution model, a mathematical model based on first principles for fluid flow and heat transfer is derived for the interface shapes that govern {{the thickness of the}} evaporating thin film. The two-dimensional information of the liquid temperature which is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the thermocapillary effect can be obtained. The evaporation rate is overrated when the thermocapillary effect is neglected and the overestimate increases with increasing excess temperature. The theoretical model is further deployed to investigate the effect of thermo-physical properties on the impact of thermocapillary effect on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> working <b>fluids,</b> <b>i.</b> e. polar and non-polar liquids. The temperature gradients induced by different degree of thermo-physical properties are closely associated with the Marangoni number in justifying the significance of thermocapillary effect in an evaporating thin liquid film. Surface tension gradient induced by temperature gradient is usually in the negative linear variation form. The thermocapillary flow provoked by the negative surface tension gradient retards the liquid circulation and impedes evaporation process. Water portrays a unique thermocapillary characteristic where the thermocapillary flow manifests in the form of swirls along the liquid-vapor interface at a large excess temperature. By introducing the dilute aqueous solution (DAS) of long-chain alcohol, the temperature dependence surface tension can be modified into a quadratic function to analyse the thermocapillary action engendered by the positive surface tension gradient of DAS in the evaporating thin liquid film. To investigate the thermocapillary effect on the thermal and <b>fluid</b> flow characteristics <b>of</b> the pseudoplastic <b>fluid,</b> the Ostwald-de Waele power law model is employed. The power-law model is developed with the power-law index ranges between 0 to 1 for pseudoplastic (shear-thinning) <b>fluids.</b> The significance <b>of</b> thermocapillary effect in the pseudoplastic fluid is determined by the critical Marangoni number. Results show that the total heat transfer rate of both Newtonian and pseudoplastic fluids is overestimated with the presence of thermocapillary effect and the overestimate is comparatively pronounced in the Newtonian fluid compared to the pseudoplastic fluid. This study reveals the conditions under which the thermocapillary effect is significant and should not be neglected in the heat transfer analysis of an evaporating thin film...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{multiphase}} fluid inclusions are abundant in skarn wollastonite from a contact-metamorphic ureole near Mérida, Spain. Wollastonite is found along {{the boundaries between}} marble and interbedded metachert layers and nodules. At room temperature, <b>fluid</b> inclusions consist <b>of</b> an aqueous liquid, a bubble and several solids (wollastonite, calcite, apatite, quartz, halite and sylvite have been identified). Wollastonite and calcite are always present and show a fairly uniform phase ratio suggesting that they are daughter minerals. The solid assemblage, except the chlorides, does not dissolve appreciably, even at 5509 C. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fluidinclusions are found: Type I, which contains no visible halite and sylvite, and lype II, which contains halite(± sylvite). The first type seems to be ubiquitous within the aureole, whereas the second is restricted to theproximity to the granite contact. An estimation of the composition <b>of</b> the trapped <b>fluid</b> has been made for two cases <b>of</b> <b>Types</b> <b>I</b> and II <b>fluid</b> inclusions. They were highly saline brines, especially the Type II fluids. Total salinity is 52 wt% in the case <b>of</b> <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>fluids,</b> and rises to ca. 69 wt% in Type II fluids. The CaCl 2 content is remarkably high (ca. 39 and 45 t% respectively); silica content (as SiO 2 °) is also high in both cases (11. 2 and 7. 4 wt% respectively) and CO 2 olar fraction is close to 0. 05 in both fluids. These fluids are interpreted as exhaust fluids resulting from the wollastonite-forming reaction. aking into account the inability of H 2 O-NaCl fluids to incorporate significant amounts of Ca into solution, we suggest that HC 1 of granitic origin was an important component in the primary fluid entering the arble-metachert sequence, thus explaining the high solubility of wollastonite and calcite (and probably also uartz) at the expected temperatures of trapping <b>of</b> the <b>fluid</b> inclusions. This primary fluid was a moderately aline brine with H 2 O-NaCl-(KCl-MgCl 2) -HCl and aqueous SiO 2, as major components, and minor amounts of CO 2 and P. The range <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> compositions recorded by fluid inclusions can be explained {{as a result of}} mixing of either the primary fluid, or the exhaust fluid, with a low-salinity brine. Precipitation of wollastonite (and probably also in part, calcite and quartz) inside fluid inclusions was probably favoured by outward diffusion of hydrogen through the wollastonite host...|$|R
