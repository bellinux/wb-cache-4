5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
5|$|Geppetto {{discovers that}} his wish has come true, and {{is filled with}} joy. However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> can help him.|$|E

5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E

25|$|Zhurong was {{captured}} another two {{times by the}} Shu army. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> {{was captured}}, she had marched alongside her husband and their army to finish off the Shu army {{as they had been}} falsely informed that their ally Wutugu's army had nearly obliterated the Shu forces. However, much to their dismay, Shu had actually routed Wutugu's army, and then they proceeded to capture Zhurong.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year she ran 12.95 seconds {{at the start}} of June (ultimately ranking in the global top forty that season). However, this proved to be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> ran that fast, as she suffered a severe injury to her left foot during training, breaking the bone and having surgery as a result. She attempted a return, but additional complications forced her to retire from athletics.|$|E
25|$|In late 1963, {{the band}} of the Black Watch Regiment {{conducted}} a three-month performance tour of the United States. Several days before John F.

500|$|Although in the 1920s Elgar's {{music was}} no longer in fashion, his admirers {{continued}} to present his works when possible. Reed singles out a performance of the Second Symphony in March 1920 conducted by [...] "a young man almost unknown to the public", Adrian Boult, for bringing [...] "the grandeur and nobility of the work" [...] to a wider public. Also in 1920, Landon Ronald presented an all-Elgar concert at the Queen's Hall. Alice Elgar wrote with enthusiasm about the reception of the symphony, but this was one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>times</b> <b>she</b> heard Elgar's music played in public. After a short illness, she died of lung cancer on 7 April 1920, at the age of seventy-two.|$|R

Hopestar {{returned}} to Liverpool on 12 June, sailing two weeks later for Charleston, South Carolina, United States, which is where she was when the war finally ended. She again sailed Mediterranean waters before arriving at Middlesbrough, Yorkshire on 14 November.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 {{she moved}} back to New York without McCarthy, and the two {{apparently}} were divorced sometime that year. She began plans for a portfolio of African Americans and interviewed several families in Harlem with whom she hoped to live while documenting their lives.

25|$|Deaths {{of members}} of the royal family have {{occurred}} in connection to the appearance of the White Lady in the palace. In March 1871, Princess Eugenie saw the ghost and three days later Queen Louise died. The White Lady appeared again in 1907, and shortly after that, King Oscar II died. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> was seen was in 1920, when Princess Margaret lay dying. Suddenly the flag at the palace was lowered to half mast and a guard is said to have seen the White Lady on the roof. Two hours after this the princess died.|$|E
25|$|Nadia Comăneci {{needed a}} score of 9.925 to tie or more than that to win the gold outright. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> had scored as high as this in an AA final was at the 76 Olympics. Out of the 100 {{optional}} beam exercises performed at the 1980 Olympics only 1 scored as high as Comaneci needed. After one of her back flips Comaneci had to flail her arms for balance. She broke the connection between her aerial walkover to aerial cartwheel with a pause. Her knee bent slightly under 360-degree rotation. She landed slightly askew, taking a step back (normally a 0.1 deduction).|$|E

Captain A. McArthur had been master of the Isaac M. Scott since her maiden voyage back in 1909 and sailed with 27 other men on the Isaac M. Scotts last voyage. Had he known how ugly the weather was about to become he surely would have never left port.|$|E

25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that this might be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they were waiting {{to see how it}} progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time in}} a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E
