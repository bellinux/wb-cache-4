5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} had passed and Tewodros had not {{received}} a reply, he imprisoned Cameron, together with all the British subjects in Ethiopia and various other Europeans, {{in an attempt to}} get the queen's attention. His prisoners included a missionary named Mr. Stern, who had previously published a book in Europe describing Tewodros as a barbaric, cruel, unstable usurper.

Tewodros also received reports from abroad that foreign papers had quoted these European residents of Ethiopia as having said many negative <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> and his reign.|$|E

500|$|Mahone {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} character, and his past is revealed as the series progresses. According to series creator Paul Scheuring, the writers try to let all {{the characters in the}} show [...] "inhabit a gray area." [...] Scheuring says that although Mahone's pursuit in the second season is very noble, [...] "there are some <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that we will learn that are slightly less than noble."

500|$|In May 2007, Lonsdale {{appeared}} on BBC's Panorama {{program in a}} piece titled [...] "Scientology and Me", and was interviewed about his experiences as a critic of Scientology by journalist John Sweeney. When Sweeney asked Lonsdale why the Church of Scientology was publicizing derogatory <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> Lonsdale replied: [...] "They are trying to embarrass me. They try to paint you as crazy, {{so that no one}} will listen to you." [...] During their interview, Tommy Davis arrived, opened a folder, and began to read out loud Lonsdale's criminal record.

500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son.

But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E
