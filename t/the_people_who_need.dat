25|$|The use of {{advanced}} triage may become necessary when medical professionals {{decide that the}} medical resources available are not sufficient to treat all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> help. The treatment being prioritized can include the time spent on medical care, or drugs or other limited resources. This has happened in disasters such as terrorist attacks, mass shootings, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and rail accidents. In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because {{of the severity of}} their injuries. Others would live if given immediate medical care, but would die without it.|$|E
25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what {{many of us have}} been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces of the same coin to be spent on more and better services for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E
25|$|DN3: (Defense against natural disasters). The Army {{should always}} be ready to help the civil {{population}} in case of disaster. This includes preventive measures. For example, between August and November, military forces are sent to Mexican coastal areas to aid {{the public in the}} event of hurricanes or floods. For the Mexican people, the DN3 plan is the most important peacetime operation of the Army. The Army provides food, shelter, medicine, and medical services to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> them. This also includes reconstruction of roads and communication services. Because calling the implementation DN3 plan is an acceptance of severe problems, the DN3 plan was not invoked in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that left large areas of Mexico City in ruins, since the authorities did not want to recognize there was an emergency in the capital, while the army was called to the city, it was just a peacekeeping force. This later became a severe questioning on the government. The Mexican Army provided aid to the US following Hurricane Katrina. More recently, the DN3 plan was invoked in 2009 when an epidemic of swine flu threatened the population and in 2010 after the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Nuevo León, Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero were severely affected by floods caused by a number of hurricanes and tropical storms.|$|E

2500|$|Montaigne's {{education}} {{began in}} early childhood and followed a pedagogical plan {{that his father had}} developed, refined by the advice of the latter's humanist friends. Soon after his birth, Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived {{the first three years of}} life in the sole company of a peasant family, in order to, according to the elder Montaigne, [...] "draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> our help". After these first spartan years, Montaigne was brought back to the château. The objective was for Latin to become his first language.|$|E
2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you can't do that unless you're where <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... the kids were coming out of the seats and standing in the aisles to come up and rock out with us... They just shut us down... The park security and promoters evidently thought we were just evil and inciting riots." [...] At the secular show they reported that they could [...] "...connect with the kids, you know, just be real... same exact response from the crowd, and that's why I feel that's where we belong." ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{some experts}} argue that {{international}} organizations should distribute ITNs and LLINs to people for free to maximize coverage (since {{such a policy}} would reduce price barriers), others insist that cost-sharing between the international organization and recipients would lead to greater use of the net (arguing that people will value a good more if they pay for it). Additionally, proponents of cost-sharing argue that such a policy ensures that nets are efficiently allocated to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> most <b>need</b> them (or are most vulnerable to infection). Through a [...] "selection effect", they argue, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> most <b>need</b> <b>the</b> bed nets will choose to purchase them, while those less in need will opt out.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} the problems users and vendors encountered with EDIF 2 0 0, one first has to picture {{all the elements}} and dynamics of the electronics industry. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> this standard were mainly design engineers, who worked for companies whose size ranged from a house garage to multi-billion dollar facilities with thousands of engineers. These engineers worked mainly from schematics and netlists in the late 1980s, and the big push was to generate the netlists from the schematics automatically. The first suppliers were Electronic Design Automation vendors (e.g., Daisy, Mentor, and Valid formed the earliest predominating set). These companies competed vigorously for their shares of this market.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first step}} is {{targeting}} or finding <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> help <b>the</b> most. This is done through what BRAC calls [...] "participatory wealth ranking" [...] - gathering about 40 to 50 <b>people</b> in <b>the</b> village or community to determine the poorest. Program staff follow up with in-person visits to potential participants, using a set of standard criteria - number of meals a day, whether their roof is thatched or tin, and so on - to determine who qualifies. Senior managers then verify the selection. It's a mix of bottom-up participatory involvement and top-down supervision, intended {{to ensure that no}} ultra-poor are left out, and funds are not wasted on those who could benefit from a less costly intervention.|$|R
50|$|Air Evac Lifeteam {{was founded}} in 1985 to serve the rural Missouri Ozark area. Although air {{ambulances}} were primarily based in metropolitan areas at the time, the company founders believed that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> air medical transport the most were those living in rural areas, often far away from a hospital. Air Evac now focuses on providing services to the medically underserved areas of rural America, often in those rural areas which other air ambulances may not adequately service or may not look at servicing. Serving those areas where advanced or critical care access may be limited or nonexistent continues to play {{a large role in}} the areas that it serves. As the company has grown and evolved since 1985, it has remained true to its original mission and a patient first focus.|$|R

The original made-for-TV film, Dial Hot Line, had a social worker called David Leopold, also played by Edwards. Ellison asked executive producer Irving Elman about the name change, {{and was told that}} there'd been a number of jokes about it and references to the Leopold and Loeb murder case. Elman was afraid viewers would make the same connection. Subsequent to this interview, Ellison said he received a letter from a Minneapolis hotline worker, Martha Rosen. She described unrealistic, authoritarian portrayals in Dial Hot Line that might damage the credibility of real hotlines, both with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> them, and with parents and authorities.|$|R
40|$|Making {{reference}} to the theories of Yves Clot's Activity Clinic, Foucault and Agamben, we carry out a theoretical reflection on health care workers when they are crossed by contemporaneous Capitalism's inflection. By a concise historical analysis, we consider that the health care practices have favored to have the control over an abstract biological body {{and that they have}} been crossed by a market logic, that takes immediate effects both on <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> medical treatment and those whose jobs are to take care of them. Considering the work as creative activity, we bring this article to a close suggesting that the care of others can be the same as caring for oneself, as postulated by Foucault, a kind of resistance against the changing {{of the health care system}} in a biopower emblematic territory, where the value of one life is decided by a sovereign, as Agamben have said...|$|R
