5|$|In {{line with}} Christian {{interpretation}} of the day, the slowdown of the fire during Saturday {{was seen as a}} result of divine intervention. To thank God, king Christian VI introduced on 23 October as a new annual holiday in 1731 on which every church in Copenhagen held a service of thanksgiving. <b>This</b> <b>holiday</b> was abolished at the holiday reform of 1770.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} summer, the Jewish harvest festival of Shavuot is celebrated.

These include cheeses and yogurts, cheese-based pies and quiches called pashtidot, cheese blintzes, and cheesecake prepared with soft white cheese (gvina levana) or cream cheese.|$|E

5|$|American network {{television}} broadcasts the show during prime time. The first few {{shows in the}} 1990s were held in the days preceding Valentine's Day to promote the brand for <b>this</b> <b>holiday.</b> They were not aired on national television. In 1999 and 2000 the show was webcast. Beginning in 2001, the shows were moved ahead of the Christmas holiday season. Also in 2001, the show made its {{network television}} broadcast on ABC, though in all subsequent years, it has been broadcast on CBS. The show has been held {{at a variety of}} locations in different cities including Miami, Los Angeles, Cannes, Paris, and London. The first four shows were held at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, but since it has become a televised event it has most often been held at the 69th Regiment Armory in New York City.|$|E

25|$|In most {{forms of}} Wicca, <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> is celebrated {{at the winter}} {{solstice}} as the rebirth of the Great horned hunter god, who is viewed as the newborn solstice sun. The method of gathering for this sabbat varies by practitioner. Some have private ceremonies at home, while others do so with their covens.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{dwelling}} in a sukkah, {{the principal}} ritual unique to <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> is {{use of the}} Four Species (lulav (palm), hadass (myrtle), aravah (willow) and etrog (citron). On {{each day of the}} holiday other than Shabbat, these are waved in association with the recitation of Hallel in the synagogue, then walked in a procession around the synagogue called the Hoshanot.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} a number of {{widespread}} customs observed on Shavuot. During <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> the Torah portion containing the Ten Commandments is read in the synagogue, and the biblical Book of Ruth is read as well. It is traditional to eat dairy meals during Shavuot. In observant circles, all night Torah study is common on the first night of Shavuot, while in Reform Judaism, Shavuot is the customary date for Confirmation ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|References to {{a holiday}} called 'Robanukah' appear in several episodes, as well, {{though it is}} heavily implied that Bender makes up <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> to avoid work. In the Futurama Holiday Spectacular, the Robanukah story {{involves}} a pair of fembots who must wrestle in petroleum oil for {{six and a half}} weeks. When the oil, which was predicted to last only four and a half weeks, lasts for 500 million years, Bender declares it a Robanukah miracle.|$|E
25|$|The Tekirdağ area is {{the site}} of many holiday homes, as the city is only two hours drive from Istanbul via a new four-lane highway. The villages of Şarköy, Mürefte and Kumbağ are {{particularly}} popular with Turkish tourists. Much of <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> property has been built in an unregulated and unplanned manner and thus much of the coast looks over-built. The Marmara Sea is polluted but there are still a number of public beaches near Tekirdağ, especially the Yeniçiftlik beaches.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark and Norway, the day {{is known}} as Fastelavn and is marked by eating fastelavnsboller. Fastelavn is the name for Carnival in Denmark which is either the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. Fastelavn {{developed}} from the Roman Catholic tradition of celebrating {{in the days before}} Lent, but after Denmark became a Protestant nation, the holiday became less specifically religious. <b>This</b> <b>holiday</b> occurs seven weeks before Easter Sunday, with children dressing up in costumes and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast. The holiday is generally considered to be a time for children's fun and family games.|$|E
25|$|The bowl system {{began in}} 1902 {{with the first}} ever East-West game in Pasadena, California, held at Tournament Park on New Year's Day in {{conjunction}} with the Tournament of Roses parade. This game was an exhibition game pitting a highly rated team from the west coast against a team from east of the Mississippi River. This was an ideal time for a postseason game, as fans could take off work or school during <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> period to travel to the game. In the first game, the University of Michigan Wolverines represented the east and easily defeated the west's representative Stanford by a score of 49–0. Due to the lopsided victory the game did not resume until 1916.|$|E
25|$|The feast day of saint Elias {{falls on}} July 20 of the Orthodox liturgical {{calendar}} (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, July 20 currently falls on August 2 {{of the modern}} Gregorian Calendar). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon {{and is one of}} a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> with fireworks.|$|E

25|$|Texas Tech's {{most recent}} bowl game win, the 2013 National University Holiday Bowl, {{occurred}} on December 30, 2013. The Red Raiders won, 37–23, against the Arizona State Sun Devils. The last, and only other, time these two teams met {{was in the}} 1999, in both teams' preseason opener despite both teams having been members of the Border Conference. In <b>this</b> <b>Holiday</b> Bowl meeting, the Red Raiders led the entire game, with the smallest lead of 7 points only lasting 11 seconds on the game clock, as Reginald Davis returned a 90-yard kickoff for a touchdown, to answer the Sun Devils' Taylor Kelly's 44-yard touchdown run, early in the third quarter. This was Kliff Kingsbury's first season as {{head coach of the}} Red Raiders.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the Day of the Dead as {{such was}} not celebrated in {{northern}} Mexico, {{where it was}} unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had different traditions. The people and the church rejected it as a day related to syncretizing pagan elements with Catholic Christianity. They held the traditional 'All Saints' Day' {{in the same way}} as other Christians in the world. There was limited Mesoamerican influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous inhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was celebrated. In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, Día de Muertos is observed because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on educational policies from the 1960s; it has introduced <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> as a unifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions.|$|E
25|$|Acting as head {{of state}} on 7 March, the King {{appointed}} to his Regency Council constitutional lawyers Srđan Budisavljević, Ante Mandić and Dušan Sernec. In doing so, the King empowered his Council to form a common temporary government with NKOJ and accept Tito's nomination as Prime Minister of the first normal government. As authorized by the King, the Regency Council has thus accepted the Tito's nomination on 29 November 1945 when FNRY was declared. By this unconditional transfer of powers, King Peter II had abdicated to Tito. This date, when the second Yugoslavia was born under international law, had since been marked as Yugoslavia's national holiday Day of the Republic, however following the communists' switch to totalitarianism, <b>this</b> <b>holiday</b> officially marked the 1943 Session of AVNOJ that coincidentally fell {{on the same day}} of the year.|$|E
