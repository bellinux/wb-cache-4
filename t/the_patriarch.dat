5|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> in García Márquez's The Autumn of <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch,</b> Bolívar was an {{absolute}} dictator. <b>The</b> <b>Patriarch</b> is never identified by name; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buendía in One Hundred Years of Solitude: both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in One Hundred Years of Solitude and Santiago Nasar in Chronicle of a Death Foretold.|$|E

40|$|Usually, {{the primary}} texts on <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> of <b>the</b> Old Testament are {{considered}} to be those in Genesis, not only as to the extent of the material offered, but also regarding the dating accorded <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> in relation to the texts concerned. References to <b>the</b> Old Testament <b>patriarchs</b> in <b>the</b> prophetic texts are often considered to be on the margins. In this article, this ‘exile’ is reversed, {{at least as far as}} the dating of <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> in relation to textual references to them are concerned. Repatriating the importance of the earliest prophetic mention of <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> makes possible new insights into where <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> could most plausibly fit into the religious history of ancient Israel...|$|R

5|$|Once {{back in the}} city, however, <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> and Apokaukos seized power.

5|$|At this point, again {{according}} to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon, who found him and delivered an offer by <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> of Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in the Taurus Mountains or in the Tauric peninsula, i.e. the Crimea). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon (ca. 1375). At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> of Constantinople Philotheos I Kokkinos heard about his dealings in the east, and at Trebizond Paul was met by a messenger from <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond {{had already}} been on bad terms with Peter of Angoulême, Latin Patriarch of Antioch. Taking {{advantage}} of a conflict between <b>the</b> <b>patriarch</b> and the papal legate, Peter Capuano, Bohemond restored the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, Symeon II, in early 1206 or 1207. Peter of Angoulême and the papal legate were reconciled and <b>the</b> <b>patriarch</b> excommunicated Bohemond, Symeon and the commune {{with the approval of}} the Holy See. He also imposed an interdict on Antioch, but the burghers ignored his decision and visited the Greek churches.|$|E

Georgije had originally approached the artist Uroš Predić, but Predić said it would take him two years to complete the painting. Jovanović assured <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> that he could finish the work in eight months. The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition, the other being the Vršac triptych, which was commissioned by the Vršac city council.|$|E

5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.|$|E
5|$|Frederic G. Kenyon {{opposed to}} the Burkit's view and argued that Cyril firmly {{believed}} in the Egyptian origin of the codex. A. S. Fulton, the Keeper of the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts (in British Museum), in 1938 re-examined the Athanasius note, and gave it as his opinion that on palaeographical grounds it could be dated 13th to 14th century and that the 17th century was excluded. In 1945 T. D. Moschonas published a catalogue of the library of <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> of Alexandria, in which he printed two Greek notes, both from 10th-century manuscripts of John Chrysostom, inserted by <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> Athanasius III. The two notes must have been written between 1308 and 1316. Although the note in the Codex Alexandrinus is entirely in Arabic, and therefore no identity of hand the Greek notes can be expected, the similarity of wording leaves no doubt that this also {{is the work of}} Athanasius III.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>patriarchs,</b> or ancestors, are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, {{with their}} wives (Joseph is {{normally}} excluded). Since the name YHWH had not been revealed to them, they worshipped El in his various manifestations. (It is, however, worth noting that in the Jahwist source <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> refer to deity by the name YHWH, for example in Genesis 15.) Through <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> God announces <b>the</b> election of Israel, meaning that he has chosen Israel to be his special people and committed himself to their future. God tells <b>the</b> <b>patriarchs</b> {{that he will be}} faithful to their descendants (i.e. to Israel), and Israel is expected to have faith in God and his promise. ("Faith" [...] in the context of Genesis and the Hebrew bible means agreement to the promissory relationship, not a body of belief).|$|R

5|$|It was prophesied to <b>the</b> <b>patriarch</b> Abraham that {{he would}} have a son and that his name should be Isaac. When Abraham became one hundred years old, this son was born to him by his first wife Sarah. Though this was Abraham's second son it was Sarah's first and only child.|$|E
5|$|According to Byzantine custom, the {{coronation}} of an emperor could only {{take place in}} Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin hands, and <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> (now Germanus II, 1223–40) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the Metropolitan of Thessalonica, Constantine Mesopotamites, whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized <b>the</b> <b>Patriarch</b> at Nicaea as legitimate, and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, he preferred to return to exile. In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at Arta, chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, and declared that the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform {{the coronation}} instead.|$|E
