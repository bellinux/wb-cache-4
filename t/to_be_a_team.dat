5|$|Calgary {{had been}} served for 30 {{years by the}} Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total {{capacity}} of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> selected to merge with the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Though often {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> {{with a strong}} classics pedigree, and active in most races with several top tens, they did not win any single-day race in the spring season. Greg Van Avermaet won the late-season Paris–Tours, along with two stages in stage races earlier in the season. The team's ostensible classics leader, Italian Alessandro Ballan, did not win any race in 2011 and was again briefly suspended from racing pursuant to the ongoing Mantova doping investigation, {{as he had been}} in 2010.|$|E

25|$|After {{becoming}} a permanent fixture as the Phillies' second baseman, Utley demonstrated versatility, {{spending some time}} at first base as well. As his fielding has improved over his career, Utley was seen in combination with Jimmy Rollins {{as one of the}} best middle-infield combinations in the NL, until Rollins was traded to the Dodgers in the winter of 2014. Utley was considered by fans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> leader of the Phillies, alongside Rollins and Ryan Howard, and he has been noted for his leadership qualities with the Dodgers. Utley was known for his quiet understated demeanor, instead setting an example for teammates with his exhaustive preparation in the video room and the batting cage. Utley's seven career World Series home runs are the most for a second baseman, and he shares the single-series postseason record of five home runs with Reggie Jackson and George Springer. He is also noteworthy for having participated in seven no-hitters, of which he was on the winning side in four.|$|E

A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny. It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are." [...] Michele {{described}} the first thirteen episodes of the series as [...] "Rachel's journey of finding herself within the Glee club", and said that [...] "she's learning how <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> player and work within this group. She's a very strong, driven girl, who's sometimes a little misunderstood." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{predominantly}} a striker, Samaras {{can also}} {{play as a}} left midfielder. During his time at Manchester City, Samaras expressed his disappointment at being used on the left of midfield too often, he publicly said to manager Sven-Göran Eriksson; [...] "I am not a left-midfielder, I am a striker and I like to play there," [...] However, after his move to Celtic, Samaras was more open to playing as a left midfielder. The Daily Mail {{said that this was}} because he was happier at Celtic and more willing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> player. In addition to being able to play as a target man, Samaras can also be used in several different roles when playing up front. His natural style of play is to drift off the front line and provide a link between the attack and midfield. In doing this he can use his pace and skill to run at the defence, while also creating chances or opening up space for his teammates. He can also run beyond the centre-backs and his pace means he can run on to through balls hit over the defence.|$|E
50|$|After they {{achieved}} only 12th {{place in}} 2005-06 Iran Pro League, Esteghlal Ahvaz finished as runners-up in the 2006-07 season. They continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> average <b>team</b> in seasons 2007-08 and 2008-09.|$|R

500|$|An own goal {{scored by}} Touré meant Fredrik Ljungberg's opener against Aston Villa was {{cancelled}} {{out and the}} match ended in a draw, albeit helping Arsenal back to first position on goal difference. Leading up to the potential championship decider against Manchester United on 16 April 2003, Wenger was adamant his team were mentally ready to retain the title: [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> who makes history. That's what's really driving us on. We are not worrying about United too much. We are just concentrating on expressing our togetherness, our mental strength and our qualities. We have enough players who can win this game." [...] Having conceded a first half goal scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arsenal overturned Manchester United's lead before Ryan Giggs equalised for the away team. The match ended 2–2; Campbell was sent off for elbowing Ole Gunnar Solskjær and was banned {{the rest of the}} season, whereas Vieira limped off with an injury. Although the result helped Manchester United move back top, they had played one game more than Arsenal. Arsenal won their next match at Middlesbrough, but squandered a two-goal lead away to Bolton Wanderers in the last ten minutes. The result, [...] "a big blow" [...] for Arsenal's title hopes, meant the championship was now in Manchester United's favour.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover was}} {{unveiled}} on July 8, 2010 {{and met with}} positive reception. 'Idolator' said [...] "Ciara has been tempting us with her sexy new single 'Ride' ... but if you're looking for her goodies keep on looking because their [...] not on her Basic Instinct album cover (unless it's a seductive Playboy-esque fold out). The songstress, whose music video proved to be too hot for BET, kept things simple for the cover art." [...] Ciara then outlined plans for a mixtape to precede the album's release, in preparation she recorded remixes to Soulja Boy Tell 'Em's [...] "Pretty Boy Swag" [...] ("Pretty Girl Swag") and Waka Flocka Flame's [...] "Hard in Da Paint", {{as well as a}} cover of Young Jeezy's [...] "Lose My Mind". When asked by Gerrick D. Kennedy. from the Los Angeles Times, if the label [...] {{had anything to do with}} the delays in release or late promotion, Ciara replied [...] "I did see a few comments and I said, 'You know what? I one day look forward to being able to share with my fans (things that happen).' Right now, this is about living in a world of possibility and doing my best, [...]. Getting the record out there, I just want my fans to hear it. This album is really for my fans, and it's good to know the energy and the feedback has been great. It really is just the beginning". In February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, Ciara released an official statement to her Facebook page. Amongst her complaints, were a lack of funding and support from the label with regards to promoting Basic Instinct. In addition to disagreeing with the label over single choices, Ciara personally funded the $100,000 video for her third single [...] "Gimmie Dat". [...] "I'm dedicated to my music, performance and to my fans! I've tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> player with the label only to have compromised what I truly believed.. And was not given the right opportunity to promote and inform my fans of the release of this album." ...|$|E
