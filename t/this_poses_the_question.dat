However, a recent study using a high-sensitivity Western blotting technique revealed low levels of PrPSc in skeletal muscle from a quarter of Swiss patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD). <b>This</b> <b>posed</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether PrPSc in muscle could also be detected in vCJD, sCJD, and iatrogenic (iCJD) patients from other populations. Therefore, we have used the same high-sensitivity Western blotting technique, in combination with paraffin-embedded tissue blotting, to screen for PrPSc in muscle tissue specimens taken at autopsy from 49 CJD patients in the United Kingdom. These techniques identified muscle PrPSc in 8 of 17 vCJD, 7 of 26 sCJD, and 2 of 5 iCJD patients. Paraffin-embedded tissue blotting analysis showed PrPSc in skeletal muscle in localized anatomical structures that had the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of nerve fibers. The detection of PrPSc in muscle tissue from all forms of CJD indicates the possible presence of infectivity in these tissues, suggesting important implications for assessing the potential risk of iatrogenic spread via contaminated surgical instruments...|$|R

5000|$|The Trench is {{described}} as a [...] "confirmation of what an extraordinary and powerful painter Orozco would turn out to be" [...] and is compared to the mural The Farewell, [...] "where the initial impression is of a bloody action scene of great melodrama." [...] He uses jarring muted tones of a darker palette, which matches the dark theme portrayed. Orozco promotes a dignified view of death, as the viewer sees three men sacrificing themselves. Two of the men appear to have died, even though no wounds are present on their bodies, and a third is kneeling while covering his face with his left arm. [...] Their faces are hidden, which gives the viewer a sense of anonymity behind the sacrifice of the many victims of the revolution. <b>This</b> <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> is the sacrifice of many worth anything? It makes their anonymous identity more powerful than if they had recognizable identities, because they now represent the sacrifice of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} men who fought and died for the same reason. [...] There is also a component of Christian iconography in this mural, as the central man leans spread eagle against a barricade of rocks and beams that resemble a cross, which contributes to the mural's balance but not in a symmetrical way. This is an allusion to the crucifix, with the central soldier playing the role of the martyr, which is further exemplified by his lack weapons.

50|$|The {{process begins}} when surface water nucleates around {{irregularities}} where it meets the container wall and freezes inward. If the c-axis {{of the first}} crystal to form is not vertical, the basal plane intersects the surface along a line perpendicular to the c-axis and ice needles tend to propagate across the surface along this line. At {{the same time a}} curtain of ice grows down into the supercooled water along the basal plane. As the film of ice grows to cover most of the surface the crystals merge and become fixed rigidly in place and the sheet of ice continues freezing towards the middle until only a small hole remains unfrozen. The crystallite curtains tend to join at an angle of 60 degrees and so the hole is often triangular, although other geometric shapes are possible. The continuing expansion of the ice downwards into the water then squeezes the remaining water up through the hole and a convex meniscus is formed which bulges slightly higher than the surface of the ice. As the edges of the meniscus freeze they create a small dam which causes the water to rise higher and as it expands above the ice dam the edges freeze again to form another dam on top of the first one. If the rate of expansion of the water {{is the same as the}} rate of freezing at the lip of the hole then this process is continually repeated and successive layers form a tube of ice. The growth of the tube continues in this way until the tip seals over or until all the water is frozen. The formation of ice spikes is related to the shape of the water body, the concentration of dissolved impurities, air temperature and air circulation above the water. Spikes that grow from a crystallite formed below the surface of the water may project from the ice sheet at a steep angle, rather than perpendicular to it.Small ice spikes can be formed artificially on ice cubes produced in domestic refrigerators using distilled water in plastic ice cube trays. The formation of the spike is similar to that of the naturally occurring spike in that the expansion of interior water and the reduction of volume in the interior of the cube increase the pressure on the water pushing it upward through the hole. The growth of the tube ceases when the drop at the top of the tube freezes entirely, which is substantially before the rest of the water in the cube is frozen. This method produces small spikes which are usually round or triangular in cross section with sharp tips. Experiments using this method have been carried out in laboratory settings but it has been found that spikes are less likely to form in ice cubes made from non-distilled water as impurities in the water inhibit spike formation. <b>This</b> <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how naturally occurring ice spikes form in tapwater or rainwater and Libbrecht and Lui have suggested that, in the case of the small spikes grown in a refrigerator, impurities will become increasingly concentrated in the small unfrozen droplet at the top of the tube reducing the freezing rate and so the growth of the tube. However, they believe that on the rare occasions when exceptionally large spikes grow in natural, outdoor ice formations, some other mechanism must remove the impurities that build up at the top of the growing tube. Either impurities may be forced into pockets that freeze more slowly, or perhaps a convective flow, which would be insignificant in the smaller, artificially grown spikes, replaces the water at the top of the tube with fresh water from below.|$|E
