5|$|Since many {{substrates}} are not stable to sodium hydride, several {{procedures have}} been developed using milder bases. Masamune and Roush have developed mild conditions using lithium chloride and DBU. Rathke extended this to lithium or magnesium halides with <b>triethylamine.</b> Several other bases have been found effective.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and <b>triethylamine.</b> Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% <b>triethylamine</b> in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E
25|$|In {{synthetic}} organic chemistry, {{formic acid}} {{is often used}} {{as a source of}} hydride ion. The Eschweiler-Clarke reaction and the Leuckart-Wallach reaction are examples of this application. It, or more commonly its azeotrope with <b>triethylamine,</b> is also used as a source of hydrogen in transfer hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} proton sponges {{are known}} with even higher basicity. 1,8-bis(hexamethyltriaminophosphazenyl)naphthalene or HMPN is prepared from 1,8-diaminonaphthalene by reaction with tris(dimethylamino)bromophosphonium bromide {{in the presence}} of <b>triethylamine.</b> HMPN has a pKBH+ of 29.9 in acetonitrile which is more than 11 orders of magnitude higher than Proton Sponge.|$|E
25|$|The Corey–Kim {{oxidation}} was a {{newly developed}} transformation for {{the conversion of}} alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones. This process offers a less toxic alternative to chromium based oxidations {{with the use of}} N-chlorosuccinimidosulfonium chloride (NCS), dimethylsulfide (DMS), and <b>triethylamine</b> (TEA). The Corey-Kim reagent is formed in situ when NCS and DMS are reacted to form dimethylsuccinimidosulfonium chloride species (scheme 14).|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is {{performed in the}} presence of an organopalladium catalyst. The halide (Br, Cl) or triflate is an aryl, benzyl, or vinyl compound and the alkene contains at least one hydrogen and is often electron-deficient such as acrylate ester or an acrylonitrile.The catalyst can be tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), palladium chloride or palladium(II) acetate. The ligand is triphenylphosphine, PHOX or BINAP. The base is <b>triethylamine,</b> potassium carbonate or sodium acetate.|$|E
25|$|The alkoxy sulfonium salt is {{deprotonated}} at {{the alpha}} position with <b>triethylamine</b> {{to afford the}} oxidized product. The reaction accommodates {{a wide array of}} functional groups, but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides. Its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility. In the total synthesis of ingenol, Kuwajima and co-workers exploited the Corey-Kim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcohol(scheme 15).|$|E
25|$|Unlike Western designs, the R-21 used a cold launch {{solid rocket}} to eject the missile from the flooded launch tube before the main motor ignited. This allowed {{missiles}} {{to be launched}} in a water depth of 40-60m. The propulsion system used an IRFNA-amine fuel, AK-27I/TG-02. AK-27I {{was a mixture of}} 73% nitric acid, 27% nitrogen tetroxide, and an iodine passivant. The fuel was originally used in the Wasserfall rocket under the name TONKA-250 and consisted of 50% <b>triethylamine</b> and 50% xylidine. This gave the R-21 a range of , double that of first-generation sub-launched missiles. The Naval Institute Guide suggests that the range was initially 1300km, and extended to 1650km later {{in the life of the}} missile. There was a single warhead of approximately 800 kilotons.|$|E
