5|$|The Bronze Age– {{defined by}} the use of metal– began around 2500 BC, with {{technology}} changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel; harnessing oxen; weaving textiles; brewing alcohol; and skilful metalworking, which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.|$|E

25|$|The third {{scene of}} Act IV, Terakoya ("Temple School") {{is among the}} most popular, and most {{frequently}} performed, scenes in the play. It takes place at the provincial school run by Genzō and Tonami, where they are watching over the young Kan Shūsai. Shihei suspects <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the minister's son is being hidden, and sends Matsuōmaru there to kill the boy and return with his head; among all of Shihei's retainers, only Matsuōmaru is trusted to identify the boy's head. In this scene, Matsuōmaru is dressed in a dark kimono with snow and pine motifs, his hair wild and busy, a sign of the tragedy which is to come, and of the illness which he claims in order to quit Shihei's service.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger’s work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make sense of their feelings by seeing “them as embodying a judgment about the object they bear on: ‘To experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating” (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are “affective modes of awareness” (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream cognitive approaches which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a linear mode of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don’t necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the world around him, they also show what is important to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor’s theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and what is important to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> it rightfully belongs.|$|E

500|$|The {{expedition}} {{consisted of}} two frigates, Recherche and Espérance. The first landfall was the Canary Islands, then the Cape of Good Hope followed by Van Diemen’s Land (in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, named by d'Entrecasteaux after the flagship of his expedition [...] ), then New Caledonia, Admiralty Islands, the Dutch colony of Ambon (where Delahaye exchanged seeds with the Dutch governor) then to south-western Australia discovering and naming Esperance Bay (d'Entrecasteaux now commemorating his second ship). With water running low the ships {{then returned to the}} safety of Recherche Bay, thus completing a counterclockwise circumnavigation of the continent. The next destination was Tonga where Delahaye collected breadfruit for transport to the Isle de France (now Mauritius), then to New Caledonia (where Kermadec, captain of the Espérance died), past Vanikoro Island (unaware <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> La Pérouse had been shipwrecked) then through the Solomons, Trobriand Islands and finally, just before the death of d’Entrecasteaux in July 1793 from scurvy, surveyed the coasts of eastern New Guinea and northern New Britain. The expedition was now under the new command of d’Auribeau the ships arriving at Sourabaya, Java, in 1793, to be told that France was now at war with European countries including Holland, Britain and Spain, also that Louis XVI had been guillotined and a French republic was now declared. The Dutch seized the ships. With one exception all the savants appeared to have revolutionary sympathies. They were interned at Semerang and the scientific collections confiscated to be eventually captured later by the British from a French ship returning them to France. Under the benign auspices of Joseph Banks, these were returned to France. Delahaye was not, like Labillardiere, interned at Semerang but was permitted to tend the breadfruit trees destined for the Isle de France. In the course of the expedition, and under the guidance of Labillardière, Delahaye had made a numbered collection of 2,699 dried plant specimens as well as many collections of seed.|$|E
500|$|Reception of [...] "Not Afraid" [...] {{was mixed}} to positive. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone praised the song's tone: [...] "Over a dark, operatic beat. Eminem {{delivers}} rhymes that are typically acrobatic—and typically heavy-handed. But the anger has a gathering quality." [...] Dolan also praised the song's inspirational theme. Henry Adaso of About.com gave a positive review on the song, noting [...] "Boi-1da's bouncy charm" [...] and [...] "heartwrenching lyrics from a master poet" [...] as good {{aspects of the}} song and noted no negative aspects. In Adaso's guide review, he praised Boi-1da's production and Eminem's affecting lyrics; he considered the former's work [...] "shimmering" [...] and Eminem's [...] "sensitive lyrics entwine on this knocker"; overall, he gave the song {{four and a half}} stars out of a possible five. After the song's release, AllHipHop called it [...] "an anthem in nature and rebellious to the core." [...] In her review of the Recovery, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone noted that even if Eminem—reaching his late 30s—is becoming [...] "a grumpy middle-aged man, at least he's owning it". Winston Robbins of music website Consequence of Sound called [...] "Not Afraid" [...] one of the songs on Recovery [...] "with catchy hooks, choruses, and beats multiplied by the endless pool of wit and anger that Eminem possesses". In his album review, Thomas Nassiff wrote on behalf of AbsolutePunk; he noted the song for being radio-friendly and that it [...] "doesn't sacrifice anything to be friendly to the masses."

2500|$|For {{a number}} of years during the late 1980s and 90s there have been rumors of a hentai version of Hikari no Densetsu.

However, there is an anime series that has parodied the Hikari no Densetsu series in the past (It is believed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the rumors have come from). The anime series was parodied by Cream Lemon, an anthology OVA series from the mid and late 80s which is known for its emphasis on the story and its plot. In the second installment of the OVA series, the second episode called [...] "White Shadow", it tells the story of an aspiring gymnast that resembles the character the anime character Hikari in design. The episode also contains two male characters that resemble Mao and Takaaki. This episode was mostly ignored by fans of the manga and anime series as a parody due to its lack of reference of the series and its poor quality, texture and design. The episode was released in the United States by Excalibur Films on both VHS and DVD with the alternate name [...] "Black Widow" [...] with other episodes of the Cream lemon series as part of a trilogy titled: [...] "Pandora An Erotic Trilogy - Brothers Grime Adult Cartoon Volume 3."
