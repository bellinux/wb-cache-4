25|$|In 1859, one of Roach's closest friends, {{a lawyer}} named John Baker, died and left Roach the trustee of his estate. The estate, worth $70,000, was {{entrusted}} to Roach for investment until Baker's four children came of age. Since the money {{could not be}} claimed until 1881, it {{was as good as}} a long-term interest-free loan to Roach, who was soon to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to expand his business.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the failure}} of Johnson's assault, Hood decided to end {{offensive}} actions for the evening and began to plan for a resumed series of attacks in the morning.

The Union army began entering the breastworks at Nashville at noon on December 1, with Hood's damaged army in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 23, Warren and Hancock {{approached}} the North Anna. There were no significant fortifications to their front. Lee had misjudged Grant's plan, assuming any advance against the North Anna would be a mere diversion, while {{the main body of}} Grant's army continued its flanking march to the east. At the Chesterfield Bridge crossing the Telegraph Road, a small South Carolina brigade under Col. John W. Henagan had created a dirt redoubt, and there was a small party guarding the railroad bridge downstream, but all the other river crossings were left undefended. Grant had been presented with a golden opportunity if he moved quickly enough to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|His friend Tina Strobos was not Jewish {{and thus}} {{was free of}} {{restrictions}} and threat of incarceration. She arranged hiding places for Pais and other Jews in Amsterdam. When the Germans began forcing the Dutch Jews into a ghetto in the old Jewish quarter of Amsterdam, his sister Annie and her husband Hermann complied. Tina found them a place to hide, but despite Pais's urgent pleas for them to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> they {{did not think it}} necessary. Annie was later killed at the Sobibór extermination camp. Tina had found refuge for Pais's parents on a farm outside Amsterdam where they survived the war. She also acted as a courier between Pais and his parents during the war, though neither knew of the other's specific location.|$|E

25|$|Judicial {{review is}} {{available}} {{as a means of}} challenging the legality of decisions of all governmental authorities, though it is regarded as a procedure of last resort that should be used only where the individual has no alternative remedy such as a right of appeal. If a right of appeal exists, it is more favourable for a person to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as the appellate court may substitute its decision for that of the original authority and grant a remedy. An appeal may also involve a reconsideration of the merits of the case and not merely its legality, although this depends on the wording of the statute in question. On the other hand, when exercising judicial review, the High Court is almost always limited to examining whether public authorities have acted lawfully, and do not evaluate the substantive merits of decisions taken.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the failure}} of Johnson's assault, Hood decided to end {{offensive}} actions for the evening and began to plan for a resumed series of attacks in the morning. Schofield ordered his infantry to cross the river, starting at 11 p.m., despite objections from Cox that withdrawal was no longer necessary and that Hood was weakened and should be counter-attacked. Schofield had received orders from Thomas to evacuate earlier that day—before Hood's attack began—and {{he was happy to}} take advantage of them despite the changed circumstances. Although there was a period in which the Union army was vulnerable, outside its works and straddling the river, Hood did not attempt to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> during the night.

25|$|On 8 September, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies. This began a race to disarm and intern the Italian garrisons of the Balkans before the Allies could <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Lanz was tasked with overcoming the Italian forces in Epirus and the Ionian Islands. In two cases, in Cephalonia and Corfu, the Italians offered resistance. Lanz himself was initially in favour of negotiating the Italian surrender, {{but in the end}} followed his orders and stormed these islands. In Cephalonia, the battle raged for a week before the Italians surrendered. After their surrender, and according to a directive from Hitler himself, more than 5,000 Italians were executed by the Germans. Lanz was present in Cephalonia both during the battle and the subsequent massacre. In Corfu, resistance lasted only for a day, but all 280 Italian officers on the island were shot and their bodies were disposed of in the sea, on Lanz's orders.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 23, Warren reached Mount Carmel Church and paused for instructions. Hancock's corps came up from behind and the two units got hopelessly mixed up on the road. The corps commanders decided that Hancock would {{continue}} along the Telegraph Road to Chesterfield Bridge while Warren would cross the North Anna upstream at Jericho Mills. There were no significant fortifications to their front. Lee had misjudged Grant's plan, assuming that any advance against the North Anna would be a mere diversion, while {{the main body of}} Grant's army continued its flanking march to the east. At the Chesterfield Bridge crossing the Telegraph Road, a small South Carolina brigade under Col. John W.

25|$|Matt Kenseth {{started on}} pole, but {{gave way to}} Brad Keselowski, who started on the front row and had the fastest car at the beginning. After he led 38 laps. Jimmie Johnson would take over the lead, leading 104 of the race's 200 laps. Many {{cautions}} waved during the race because of drivers repeatedly cutting down left side tires. Kenseth had the first pit box and would <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> a few times, {{coming out in the}} lead. Kenseth would lead three or four laps after the restarts, then Johnson would pass him as Kenseth's car faded back. With seven laps remaining, Johnson had a left-front tire go down, giving the lead to his teammate Jeff Gordon. Keselowski suffered his third left-rear tire failure a lap later but stayed out of harm’s way. The same fate befell Marcos Ambrose on the same lap. Gordon, who had a large lead, slowed his pace and almost made it to the finish, but Clint Bowyer spun with a lap and a half to go, thanks to a flat left-rear tire. The caution waved to set up the green-white-checker finish. On the restart, Gordon got shuffled back to finish in 13th. Kyle Busch passed Tony Stewart and Kurt Busch (both of whom only took two tires during pit stops), bringing rookie Kyle Larson with him. Kyle Busch held off Larson to win his first race of the year. Larson finished second and Kurt Busch finished third. Kenseth also passed Stewart on the last lap to finish in fourth. Stewart came home fifth.|$|E

It begins raining, and Elle decides to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> She releases an electrical charge, which travels through the water {{on the ground and}} into Claude, but she, too, is knocked unconscious in the process. Claude and his friends, Abigail and Lee, carry her to his place and he begins to show Elle the source of her problem. Things get ugly when Elle accidentally shocks Abigail, which leads them to fight each other; Abigail's force field redirects Elle's lightning towards Lee, so Elle stops and then is asked to leave the place. Although Claude asks her to stay, she prefers to look for the help of Noah, so she goes to Costa Verde and attacks Lyle while waiting for his father.|$|E

Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it.
