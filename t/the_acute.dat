5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop during <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> phase, {{they usually}} resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called determinate chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> {{phase of}} an attack, {{administration}} of potassium will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised {{as the total}} amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for potassium levels to overshoot ("rebound hyperkalemia"); slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>acute</b> oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. <b>The</b> <b>acute</b> toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> and chronic phases. During <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of {{the immune system}} to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E

5|$|Antiparasitic {{treatment}} {{is most effective}} early {{in the course of}} infection, but is not limited to cases in <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> phase. Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox. Both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate T. cruzi from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E

5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During <b>the</b> <b>acute</b> phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. <b>The</b> <b>acute</b> effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E

Yet he accounted Cesare Borgia--as we shall see--the incarnation of an ideal conqueror and ruler; he took Cesare Borgia as the model for his famous work The Prince, written as a grammar of statecraft for the instruction in the art of government of that weakling Giuliano de'Medici.|$|R
