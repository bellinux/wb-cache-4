25|$|QUINN <b>Therm,</b> at Scotchtown, Ballyconnell, County Cavan was {{commissioned}} in October 2004 {{to produce and}} distribute rigid polyurethane thermal insulation products for the Irish and UK markets. Aventas <b>Therm</b> produces rigid foam board for cavity wall insulation. QUINN Tarmac was established in 1994 to produce a range of blacktop products. Aventas Cement has been in production since 1989 at its Derrylin site using local raw material from the quarry facilities. Because of increasing demand from the construction sector, a second plant {{was commissioned}} in 2000 {{in the northern part}} of the Republic of Ireland, outside the small town of Ballyconnell and close to the Northern Ireland border.|$|E
25|$|The boiseries, still often dated in the mid-1760s, were {{discussed}} in the issue of L'Avant-coureur for 21 January 1761, and so must {{have been carried out}} about 1758-59 (Eriksen 1974:298 and pl. 35). The Hôtel in the Marais district remodelled for Claude-Charles-Dominique Tourolle survives (the rue d'Orléans is now the rue Charlot) but the salon's boiseries and chimneypieces were removed in the mid-nineteenth century to a house in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré now in the possession of the Cercle Interallié. Round-arched mirrors over the chimneypieces and centering the long wall in a shallow recess are disposed in a system of stop-fluted Ionic pilasters. White marble draped caryatid <b>therm</b> figures support the chimneypiece's tablette. There is a full architrave under a dentilled cornice. The white-and-gold ensemble would still have been fully in style in 1790.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{retail sales}} {{are often in}} units of therms (th); 1 <b>therm</b> = 100,000BTU. Gas meters measure the volume of gas used, and this is {{converted}} to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. Wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms (Dth), or in thousand decatherms (MDth), or in million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas. [...] Gas sales to domestic consumers may be in units of 100 standard cubic feet (scf). The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one RCE.|$|E
