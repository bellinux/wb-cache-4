5|$|A {{connection}} between the IND Queens Boulevard Line at Queens Plaza to the BMT 60th Street Tunnel that would increase capacity between Queens and Manhattan by 20 tph. <b>This</b> <b>connection</b> would permit the full use of {{the capacity of the}} Queens Boulevard local tracks.|$|E
5|$|And {{although}} it is a literary anachronism to connect Virgil to Erichtho, given that Lucan—the one who popularized Erichtho in literature—was born around fifty years {{after the death of}} Virgil, <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> successfully plays upon the popular Medieval belief that Virgil himself was a magician and prophet.|$|E
5|$|Phases 3 and 4 {{will extend}} the line south from 63rd Street to Houston Street and Hanover Square, respectively. As part of Phase 3, a {{connection}} to the IND 63rd Street Line would be built, allowing for non-revenue moves into Queens. <b>This</b> <b>connection</b> will be constructed through underground drilling and blasting. Bellmouths already exist for <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> east of the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. This section, {{like the rest of the}} line, will mainly consist of a two-track line. However, between 21st Street and 9th Street, two additional tracks will be constructed on either side of the main alignment to allow for the storage of eight trains. This location was selected due to the sufficient depth of the area.|$|E

5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, {{they should not be}} treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of <b>this</b> <b>connection,</b> religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In <b>this</b> <b>connection,</b> Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
5|$|In other Jain texts, Krishna is stated to be {{a cousin}} of the twenty-second Tirthankara, Neminatha. The Jain texts state that Naminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. According to Jeffery D. Long, a {{professor}} of religion known for his publications on Jainism, <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.|$|E
5|$|In the High Middle Ages senior clergymen {{had their}} London palaces in the street. Place-names {{surviving}} with <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> are Peterborough Court and Salisbury Court after their respective Bishops' houses here; {{apart from the}} Knights Templars' establishment the Whitefriars monastery is recalled by Whitefriars Street {{and the remains of}} its undercroft have been preserved in a public display area. A Carmelite church was established on Fleet Street in 1253, but it was destroyed during the Reformation in 1545.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, SS7 links {{normally}} {{are directly}} connected between switching exchanges using F-links. <b>This</b> direct <b>connection</b> is called associated signaling. In North America, SS7 links are normally indirectly connected between switching exchanges using an intervening network of STPs. <b>This</b> indirect <b>connection</b> is called quasi-associated signaling, which reduces {{the number of}} SS7 links necessary to interconnect all switching exchanges and SCPs in an SS7 signaling network.|$|R

5|$|One of Siward's sons {{is known}} to have survived him, Waltheof, whose mother was Ælfflæd. Waltheof later rose to be an earl in the East Midlands before {{becoming}} Earl of Northumbria. When Waltheof rebelled against William the Conqueror, however, the act led to his execution and to his subsequent veneration as a saint at Crowland Abbey. Waltheof's daughter married David I, King of the Scots, and through <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> Siward became one of the many ancestors of the later Scottish and British monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Readville has {{an unusual}} layout {{because it is}} built on the {{crossing}} of two rail lines. The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line each have a single track atop an embankment. The Fairmount Line has a single side platform, while the Franklin Line has two. The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor to join with the Franklin Line. <b>This</b> <b>connection</b> is used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor.|$|E

Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of racism and homophobia while others have denied <b>this</b> <b>connection.</b> Disco Demolition Night remains well {{known as one of}} the most extreme promotions in major league history.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E

5|$|Bellingham was immortalized as {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as {{the brother of}} Ann Hibbins, {{a woman who was}} executed (in real life in 1656, {{as well as in the}} book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> appears to be based on a footnote in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, a paved county road {{connected}} Vallejo and Benicia {{north of}} the Carquinez Strait, following the present Maine Street, Benicia Road, Columbus Parkway, and K Street. Although state highways were designated to Benicia in 1910 (Legislative Route (LRN) 7, now I-680) and Vallejo in 1931 (LRN 74, now SR 29), <b>this</b> <b>connection</b> was not added until 1935, when LRN 74 (an unsigned designation) was extended east from Vallejo to Benicia and north along former Route 7 to Fairfield. (A short spur connecting Vallejo to the Carquinez Bridge was added to Route 74 in 1937.) LRN 74 initially entered Benicia on K Street and left on East Fifth Street, making several turns in between. Two realignments {{were built in the}} 1940s, reducing the number of turns to one, at the corner of L and East Second Streets.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte's Way, {{formerly}} known as Hill House, {{is located in a}} prominent setting close to Saint Paul's Church of Ireland church. This house was once the home of Charlotte Brontë's husband, Mr. Nicholls, who returned to Banagher after Charlotte's death. Nicholls remarried and lived at Hill House until his death in 1906. The house was sold to a Major Bell in 1919. He died in 1944 and his wife inherited the property. Florence Bell died in 1959. <b>This</b> <b>connection</b> to Brontë, one of the most renowned writers of the 19th century, is revealed in its present name, giving the house cultural interest. It is a detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1753, with a gabled central bay to the façade with modern porch and single-bay two-storey wing to the south and two-bay two-storey wing to the north. It is now used as a bed and breakfast and visitors can enjoy its restored appearance and sense the history of a place connected in a curious way with the Brontë family.|$|E
