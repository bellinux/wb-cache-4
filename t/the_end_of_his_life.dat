5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date {{may well be}} too late for man who was an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up at about the same time. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> {{it is also possible that}} Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E
