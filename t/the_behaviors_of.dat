5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E

25|$|In {{the branch}} of physics called {{statistical}} mechanics, entropy {{is a measure of}} the randomness or disorder of a physical system. This concept was studied in the 1870s by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who showed that the thermodynamic properties of a gas could be derived from the combined properties of its many constituent molecules. Boltzmann argued that by averaging <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> all the different molecules in a gas, one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume, temperature, and pressure. In addition, this perspective led him to give a precise definition of entropy as the natural logarithm of the number of different states of the molecules (also called microstates) that give rise to the same macroscopic features.|$|E
25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|Galápagos green turtles {{have been}} {{recorded}} and observed in the Galápagos {{as far back as}} the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much attention has been paid to them due to the overwhelming research done on the Galápagos giant tortoises. Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> the Galápagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. It is the only subpopulation of green sea turtle to be given premise for separate species delineation, proposing Chelonia agassizii as a separate species. At this time, no distinctions have been made, mainly due to analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15nesting beaches. This analysis has showed little distinction between the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas.|$|E

Narcissistic {{personality disorder}} is a condition different from self-confidence (a strong sense of self); people with NPD typically value themselves over other persons {{to the extent that}} they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements. Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego (Self-concept), an inability to tolerate criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.|$|E

500|$|The {{pollutant}} methylmercury is a globally distributed neurotoxin and an {{endocrine system}} disruptor. In the Everglades ecosystem, human pollution {{has led to}} increased concentrations of methylmercury, which have impacted <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> the American white ibis. Hormone levels in males are affected, leading to {{a decrease in the}} rates of key courtship behavior, and fewer approaches by females during the mating season. In addition, methylmercury also increased male-male pairing behaviors by 55%. Both the chemically induced [...] "homosexual" [...] behavior and the diminished ability to attract females by males have reduced reproduction rates in affected populations. Exposure of American white ibises to methylmercury causes reduced foraging efficiency and it also makes them more likely to abandon nests owing to the disruptive effect of the pollutant on the bird's hormone systems, which in turn affects parental care behavior. Tests on captive birds have not shown a decreased survival of American white ibis exposed to methylmercury.|$|E

500|$|Desiring a {{realistic}} depiction of vulpine behavior and habits, Mannix {{spent more than}} a year studying <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were [...] "so tame [...] could turn them loose and watch them hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." [...] Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and [...] "Masters of Hounds" [...] to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's postscript, Mannix discusses this research. [...] To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while people have told him that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near Thorndale, Pennsylvania—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{for many}} years the {{predominant}} view of {{the function of the}} nervous system was as a stimulus-response associator. [...] In this conception, neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory neurons, producing signals that propagate through chains of connections in the spinal cord and brain, giving rise eventually to activation of motor neurons and thereby to muscle contraction, i.e., to overt responses. [...] Descartes believed that all of <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> animals, and most of <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> humans, could be explained in terms of stimulus-response circuits, although he also believed that higher cognitive functions such as language were not capable of being explained mechanistically. [...] Charles Sherrington, in his influential 1906 book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System, developed the concept of stimulus-response mechanisms in much more detail, and Behaviorism, the school of thought that dominated Psychology through the middle of the 20th century, attempted to explain every aspect of human behavior in stimulus-response terms.|$|E
