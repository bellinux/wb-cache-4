25|$|OA1 is {{recognized}} by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity {{is accompanied by}} involuntary movements of the eye termed as nystagmus. Astigmatism is a condition wherein there occurs significant refractive error. Moreover, ocular albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or strabismus. Since very little pigment is present the iris becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to blueish red. However, {{the most important part}} of the eye, the fovea which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some affected individuals may also develop photophobia/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to lack of pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an ocular albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow the usual pattern of routing. In an ocular albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye. An ocular albino eye appears blueish pink in color with no pigmentation at all unlike a normal eye. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to X-inactivation and partial iris <b>transillumination</b> and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by those affected by OA1.|$|E

50|$|In 1977, Jöbsis {{reported}} that brain tissue transparency to NIR light allowed a non-invasive and continuous method of tissue oxygen saturation using <b>transillumination</b> in neonates. <b>Transillumination</b> (forward-scattering) was of limited utility in adults because of light attenuation and was quickly replaced by reflectance-mode based techniques.

50|$|Diagnosis may {{be delayed}} {{for several months}} because the infant's early {{behavior}} appears to be relatively normal. <b>Transillumination,</b> an examination in which light is passed through body tissues, {{can be used to}} diagnose hydranencephaly. An accurate, confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth, though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography (ultrasound) can identify characteristic physical abnormalities that exist. Through thorough clinical evaluation, via physical findings, detailed patient history, and advanced imaging techniques, such as angiogram, computerized tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or more rarely <b>transillumination</b> after birth are the most accurate diagnostic techniques. However, diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between severe obstructive hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly, leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis.|$|E

5000|$|In {{medicine}} <b>transillumination</b> generally {{refers to}} the transmission of light through tissues of the body. A common example is the transmission of light through fingers, producing a red glow due to red blood cells absorbing other wavelengths of light.

If the diagnosis is not clinically evident, <b>transillumination</b> (with a penlight against the scrotum) will show a non-translucent fluid inside the scrotum. Ultrasound imaging may also be useful in confirming the diagnosis. In severe or non-resolving cases, surgical incision and drainage may be required.

5000|$|Snowflake had poor vision, {{which is}} {{associated}} with albinism. A test to try to determine whether Snowflake had a central blind spot did not find one. Barcelona Zoo director Antonio Jonch wrote: [...] "The eye had a blueish sclera, a normal cornea, and a light blue iris which was very transparent to <b>transillumination.</b> Accommodation and refraction were normal. The media were transparent and the {{fundus of the eye}} normal and totally depigmented. The choroidal vessels were perfectly visible and the pupil was normal. The animal displayed marked photophobia which caused it to close its eyes repeatedly when exposed to bright light. In diffuse light similar to that in its biotope, we calculated that it blinked on an average of 20 times a minute." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{hydrocele}} {{feels like}} a small fluid-filled balloon inside the scrotum. It is smooth, and is mainly {{in front of the}} testis. Hydroceles vary greatly in size and are typically painless and harmless. However, as the fluid continues to accumulate and the scrotum further enlarges, more discomfort can be expected. Large hydroceles will cause discomfort because of their size. Sometimes pain can be in both testicles as pressure from the enlarged area puts pressure against the unaffected area which can cause discomfort to the normal testicle. It has also been found to decrease a man's sex drive and makes him less active for fear of enlarging the mass. As the fluid of a hydrocele is transparent, light shone through the hydrocelic region will be visible from the other side. This phenomenon is called <b>transillumination.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{swelling}} is {{soft and}} non-tender, large in size on examination, and the testis cannot usually be felt. The presence of fluid is demonstrated by trans illumination. These hydrocoeles can reach a huge size, containing large amount of fluid, as these are painless and are often ignored. They are otherwise asymptomatic, other than size and weight, causing inconvenience. However the long continued presence of large hydroceles causes atrophy of testis due to compression or by obstructing blood supply. In most cases, the hydrocele, when diagnosed early during complete physical examination, are small and the testis can easily be palpated within a lax hydrocele. However Ultrasound imaging is necessary to visualize the testis if the hydrocele sac is dense to reveal the primary abnormality. But these can become large in cases when left unattended. Hydroceles are usually painless, as are testicular tumors. A common method of diagnosing a hydrocele is by attempting to shine a strong light (<b>transillumination)</b> through the enlarged scrotum. A hydrocele will usually pass light, while a tumor will not (except {{in the case of}} a malignancy with reactive hydrocele).|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{there is}} {{a thick layer of}} melanin {{on the back of the}} iris. Even people with the lightest blue eyes, with no melanin on the front of the iris at all, have dark brown {{coloration}} on the back of it, to prevent light from scattering around inside the eye. In those with milder forms of albinism, the color of the iris is typically blue but can vary from blue to brown. In severe forms of albinism, there is no pigment on the back of the iris, and light from inside the eye can pass through the iris to the front. In these cases, the only color seen is the red from the hemoglobin of the blood in the capillaries of the iris. Such albinos have pink eyes, as do albino rabbits, mice, or any other animal with a total lack of melanin. <b>Transillumination</b> defects can almost always be observed during an eye examination due to lack of iridial pigmentation. The ocular albino also lacks normal amounts of melanin in the retina as well, which allows more light than normal to reflect off the retina and out of the eye. Because of this, the pupillary reflex is much more pronounced in albino individuals, and this can emphasize the red eye effect in photographs.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the shear bond strength of brackets bonded with the conventional technique, <b>transillumination</b> technique and the combination of both the techniques; the effect of curing time on the bond strength of the brackets bonded with the <b>transillumination</b> method; and the amount of light passing through different thickness of teeth. Materials and methods: The {{study was conducted}} in vitro on 175 extracted human teeth (50 incisors and 125 premolars). In {{the first part of the}} study, the amount of light passing through different thickness of teeth was studied and, for second part, brackets were bonded with <b>transillumination</b> method and conventional method followed by shear bond strength testing using an instron machine. Results: The amount of light passing through the tooth depends on the thickness of the tooth. Only a small fraction of the original light intensity passes through the tooth but this is adequate to achieve clinically acceptable bond strengths. The bond strength achieved with <b>transillumination</b> method is comparable to the conventional light cure technique. Ten seconds of <b>transillumination</b> followed by conventional curing leads to an increase in bond strength and this increase is clinically significant.

40|$|Hand-held {{near-infrared}} (NIR) optical imagers {{are developed}} by various researchers towards non-invasive clinical breast imaging. Unlike these existing imagers that can perform only reflectance imaging, a generation- 2 (Gen- 2) hand-held optical imager has been recently developed to perform both reflectance and <b>transillumination</b> imaging. The unique forked {{design of the}} hand-held probe head(s) allows for reflectance imaging (as in ultrasound) and <b>transillumination</b> or compressed imaging (as in X-ray mammography). Phantom studies were performed to demonstrate two-dimensional (2 D) target detection via reflectance and <b>transillumination</b> imaging at various target depths (1 – 5 cm deep) and using simultaneous multiple point illumination approach. It was observed that 0. 45 cc targets were detected up to 5 cm deep during <b>transillumination,</b> but limited to 2. 5 cm deep during reflectance imaging. Additionally, implementing appropriate data post-processing techniques along with a polynomial fitting approach, to plot 2 D surface contours of the detected signal, yields distinct target detectability and localization.
