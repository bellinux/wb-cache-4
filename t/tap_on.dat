25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{operating flight}} TP-425 was a Boeing 727-282 Advanced registration CS-TBR {{named after the}} Portuguese aviation pioneer Sacadura Cabral. Its manufacturer serial number was 20972/1096 and was delivered to <b>TAP</b> <b>on</b> 21 January 1975. It was powered by 3 Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17 turbofan engines which had a maximum thrust of 16,000lbf each. The aircraft had completed a B check on 21 September 1977, {{and at the time}} of the accident had accumulated 6,154 flying hours in 5,204 cycles.|$|E

25|$|The one-millionth {{passenger}} flew on <b>TAP</b> <b>on</b> 19 June 1964, 18 {{years after}} the airline began operations. In 1966 TAP operated its first sole flight to Brazil, when a company Boeing 707 landed at Galeão Airport in Rio de Janeiro, on 17 June at 17.32 GMT. Precisely {{at the same time}} and on the same day as the hydroplane Santa Cruz moored in Guanabara Bay in 1922, when Sacadura Cabral and Gago Coutinho made their historic South Atlantic crossing. The route to Brazil was inaugurated.|$|E

25|$|This {{is a rare}} form of synesthesia where {{individuals}} {{feel the}} same sensation that another person feels (such as touch). For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> their own shoulder as well. People {{with this type of}} synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population. This {{may be related to the}} so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{has been}} {{recognised}} that foreign workers are crucial to the country's economy, the government is considering capping these workers, as foreign workers make up 80% of the construction industry and up to 50% of the service industry. To keep an effective <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the issue of immigration and to also attract foreign talents at the same time, the Ministry of Manpower (MoM) issues employment pass under three categories viz: P1 Employment Pass for those individuals with monthly earning of $8,000 and up, P2 Employment Pass for individuals with monthly earning of $4,500–7,999 and Q1 Employment Pass individuals {{with at least a}} monthly earning of $3,000.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E
25|$|As a cost {{reduction}} measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar warm-up time. In one such design, a <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{keyswitch}} orientation on joint torques. Background: The fingertip produces primarily vertical forces during single-finger <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> a computer keyswitch. However, horizontal force components within the sagittal plane of the finger could reduce net joint torques. Method: Eleven participants <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> a keyswitch oriented in three directions: vertical, tilted 30 ° such that when pressed it moved away from the user (similar to a positive-tilt keyboard), and tilted 30 ° such that when pressed it moved toward the user (similar to a negative-tilt keyboard). Participants also <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> a prototype cantilever keyswitch design in which the key cap moves along the arc of a bending beam gradually away from the user. Miniature electro-optical goniometers measured the finger posture, and a two-axis force sensor measured fingertip forces. Results: <b>Tapping</b> <b>on</b> a keyswitch oriented such that it moves away from the user when pressed reduced net joint torques by 47 % relative to <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> a vertically orientated keyswitch and by 56 % relative to <b>tapping</b> <b>on</b> a keyswitch oriented toward the user, whereas the cantilever design resulted in 14 % decreases in net joint torque relative to the vertical orientation. Conclusion: Reductions of torques resulted from decreasing the moment arm of the fingertip force about the joints. Application: Keyboard design should incorporate keyswitch mechanism angles along with other postural and geometric constraints to reduce exposure of the finger joints and muscles to force during typing...|$|R

25|$|Promotion {{of healthy}} sucking reflex: By using a pacifier-activated lullaby device, music {{therapists}} can help promote stronger sucking reflexes, while also reducing pain perception for the infant. The Gato Box {{is a small}} rectangular instrument that stimulates a prenatal heartbeat sound in a soft and rhythmic manner that has also been effective in aiding sucking behaviours. The music therapist uses their fingers to <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the drum, rather than using a mallet. The rhythm supports movement when feeding and promotes healthy sucking patterns. By improving sucking patterns, babies are able to coordinate the important dual mechanisms of breathing, sucking and swallowing needed to feed, thus promoting growth and weight gain. When this treatment proves effective, infants are able to leave the hospital earlier.|$|E
25|$|Males {{may also}} use more {{indirect}} techniques {{to mate with}} females, such as intimidation. While most female water striders (Gerridae) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species Gerris gracilicornis have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, {{it is in the}} best interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.|$|E
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
