25|$|Irish LGBT {{immigrants}} often experience vulnerability in {{the absence}} of family networks, which is exacerbated in the context of homophobia and sexual discrimination. Legal protection against sexual discrimination in employment was only introduced in the UK in 2003. Even when legislative provisions and support are in place, homophobia continues <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> and the process of migration difficult for queer migrants.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} for post-polio syndrome is generally palliative {{and consists of}} rest, analgesia (pain relief) and utilisation of mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> easier such as powered wheelchairs. There are no reversive therapies. Fatigue is usually the most disabling symptom; energy conservation can significantly reduce fatigue episodes. Such conservation can be achieved with lifestyle changes, reducing workload and daytime sleeping. Weight loss is also recommended if patients are obese. In some cases, the use of lower limb orthotics can reduce energy usage.|$|E

After years spent in the most exclusive private schools in Manhattan, the three Coffin children were educated in Carmel's public schools, where William had his first sense that there was injustice—sometimes very great—in the world.|$|E
25|$|Open {{units are}} {{psychiatric}} units {{that are not}} as secure as crisis stabilization units. They are not used for acutely suicidal persons; the focus in these units is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> as normal as possible for patients while continuing treatment {{to the point where}} they can be discharged. However, patients are usually still not allowed to hold their own medications in their rooms, because of the risk of an impulsive overdose. While some open units are physically unlocked, other open units still use locked entrances and exits depending on the type of patients admitted.|$|E
25|$|Mammals {{that favor}} forest habitat predominate within the Slide Wilderness. Among the 49 species known to exist there, black bears have done {{exceptionally}} well, as have snowshoe hare, gray squirrel and porcupine. White-tailed deer, who were successfully reintroduced into New York in 1887 via a protected habitat on lands {{now part of}} the wilderness area, winter here. Cottontail rabbit and beaver also maintain lower population levels. Fisher were reintroduced to the area in the late 1970s and have thrived in numbers significant enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> difficult for the porcupine, always abundant in the Catskills.|$|E

25|$|Another more vindictive {{motivation}} for {{bringing in the}} indoor soccer side was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> {{more difficult for the}} expansion Western Hockey League team, the Edmonton Ice. Pocklington had wanted a WHL franchise in Edmonton for himself, but was never granted one. So when Ed Chynoweth stepped down as WHL commissioner and was promptly granted a franchise in Edmonton, needless to say it rubbed Pocklington the wrong way. As a result, the Ice were not allowed to play at the Pocklington controlled Coliseum, and were instead left to play their games at the somewhat less fan friendly Northlands Agricom. On top of that it was standard practice to schedule Driller games head-to-head with Ice games, and distribute large quantities of complimentary tickets.|$|E
25|$|Two {{settlers}} {{who were}} staying near Fort Antes {{were killed in}} June 1777. A party of four men and two women had left {{the safety of the}} fort and crossed the West Branch of the Susquehanna River to milk some cows that had been left there to pasture. Zephaniah Miller, Abel Cady, and James Armstrong left the riverbank and meadow to gather a cow who had wandered into the surrounding woods. These three men came under attack by a group of warriors who had been hiding in the woods. Sounds of fighting stirred the men at the fort. They crossed the river despite the objections of Colonel Antes who thought that the Native Americans might have set a trap. Upon reaching {{the other side of the}} river, the militiamen found Miller dead and Cady and Armstrong mortally wounded. Only Bouser and the women, one of them Cady's wife, survived the attack. This was just one of many attacks in the West Branch Valley that continued <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> more dangerous for the settlers, who were encroaching on tribal land.|$|E
25|$|In 1964–65, Simpson led Australia {{on a tour}} of the Caribbean, {{which was}} marred by controversies over umpiring {{standards}} and the legality of West Indian Charlie Griffith's bowling action. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> more difficult, some of the grounds had no sightscreens, making it even harder to see the ball. Griffith also dragged his foot, bringing him around a metre closer to the batsman before releasing his balls at extreme pace. Simpson initially struggled against Griffith, failing to pass 30 in the first three Tests as Australia conceded a 0–2 lead. He scored only 87 in five innings, but had success with the ball, capturing 4/83 in the second innings of the Second Test at Trinidad. Adjusting his technique, Simpson scored 201 in the Fourth Test at Barbados, where he set an Australian record opening stand of 382 with Lawry. The match was drawn, but Australia managed a consolation win in the Fifth Test, to which Simpson contributed 72 and 34 not out. His average for 399 runs was 49.88 and he took 11 catches. Simpson made his displeasure regarding Griffith known to the Australian board, and this was relayed to the West Indian administrators.|$|E

Journalist Henry Winter, writing for The Daily Telegraph, refuted Evans' claims, instead saying that [...] "it was people’s disgust that a convicted rapist felt he could swan back into a high-profile job after revealing no remorse for a crime that would preclude re-employment for many", while criticising Evans for making [...] "his statement of contrition ... on the offensive, legally questionable website that continues <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> miserable for his victim".|$|E

500|$|In prison, she {{was again}} {{assigned}} {{to work as}} a seamstress, under the eye of a [...] "miserable gutter-snipe of a 21-year-old boy paid to get results". She met the socialist Kate Richards O'Hare, who had also been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. Although they differed on political strategy—Kate O'Hare believed in voting to achieve state power—the two women came together to agitate for better conditions among prisoners. Goldman also met and became friends with Gabriella Segata Antolini, an anarchist and follower of Luigi Galleani. Antolini had been arrested transporting a satchel filled with dynamite on a Chicago-bound train. She had refused to cooperate with authorities, and was sent to prison for 14 months. Working together <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> better for the other inmates, the three women became known as [...] "The Trinity". Goldman was released on September 27, 1919.|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult. The ground was swampy, and the trenches quickly became filled knee-deep in water. Montgomery described his army as [...] "half-drowned rats crawling through a swamp". To make matters even worse, food and ammunition supplies were running out, and the British {{showed no sign of}} giving in despite the American bombardment. Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans; by mid-October, more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness. In {{the early days of the}} siege, the fort's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries. Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that [...] "a deserter [...] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as much as we can with shells." [...] Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga, the fort's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower.|$|E

Looking back at The Quatermass Experiment in a 1981 article for The Times, journalist Geoffrey Wansell highlighted the finale:"Westminster Abbey undoubtedly dominated television during the summer of 1953 but it was not just the Coronation of the Queen that sticks in my mind now. It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey's nave… The Quatermass Experiment frightened the life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation… Quatermass {{was one of the first}} series on British television <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>life</b> seem potentially terrifying." ...|$|E
