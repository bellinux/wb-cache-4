5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E

How plain are the words! Christ, in saving of me, has given to the world a pattern of his grace, that they might see, and believe, and come, and be saved; that they {{that are to be}} born hereafter might believe on Jesus Christ to life everlasting.|$|R
25|$|Attendance {{in these}} early years was high despite the team's poor on-field performances.

Bearing a strong resemblance to the Volkswagen Rabbit, the front-wheel drive Omni and Horizon became instant hits, selling over 300,000 units each in their debut year, showing what was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> Chrysler. The Omni had been designed alongside the Chrysler Horizon with much input from the Chrysler Europe division of the company (evidenced by many examples having VW/Audi engines), which Iacocca axed in 1978.|$|E

25|$|The Cardinals opened 2011 {{with a loss}} at {{home against}} the San Diego Padres on March 31, after leading 3–2 with two outs in the 9th inning. Matt Holliday hit {{what looked to be}} the game-winning home run {{in the bottom of the}} 8th, but closer Ryan Franklin gave up a game-tying home run in that 9th inning, sending the game to extra innings. The Padres scored twice in the 11th to win 5–3. It was a sign of things <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> Franklin in 2011.|$|E
25|$|After World War I {{passenger}} traffic {{as well as}} goods and mineral business declined further. Worse was <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>for</b> the Railways Act 1921 put both the G and the Caledonian/L routes under common ownership of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The former G routes had better connectivity for the now sparse traffic, and on 28 July 1930 the first closure, to {{passenger traffic}} on the Irvine branch, took place. Total closure of the branch followed on 30 December 1930. The Kilbirnie branch too closed in 1930.|$|E
25|$|Kosmina got {{the side}} of to a flying start under his tenure, his first match in charge, a clash with then table-topping rivals Central Coast, a thrilling 3–2 victory {{in front of a}} crowd of nearly 18,000 at the SFS, a sign of bigger things <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the Blues. This was {{followed}} by an impressive 1–0 away victory over Newcastle Jets; with former England junior Michael Bridges recording his first goal for Sydney FC. An entertaining 0–0 draw at the Telstra Dome, with rivals Melbourne, followed, with Sydney FC still undefeated under Kosmina.|$|E

25|$|On January 11, 1993, Max Moon {{wrestled}} {{and lost}} an Intercontinental Championship match to former tag team partner/longtime rival Shawn Michaels {{on the very}} first Monday Night Raw. The loss to Michaels {{was a sign of}} things <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the Max Moon gimmick as he began losing to midcarders such as Skinner. The Max Moon gimmick only appeared at one PPV, participating in the 30 Man Elimination match at the 1993 Royal Rumble, where he was in the ring less than 2 minutes. In late February, Paul Diamond’s contract with the WWF expired and was not renewed.|$|E
25|$|It was March 1968 at a minor club meeting when 17-year-old racer Barry Sheene {{lined up}} on the {{starting}} grid, on a works 125cc Bultaco, for his first race. It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards. Sheene had worked his way up to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars. A rostrum position in the day's 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better wasn’t very far away. Just one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, and he did it is style by an incredible 12 seconds. And the best was yet <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>for</b> he dominated a field of 350cc machines, riding special 250cc Bultaco (with an enlarged 280cc capacity).|$|E

25|$|The second mission, {{scheduled}} for launch in July 2020, {{will have an}} 1800kg Russian-built landing platform system derived from the 2016 Schiaparelli EDM lander, to place the ExoMars rover {{on the surface of}} Mars. This lander platform will be built 80% by the Russian company Lavochkin, and 20% by ESA. Lavochkin will produce most of the landing system's hardware, while ESA will handle elements such as the guidance, radar and navigation systems. Lavochkin's current landing strategy is to use two parachutes; one will open while the module is still moving at supersonic speed, and another will deploy once the probe has been slowed down to subsonic velocity. The heat shield will eventually fall away from the entry capsule to allow the ExoMars rover, riding its retro-rocket-equipped lander, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> a soft landing on legs or struts. The surface platform lander will then deploy ramps for the rover to drive down.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 16th century Baku's wealth and {{strategic}} position attracted {{the focus of}} its larger neighbors; in the previous two centuries, it was {{under the rule of}} the in Iran-centred Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian Safavid dynasty, led by king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501-1524). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power, and made Baku a part of the Shirvan province. Baku remained {{as an integral part of}} his empire and the successive Iranian dynasties <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> the next centuries, until the irrevocable cession in the first half of the 19th century. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of the Safavid rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, Genoa came to Parma led by ex-Parma manager Alberto Malesani as Parma {{looked to}} put an end to their indifferent early season form and Genoa went in search of a second win at the Tardini on their twentieth visit. They were able to make their good start to the first half pay with a goal from a delightful Giovinco lob on the half-hour mark after a neat Sergio Floccari assist. As the first half drew to a close, Giovinco's mazy dribble was then illegally halted in the penalty area by Juraj Kucka and Parma were awarded a penalty; Giovinco himself converted the resultant spot kick. As Genoa threw more men forward, the chances continued <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>for</b> Parma and a fine counter-attack ended with a Stefano Morrone finish from inches out after he had somehow conspired to hit the bar from 6 yards out. The gloss of a fine victory was taken off when Genoa themselves were awarded a penalty for a Gabriel Paletta tug on Rodrigo Palacio in the last minute and the Argentine got up to score the penalty and round off the scoring at 3–1. This lifted Parma out of the relegation zone and Giovinco to the top of the scoring charts, alongside fellow 5-goal frontman Rodrigo Palacio.|$|E
