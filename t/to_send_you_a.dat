2500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "On Earth Peace, Goodwill towards Men", the letter's salutation {{addressed}} [...] "Sisters" [...] and began, [...] "Some of us wish <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> word at this sad Christmastide, though we can but speak through the Press..." [...] The {{women of the}} UK were prevented from direct communication with the women of Germany because of the war. Instead, they sent their missive to America which {{was at that time}} a neutral nation. The letter continued, [...] "The Christmas message sounds like mockery to a world at war, but those of us who wished and still wish for peace may surely offer a solemn greeting to such of you who feel as we do." [...] The letter mentioned that, as in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, [...] "the brunt of modern war falls upon non-combatants, and the conscience of the world cannot bear the sight." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not my fate, and everything is the will of God." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Sperry {{could only}} gaze blankly {{at his brother}} official. Had they heard aright? Was this the {{recklessness}} of nervous excitement in a woman of delicate health, or had the impostor cast some glamour upon her? Or was she frightened of Sam Barstow and afraid to reject his candidate? The last thought was an inspiration. He drew her quickly aside. [...] "One moment, Mrs. Martin! You said to me an hour ago that you didn't intend to have asked Mr. Barstow <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> assistant.

60|$|I {{hope to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> {{impression}} of an engraving, from a picture of Mr. Haydon, representing me in the act of climbing Helvellyn. There is great merit in this work, and the sight of it will show my meaning on the subject of expression. This, I think, is attained; but, then, I am stooping, and the inclination of the head necessarily causes a foreshortening of the features below the nose, which takes from the likeness accordingly; so that, upon the whole, yours has the advantage, especially under the circumstance of your never having seen the original. Mrs. Wordsworth has been looking over your letters in vain to find the address of the person in London, through whose hands any parcel for you might be sent.
