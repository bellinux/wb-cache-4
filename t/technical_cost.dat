40|$|The German {{insurance}} market was liberalized in 1994 by {{the introduction of}} the ‘single passport’ allowing European insurers to operate throughout the entire European Union. The European directive put also an end to price and insurance contract terms regulation. These measures were meant for removing the obstacles to competition within and between the {{insurance market}}s of the member states aiming at an increased efficiency of the European insurance markets. We analyze to which extent this aim has been achieved in the German life insurance market. The development of market performance is measured by changes in <b>technical</b> <b>cost</b> and profit efficiency levels since the liberalization, as well as a measurement of technological change. <b>Technical</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency levels are estimated by applying a stochastic “true” fixed effects distance frontier (Greene, 2005). Non-standard profit efficiency is derived in a second step following Kumbakhar (2006). According to our results, the industry experienced positive total factor productivity (TFP) growth during the observation period, which is mainly driven by substantial positive technological change. <b>Technical</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency and profit efficiency remained stable on average, but significant positive scale efficiency change can be found indicating that market consolidation in the presence of increasing returns to scale led to efficiency gains of the firms.

40|$|This {{presentation}} will {{bridge the}} divide between these separate but overlapping disciplines and help explain how to use Risk Management as an effective management decision support tool that includes safety. Risk Management is an over arching communication tool used by management to prioritize and effectively mitigate potential problems before they concur. Risk Management encompasses every kind of potential problem that can occur on a program or project. Some of these are safety issues such as hazards that have a specific likelihood and consequence {{that need to be}} controlled and included to show an integrated picture of accepted) mitigated, and residual risk. Integrating safety and other assurance disciplines is paramount to accurately representing a program s or projects risk posture. Risk is made up of several components such as <b>technical)</b> <b>cost,</b> schedule, or supportability. Safety should also be a consideration for every risk. The safety component can also {{have an impact on the}} <b>technical,</b> <b>cost,</b> and schedule aspect of a given risk.

The regression results show that firm size has {{a positive impact on}} pure <b>technical,</b> scale and <b>cost</b> efficiencies. The impacts of a firm's service concentration on pure technical and scale efficiencies are positive, but its impact on allocative efficiency is negative. Firms with a branch or branches are less efficient than those without any branch in terms of pure <b>technical,</b> scale and <b>cost</b> efficiencies. Firms with low operating risks are more efficient than those with high operating risk in terms of cost and allocative efficiencies. Competition pressure forces integrated securities firms to improve their pure <b>technical</b> and <b>cost</b> efficiencies, and shrinks the differences of pure technical efficiency among them in 1993. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to measure and {{investigate}} efficiency and productivity by using Data Envelopment Analysis technique (DEA) and Malmquist Total Factor Productivity (TFP) index for cross-section time series data involving 26 firms of Libyan construction firms over the period 1995 - 2005. A multiple input-output nonparametric model was used to measure <b>technical,</b> <b>cost,</b> revenue and profit efficiencies. Source of productivity growth was also investigated to identify for efficiency change or technology change of the firms under study. The input variables comprise assets, equity and numbers of employees, while the output variables are revenue and profit. This study also examines the impact of three moderating' variables - size, age and change of government policy (or deregulation) on the efficiency and productivity measures of the firms concerned. Change of government policy refers to Libya opening its doors to foreign companies to operate in its country beginning 2003. This study also conducts statistical test of significance for the overall results, in particular the Mann-Whitney's Test was used to test hypothesis for the moderating variables. The relationship between <b>technical,</b> <b>cost,</b> revenue and profit efficiency scores are also tested for their statistical significance before interpretation in the light of hypothesis of interest...|$|E
