25|$|If the AMPK {{response}} to exercise is responsible {{in part for}} biochemical adaptations <b>to</b> <b>training,</b> how then can these adaptations <b>to</b> <b>training</b> be maintained if the AMPK {{response to}} exercise is being attenuated with training? It is hypothesized that these adaptive roles <b>to</b> <b>training</b> are maintained by AMPK activity and that the increases in AMPK activity in response <b>to</b> exercise in <b>trained</b> skeletal muscle {{have not yet been}} observed due to biochemical adaptations that the training itself stimulated in the muscle tissue to reduce the metabolic need for AMPK activation. In other words, due to previous adaptations <b>to</b> <b>training,</b> AMPK will not be activated, and further adaptation will not occur, until the intracellular ATP levels become depleted from an even higher intensity energy challenge than prior to those previous adaptations.|$|R
