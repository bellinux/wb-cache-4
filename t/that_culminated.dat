5|$|According to the French Byzantinist Henri Grégoire, the Byzantine success {{against the}} Arabs <b>that</b> <b>culminated</b> with the Battle of Lalakaon {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} one of the oldest surviving acritic (heroic) poems: the Song of Armouris.

A battle from the Byzantine heroic cycle around Digenis Akritas also strongly recalls the events of Lalakaon, as the eponymous hero surrounds an Arab army near Malakopeia. Strong influences can be found in episodes in the Arab, and later Turkish, epic cycles around Battal Ghazi, as well as an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights.|$|E
