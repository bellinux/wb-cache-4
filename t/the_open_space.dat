5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|E

5|$|The Hippodrome of Constantinople (really a Roman circus, not <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> {{that the}} {{original}} Greek hippodromes were) {{was connected to the}} emperor's palace and the Church of Hagia Sophia, allowing spectators to view the emperor as they had in Rome. Citizens used their proximity to the emperor in the circuses and theatres to express public opinion, like their dissatisfaction with the Emperor's errant policy. It has been argued that the people became so powerful that the emperors {{had no choice but to}} grant them more legal rights. However, contrary to this traditional view, it appears, based on more recent historical research, that the Byzantine emperors treated the protests and petitions of their citizens in the circuses with greater contempt and were more dismissive of them than their Roman predecessors. Justinian I (r. 527–565), for instance, seems to have been dismissive of the Greens' petitions and to have never negotiated with them at all.|$|E
5|$|The nine-story building, {{built in}} 1977, {{was named for}} a federal judge and housed fourteenfederal agencies, {{including}} the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.

In addition, McVeigh believed that <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes.

5|$|The {{precious}} metals {{silver and gold}} were not common in the Eastern Ranges, while copper was mined in Gachantivá, Moniquirá and in {{the mountains to the}} south of the Bogotá savanna at Sumapaz. The process of elaborating the fine filigree figures took place by creating a mold of obsidian, shale or clay, filling <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> with bee wax, obtained through trade with the neighbouring indigenous peoples from the Llanos Orientales to the east of the Altiplano; the Achagua, Tegua and Guayupe. The bee wax occupied the voids of the mold and the mold was heated by fires. The bee wax would melt, leaving an open space where the tumbaga or sometimes gold was poured into, a process called lost-wax casting. Using this method, modern tunjos are still fabricated in the centre of Bogotá.|$|E

5|$|Three {{potential}} {{sites were}} {{considered for the}} memorial: Albert Square, Piccadilly Gardens and St Peter's Square. With {{the support of the}} Royal British Legion, Albert Square emerged as the favourite. The site proved controversial after the artistic community led the objections to the removal and relocation of statues in the square, which would have been required to create a suitable space for the war memorial. King George V consented to the relocation of the memorial to his German grandfather, Prince Albert, but objections persisted and the city architect estimated the cost of relocating the statues at £8,400. The city council voted to reject Albert Square and identified Piccadilly Gardens as its second choice. The city council was considering building an art gallery on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>space</b> left after the old infirmary was demolished. Siting the memorial in front of it was supported by the Art Gallery Committee. As nothing was decided, any plans for the area would have delayed the war memorial project further and the council settled on St Peter's Square.|$|E

5|$|US31/M-37 {{enters the}} south side of Traverse City near the {{intersection}} with South Airport Road and the Grand Traverse Mall. As the highway heads towards Grand Traverse Bay and downtown, it passes several car dealerships, an outlet mall and other retailers. After the city limits, the roadway is also given the name Division Street. North of 14th Street, US31/M-37 passes the former Traverse City State Hospital, a Kirkbride Plan former mental asylum. This section of town is mostly residential except for the old state hospital and Munson Medical Center. North of Front Street, Division Street meets Grandview Parkway. This roadway runs along the bay from the northwest carrying M-22/M-72. When the two streets meet, M-22 ends, and US31/M-37 and M-72 merge into a triple concurrency along the bay north of downtown Traverse City. Grandview Parkway passes <b>the</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Space</b> park, the marina, the former Clinch Park Zoo and runs along a narrow piece of land between the Boardman River and the bay. Grandview Parkway ends east of the mouth of the river, and the highway continues along Front Street past the Great Lakes Maritime Academy and the home berth of the TS State of Michigan to Garfield Avenue near the campus of Northwestern Michigan College. M-37 turns north along Garfield Avenue to Peninsula Drive, leaving US31/M-72.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Under {{conditions}} of high stress, interactions between species can be positive. Islands of peren-nial vegetation {{can improve the}} {{conditions of}} the understory and facilitate the establishment of herbaceous plants. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} islands of perennial vegetation in an area of caatinga harbor, a great-er richness, diversity and density of herbaceous plants, and that individuals reach a greater height and diameter than in <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> <b>The</b> study was conducted in Petrolândia, Pernambuco, Brazil. Twenty-seven plots were installed in the center of the islands, 38 at the edge of the islands (in a total of 38 islands) and 35 in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> A total of 51 species were recorded in the center and 55 on the edge of the islands and 48 in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> <b>The</b> mean richness of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> was lower than on the islands. The diversity was greater in the center of the island and became less on the edge of the island and in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> <b>The</b> mean density was lower in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> than on <b>the</b> islands. The mean density at the edge of the islands was greater than in the center of the islands. There was no difference in mean diameter of herbaceous plants. The mean height of the individuals was higher in the center of the islands. The herbaceous community growing on the islands exhibited higher richness, diversity, density and height than in <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> Thus, islands of perennial vegetation facili-tate the establishment of herbaceous species...|$|R
