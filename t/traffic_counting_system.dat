40|$|AbstractThe NorSIKT {{project is}} carried out in {{cooperation}} between all Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Island, Finland and Norway) and is financed by the NordFOU Research Cooperation (ministered by the Director Generals in each country). The main objective of the NorSIKT project is to standardize the system for classification of motor vehicles in the Nordic countries in order. In {{the first phase of}} the project a detailed survey of the traffic data system in the Nordic countries was carried out. The state-of-the-art report presents the situation in terms of current definitions for the classification of vehicles and describes the <b>traffic</b> <b>counting</b> <b>systems</b> in each country. The state-of-the-art report has furthermore been used as a basis for developing a preliminary vehicle classification system introducing some new principles where vehicles can be classified from different types of properties like length, weight, number of axels, type of fuel, etc. Each country can adopt the classification properties that best meet the needs in the country. In the second and ongoing phase different type of registration equipment on the Nordic market will be tested to investigate how different type of equipment meets different classification principles...|$|R
40|$|A {{serious problem}} in {{analysing}} <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> data is {{what to do when}} missing or extreme values occur, perhaps {{as a result of a}} breakdown in automatic counting equipment. The objectives of this current work were to attempt to look at ways of solving this problem by: 1) establishing the applicability of time series and influence function techniques for estimating missing values and detecting outliers in time series traffic data; 2) making a comparative assessment of new techniques with those used by traffic engineers in practice for local, regional or national <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> <b>systems</b> Two alternative approaches were identified as being potentially useful and these were evaluated and compared with methods currently employed for `cleaning' <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> series. These were based on evaluating the effect of individual or groups of observations on the estimate of the auto-correlation structure and events influencing a parametric model (ARIMA). These were compared with the existing methods which included visual inspection and smoothing techniques such as the exponentially weighted moving average in which means and variances are updated using observations from the same time and day of week. The results showed advantages and disadvantages for each of the methods. The exponentially weighted moving average method tended to detect unreasonable outliers and also suggested replacements which were consistently larger than could reasonably be expected. Methods based on the autocorrelation structure were reasonably successful in detecting events but the replacement values were suspect particularly when there were groups of values needing replacement. The methods also had problems in the presence of non-stationarity, often detecting outliers which were really a result of the changing level of the data rather than extreme values. In the presence of other events, such as a change in level or seasonality, both the influence function and change in autocorrelation present problems of interpretation since there is no way of distinguishing these events from outliers. It is clear that the outlier problem cannot be separated from that of identifying structural changes as many of the statistics used to identify outliers also respond to structural changes. The ARIMA (1, 0, 0) (0, 1, 1) 7 was found to describe the vast majority of <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> series which means that the problem of identifying a starting model can largely be avoided with a high degree of assurance. Unfortunately it is clear that a black-box approach to data validation is prone to error but methods such as those described above lend themselves to an interactive graphics data-validation technique in which outliers and other events are highlighted requiring acceptance or otherwise manually. An adaptive approach to fitting the model may result in something which can be more automatic and this would allow for changes in the underlying model to be accommodated. In conclusion it was found that methods based on the autocorrelation structure are the most computationally efficient but lead to problems of interpretation both between different types of event and in the presence of non-stationarity. Using the residuals from a fitted ARIMA model is the most successful method at finding outliers and distinguishing them from other events, being less expensive than case deletion. The replacement values derived from the ARIMA model were found to be the most accurate...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{technology}} in performing <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> has become widely used by many transportation agencies and private sectors. Different technologies have been employed to perform such counts, such as inductive loops, image processing, Bluetooth technologies, and laser and infrared technologies. However, {{the use of these}} advanced technologies come with extra cost to develop, install, and maintain. While the use of advanced technologies provide reliable <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> and vehicle classifications data, the use of manual traffic is an inevitable task. Manual <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> can serve different purposes, such as performing quality control or conducting short-term traffic survey.

50|$|A <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> is a {{count of}} {{vehicular}} or pedestrian traffic, which is conducted along a particular road, path, or intersection. A <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> is commonly undertaken either automatically (with the installation of a temporary or permanent electronic traffic recording device), or manually by observers who visually <b>count</b> and record <b>traffic</b> on a hand-held electronic device or tally sheet. <b>Traffic</b> <b>counts</b> {{can be used by}} local councils to identify which routes are used most, and to either improve that road or provide an alternative if there is an excessive amount of traffic. Also, some geography fieldwork involves a <b>traffic</b> <b>count.</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>counts</b> provide the source data used to calculate the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), which is the common indicator used to represent <b>traffic</b> volume. <b>Traffic</b> <b>counts</b> are useful for comparing two or more roads, and can also be used alongside other methods to find out where the CBD of a settlement is located. <b>Traffic</b> <b>counts</b> that include speeds are used in speed limit enforcement efforts, highlighting peak speeding periods to optimise speed camera use and educational efforts.|$|R

40|$|All the {{elements}} of a transportation system model generally suffer from some approximation. Normally the demand vector is considered the most crucial and problematic element to be simulated, and <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> are thus generally used to update it so that the whole model system is able to reproduce the observed link flows.

30|$|In {{this section}} {{based on the}} OD demand {{coverage}} criterion, a set of highly demanding roads are identified. To put it plainly, the candidate roads must be of highest importance. Such interpretation gives birth to a whole different problem in transportation in which <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> posts for OD estimation (ODE) are sought. The task of ODE is centered on adjusting an outdated OD demand data based on a recently compiled <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> of “some selected count posts.” Obviously, the <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> posts are placed on the road. Evidently, traffic survey and the count are a costly job, and hence, {{it is not possible}} to have <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> on all roads. Now the question to be first answered is: Which roads must be selected as count posts to be used in the ODE? It is also a valid answer to the SLP.|$|R

40|$|This study {{dealt with}} {{estimating}} AADT which serves the important basic data in transportation sector. AADT estimation {{is fundamental to}} the analysis of transportation data sets and the management of transportation systems. AADT is estimated using short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> at most sites because permanent <b>traffic</b> <b>counts</b> is installed at limited sites. To estimate AADT, an adjustment factor application model was proposed on FHWA's Traffic Monitoring Guide in the United States. This model uses monthly or weekly adjustment factors to estimate AADT. Additionally, grouping with monthly factor, weekly factor and hourly volume pattern was proposed, but these methods don’t reflect characteristics of daily pattern. So this study used daily factor to estimate AADT and compared with advanced research. Daily factor is produced 365 factors on one permanent <b>traffic</b> <b>count.</b> Accuracy of AADT was enhanced using daily factor because it reflects daily characteristics as compared to monthly or weekly factors. But it is most important to assign a site to its similar site, because unsimilar assignment carries the greatest potential for significant estimation error.

Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATRs) are used to provide continuous <b>traffic</b> <b>count</b> coverage at selected locations to estimate annual average daily traffic (AADT).

An Android Tablet-based manual <b>traffic</b> <b>counting</b> application was developed to acquire manual count based ground truth data. The performance of VDS was evaluated under various conditions including mounting styles, heights, and roadway offsets. The results indicated that VDS data presents reasonably accurate data, although the data exhibits more variability compared to ATR data...|$|R
