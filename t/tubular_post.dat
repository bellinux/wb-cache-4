2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} <b>tubular</b> <b>post</b> with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would have to {{jump up and down}} to 'establish a forward drive to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which is connected to the core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{block of}} masonry toilets {{to the rear of}} the hall. A high fence of <b>tubular</b> metal <b>posts</b> and metal mesh {{surrounds}} the site.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{entrance}} archway, located towards {{the centre of}} the southern boundary fence, features an arched metal sign supported by <b>tubular</b> metal <b>posts</b> on top of stone pylons and reading [...] "CLERMONT CEMETERY".|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} measures 7.5 metres by 3.7 metres. It is an approximately 1 metre high timber {{framed and}} sheet metal clad fence, with <b>tubular</b> steel <b>posts</b> angled in {{to support a}} birdwire perimeter to approximately 1.8 metres high.|$|R
50|$|Parallel to {{the goods}} shed on roughly the former {{alignment}} of the main line is an open shelter shed, consisting of a low-pitched gabled corrugated iron roof supported on <b>tubular</b> steel <b>posts,</b> enclosed with cyclone wire mesh. It houses a passenger carriage and two small motorised railcars.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} measures 4.6 metres by 2.5 metres. It is an approximately 2.5 metres high {{structure with}} concrete blockwork base walls and <b>tubular</b> steel <b>posts</b> supporting upper level metal mesh and a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement skillion roof. Flat asbestos cement sheeting {{is located on}} the west wall. The enclosure has elaborate timber perches and a steel framed and sheeted gate.|$|R
5000|$|Blackall Masonic Lodge {{is located}} in the centre of a level site at the corner of Hawthorn and Garden Streets. Its axis runs east west and it faces west and is {{parallel}} to Garden Street. It has a rectangular plan form and is two storeyed and supported on timber stumps. It has a gabled roof with a verandah on the north, west and east sides supported by 4" [...] chamfered timber posts at 6' 0" [...] centres. Bougainvillea are located on the north and south sides and at the south west corner of the site. The boundary fence consists of short <b>tubular</b> <b>posts</b> with chain suspended between; this replaced an earlier timber and chain wire fence. The original single rolled steel entrance gate which was located on the axis of the building in Hawthorne Street has been replaced with a set of low double gates which have maintained the rolled steel beehive pattern. What appear to be original gate posts have been relocated inside this gate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tubular</b> steel <b>posts</b> are {{employed}} {{on the third}} level, while the top floor utilised steel ties to truss the vertical section of the sawtooth roof, thereby achieving a span of 30 metres which required only a central row of steel columns. The showroom also has square vents with timber louvers beneath the windows, and the customary sawtooth roof aligned {{from east to west}} for optimum lighting.|$|R
40|$|Two two-bay {{pultruded}} {{glass fibre}} reinforced polymer (GFRP) post and rail safety barriers have been fabricated. One, a modular barrier, was fabricated from circular cross-section tubes, bolted sheet moulded composite (SMC) two-part multi-way connectors and bases. The other, a custom barrier, was fabricated from three profiles: square cross-section <b>tubular</b> <b>posts,</b> a circular cross-section tubular knee rail and a C-section hand rail. Rivets connected the hand rail to {{the tops of}} the posts and bolted bases connected the posts to the foundation. The continuous knee rail was located by means of holes in the posts’ walls. Both barriers were loaded incrementally up to the general duty load applied to the hand rail and then unloaded. Their load–deformation responses were monitored and both barriers were able to support the general duty load undamaged. After unloading the maximum residual deflection of the hand rail was about 5 mm. The barriers’ mean transverse stiffnesses were evaluated and the custom barrier’s stiffness was about 46 % greater than that of the modular barrier. The custom barrier was re-tested up to the heavy duty load and was able to support the load without visible signs of damage...|$|R
500|$|The {{cemetery}} perimeter {{is lined}} {{on three sides}} by a cast wrought iron fence, accessible by a gate [...] in width at its western entryway. The wrought iron fence is [...] in height, and has approximately [...] diameter <b>tubular</b> fence <b>posts,</b> which are supported by three horizontal metal rails. The fence posts are capped with white-painted stylized arrows, with a ball at the tip. A shield with the emblem reading, [...] "The Stewart Iron Works, Cincinnati, Ohio", is emblazoned on the fence's gate. The cemetery's eastern extension is surrounded by chain-link fencing.|$|R
30|$|Kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1) {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in renal proximal <b>tubular</b> cells in <b>post</b> ischaemic situations while the concentration in urine of healthy humans is low (Ichimura et al. 2004; Schrezenmeier et al. 2017). Urine-KIM- 1 and U-NGAL {{are assumed to}} be highly sensitive, early markers of proximal tubular injury and thus, appropriate for perioperative use (Schrezenmeier et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the differences}} between two calculation models for guardrails on building sites that use wooden boards and <b>tubular</b> steel <b>posts.</b> Wood was considered an isotropic material in one model and an orthotropic material in a second model. The elastic constants of the wood were obtained with ultrasound. Frequencies and vibration modes were obtained for both models through linear analysis using the finite element method. The two models were experimentally calibrated through operational modal analysis. The results obtained show that for {{the three types of}} wood under analysis, the model which considered them as an orthotropic material fitted the experimental results better than the model which considered them as an isotropic material...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mass grave}} {{containing}} {{the victims of}} the flood is enclosed by a low fence, made from <b>tubular</b> steel <b>posts</b> with chain slung between them. Two marked grave plots containing flood victims are also enclosed by the fence. One belongs to Richard Hooper. The inscription states he [...] "was drowned in the great flood of Clermont". The grave also contains his wife Elizabeth Jane Hooper who died in 1956 aged 85. It consists of a marble plaque attached to a granite headstone, with a low concrete grave kerb surrounding a concrete slab covered in black and white tiles. Four immortelles sit on top of the slab and a marble plaque with the words [...] "Mother Father" [...] are attached to the kerb {{at the foot of the}} grave. The other marked grave, located further to the south, has a concrete headstone with marble plaque, concrete grave kerb and gravel infill. The three names listed on this plaque are: John Thomas Wicks, Peter Olsson and Evelyn Olsson. The inscription states that they [...] "were drowned in the flood of Dec 1916".|$|R
