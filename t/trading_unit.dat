40|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>unit</b> {{values are}} {{commonly}} used as proxies for trade prices in empirical research in international economics. Existing datasets providing international <b>trade</b> <b>unit</b> values for {{a large number of}} countries typically suffer from a number of statistical biases, due to the aggregation of unit values and the harmonization of quantity information. These biases reduce the reliability of unit values as a proxy for trade prices. This paper presents the <b>Trade</b> <b>Unit</b> Values dataset, a new database developed to circumvent these statistical issues. Bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>unit</b> values are computed at a very high level of disaggregation before aggregation into Harmonized-System 6 -digits categories to allow for cross-country comparability. Our processing strategy improves the differentiation of trade prices within product categories, as compared to existing worldwide datasets. A simple econometric analysis shows that unit values in our database are well explained by economic aggregates. <b>UNIT</b> VALUE;TRADE PRICE;INTERNATIONAL <b>TRADE...</b>|$|R

5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a <b>trade</b> <b>unit</b> earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's <b>trading</b> <b>units</b> may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the <b>trading</b> <b>units</b> infinitely continue to trade.|$|R
