30|$|If <b>the</b> {{unimodal}} <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> weight n are not strongly unimodal <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> weight n, {{then they}} are usually referred as weakly unimodal <b>sequences.</b> For example, <b>the</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> binomial coefficients {nj}_j= 0 ^n are <b>the</b> unimodal <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> weight 2 ^n.

5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> bases in each copy are precisely complementary to <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E

5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E

In addition, while <b>the</b> periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_z pulses produces a spectrum that is dependent on the detuning between the emitter and the pulse carrier frequency, <b>the</b> Uhrig <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> nonequidistant π_x pulses and <b>the</b> periodic <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> π_xπ_y pulses have spectra with little dependence on the detuning as long as it stays moderate along with the number of pulses.

5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds new light on <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. <b>The</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> amino acid residues in a protein is defined by <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, {{the function of the}} proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
40|$|Complementary DNAs {{encoding}} mouse liver insulin-like {{growth factor}} I (IGF-I) have been isolated and sequenced. Alternative RNA splicing {{results in the}} synthesis of two types of mouse IGF-I precursor that differ in <b>the</b> size and <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> COOH-tenninal peptide. <b>The</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal peptides, IGF-I moieties and the first 16 amino acids of the CCOH-terminal peptides or E-domains of the two precursors are identical. <b>The</b> <b>sequence</b> difference results from the presence in preproIGF-IB mRNA of a 52 base insertion which introduces a 17 amino acid segment into the COOH-terminal peptide of preproIGF-IB and also causes {{a shift in the}} reading frame of the mRNA. As a consequence of this insertion, the COOH-terminal 19 and 25 amino acids of mouse preproIGF-IA and-IB, respectively, are different. <b>The</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> mouse and human preproIGF-IA are highly conserved and possess 94 Z identity.
