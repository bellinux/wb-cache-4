The Type Approval value for CO 2 {{emissions of}} passenger cars {{is based on}} a chassis dynamometer test in a laboratory. The total vehicle resistance of a vehicle, or 'road load', is simulated on the chassis dynamometer to obtain representative emissions. The road load of a vehicle is determined by means of a coast down test. As a large number of parameters and external conditions influence the coast down test, the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> <b>procedures</b> for performing the coast down test allow for certain margins within which certain test parameters should lie. These margins can partly explain the difference between the real-world and Type Approval CO 2 emissions.

40|$|AbstractHeavy {{commercial}} vehicle overloads contribute to premature deterioration of infrastructure and increase road unsafety and unfair competition between transport modes and operators. Public authorities and road operators must therefore implement an efficient checking system to enforce weights and dimensions at an affordable cost. A large scale project {{was launched in}} 2014 by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Sea, in charge of Transport, carried out by IFSTTAR and CEREMA, to demonstrate the feasibility of using high speed weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems for direct enforcement of overloaded HCVs. This ambitious challenge requires overcoming technological and metrological gaps, and modifying the current legislation. The required tolerances are ± 5 % for the gross vehicle weight, and ± 10 % for axle loads. None of the existing WIM system matches this accuracy for 100 % of the vehicles. Therefore {{the objective is to}} set up some sorting criteria and algorithms, eliminating the weighings outside these tolerances. The project is divided into 5 WPs, to characterize WIM sensor response under controlled environment and loading conditions and to develop fiber optic WIM sensors, to assess the capability of multiple sensor (MS-) and bridge (B-) WIM systems to meet the requirements, to carry long term road tests and to develop <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> for direct enforcement.

Euro 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 differ (beside vehicle preconditioning and warm-up procedures introduced since Euro 3) only because limits for the different pollutants have been progressively lowered. This paper analyses {{through a number of}} experimental tests on spark-ignition cars, a hybrid and a conventional vehicle, the driving conditions responsible for most of the emissions and assesses how such conditions are reproduced by the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test. The engine conditions mostly responsible for emissions are: warm-up phase, full loads and transients. Only the warm-up is well covered by the NEDC for vehicles with more than 35 kW/ton power-weight ratio. Tests performed with the Honda Hybrid (the low environmental impact vehicle) and with the Alfa Romeo 147 1. 6 (the conventional vehicle) showed how on the NEDC most emissions are produced in the warm up phase and are of the same order of magnitude for both cars while on more realistic driving cycles (ARTEMIS cycles have been used here) the capacity of the Hybrid to mitigate the transients effects results in a much lower emission rate. Full load conditions are not kept under control by the Hybrid as by the conventional vehicle when the O 2 exhaust sensor is disabled and the air-fuel ratio is no more stoichiometric. Even though this paper has not tested all possible vehicles types, it shows that European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedure</b> has some weaknesses in accounting for the main causes of vehicle emissions.

40|$|Interest in {{utilizing}} advanced lean-burn {{gasoline and}} diesel engines {{has increased in}} the last decades due to their reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased fuel economy. One impediment to {{the increasing use of}} these engines, however, is the need to develop corresponding catalytic systems for controlling pollutant emissions. In particular, although still far from the fuel neutral United States (US) approach, European (EU) legislation limits for Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions {{are becoming more and more}} severe and also <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedures</b> are going to radically change with the introduction of Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) and Real Driving Emission (RDE) tests. Considering that test bench and chassis dyno experimental campaigns are costly and require a vast use of resources for the generation of data; therefore, reliable and computationally efficient simulation models are essential in order to identify the most promising technology mix to satisfy emission regulations and fully exploit advantages of diesel and lean-burn gasoline when minimizing the side effect of their emissions. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop reliable models of the individual aftertreatment components and to calibrate the kinetic parameters based on experimental measurements which can be further used as a virtual test rig to evaluate the effectiveness of each technology in terms of reducing pollutant emissions. In the current work, a brief introduction regarding the passenger car emissions, regulations and control technologies, including in-cylinder control techniques and aftertreatment systems, is provided in Chapter 1. In addition, simulation modelling approaches for aftertreatment applications are discussed. More details about specific aftertreatment components are discussed in the next chapters. As an example, the modeling of a Selective Catalytic Reduction coated on Filter (SCR-F), on the basis of Synthetic Gas Bench (SGB) reactor data is presented in Chapter 2; focusing, in particular, on estimation of ammonia storage capacity, NOx conversion and soot reduction due to passive regeneration. LNT is analyzed in Chapter 3, focusing on the reactor-scale Synthetic Gas Bench (SGB) experiments and calibration of the 1 D simulation model for two case studies with the aim to characterize Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC), NOx Storage and Reduction (NSR) and light-off. The calibrated 1 D simulation model is thereafter validated, in Chapter 4, for one of the case studies using engine-out emissions, mass flowrate and temperature traces over Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) as the boundary condition for the inlet of LNT for full-size component. Afterwards, the LNT model calibrated in Chapter 3 is, in Chapter 5, further reduced and linearized with reasonable assumptions to be used as a plant-model with very low computational requirement and in real time applications such as Electronic Control Unit (ECU) / Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) systems. Finally, after discussing NOx control systems in previous chapters, modeling of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), which plays a fundamental role not only for the CO and HC conversion, but also for promoting the oxidation of NO into NO 2, is discussed in Chapter 6. It is worth noting that depending on the complexity of the kinetic model, different optimization tools are implemented for the calibration; as an example, Brent method is used for calibration of SCR-F kinetic model, likewise, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for the calibration of the DOC kinetic parameters; however, for more complex kinetic schemes like LNT both manual and automatic optimization is required to evaluate the most suitable reaction pathways and kinetic parameters. Accordingly, after development of the kinetic model for each aftertreatment component and validation of the full-scale model, further investigations could be devoted to combining the models in order to simulate the whole aftertreatment system and assess the performance over different driving cycles...|$|E

Various factors are discussed, including: (a) general testing methodologies; (b) road damage issues such as 'spatial repeatability' of dynamic tyre forces and road damage criteria; (c) vehicle response issues, such as test duration and sampling details, road roughness, testing speed, wheel-base filtering, tractor-trailer interaction, suspension maintenance and 'indirect' testing methods; and (d) implementation issues.

40|$|Pollutants {{emissions}} and fuel economy tests for passenger cars differ from region to {{region of the}} world, since different driving condition and vehicle fleet characterize different geographical areas. In particular, the European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedure</b> for passenger cars uses as reference cycle the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), which is nowadays not representative of real driving conditions. Therefore, the European Commission has planned to introduce the Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Test Procedure (WLTP) from September 2017. As a consequence, the CO 2 emissions target should be adapted, since the current 2020 goals are based on NEDC assessment. The European Commission and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) are therefore developing a simulation tool called CO 2 MPAS (CO 2 Module for Passenger and commercial vehicles Simulation) for the correlation of CO 2 emissions from WLTP to NEDC, which {{will be used for}} the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> of European passenger cars from 2017, avoiding expensive duplicate test campaigns for car manufactures. However, the implementation of CO 2 MPAS has so far involved solely conventional light duty vehicles.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new technology-oriented modelling approach {{for assessing the}} effect of different technologies and fleet composition on energy consumption/CO 2 emissions. The methodology follows a hybrid approach between a statistically founded instantaneous emission model and a complete vehicle-simulation model. It makes use of as limited information as possible referring mainly to already available data sources. It is split into two modules, the sampling module where individual vehicles are defined, each one corresponding to a real vehicle present in the fleet, and the simulation module where each vehicle is run in a predefined mission profile. The vehicle simulation model is based on simple longitudinal dynamics featuring an extended-Willans powertrain simulation module. The fleet “generator” module that selects and assigns vehicle characteristics per vehicle is based on existing databases and the annual CO 2 emissions monitoring database new vehicle registrations in the European market. The implementation code is built so that several thousands of simulations are possible in limited time.

To this aim, a new method for the calculation of the European light duty vehicle fleet CO 2 emissions, combining simulation at individual vehicle level with fleet composition data is adopted. The method builds on the work carried out in the development of CO 2 MPAS, the tool developed by the Joint Research Centre to allow the implementation of European Regulations 1152 and 1153 / 2017 (which set the conditions to amend the European CO 2 targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles due to the introduction of the WLTP in the European vehicle type-approval process). Results show an average WLTP to NEDC CO 2 emissions ratio in the range 1. 1 - 1. 4 depending on the powertrain and on the NEDC CO 2 emissions. In particular the ratio tends to be higher for vehicles with lower NEDC CO 2 emissions in all powertrains, the only exception being with the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In this case, indeed, the WLTP to NEDC CO 2 emissions ratio quickly decreases to values that can be also lower than 1 as the electric range of the vehicle increases. JRC.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the results of the effect of various fuel economy technologies on the certified CO 2 emissions of light duty vehicles. The vehicles operate under two different driving cycles, namely the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide harmonized Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP), which is considered closer to real world driving and {{is going to be the}} new <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test in the near future. The study focuses on the comparative evaluation of the effect of each technology on CO 2 emissions under these two driving cycles. To this aim, simulation models for a number of passenger cars were developed and validated against test data, generated via a specifically developed test protocol. In order to cover a large share of the market, the European fleet was divided into a number of segments based on specific vehicle characteristics and technologies, and representative vehicles for each segment were chosen. In order to minimize flexibilities and sources of uncertainty, the models were developed according to a standardized modelling procedure, based on the development of a reference “template model”. AVL's Cruise was used as simulation platform. The various components and modules for each vehicle model, as well as the respective input parameters, were defined with the support of the respective OEMs. After gaining confidence in the simulation models for all the vehicles considered in the present work, additional technologies, such as start-stop, brake energy recuperation and different drivetrain configurations, were implemented in each model. Specific strategies have been defined for the implementation of individual technologies and, where needed, additional algorithms were developed in Cruise. The results show that the effect of each technology on CO 2 emissions is different between NEDC and WLTP, owing to the different characteristics of each cycle. For example, the effect of start-stop on CO 2 emissions is larger in NEDC, due to longer idling periods compared to WLTP. In this context, the results of this study can provide useful indications for the most effective fuel economy technologies under the new <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

An onboard instrumentation able to communicate with the electronic system of the vehicle (OBD/CAN) was developed to collect all the sensor data installed on a vehicle: those values are used as input values to the emissions models of CO 2, CO, HC and NOx developed in the present work. The CO 2 and CO have been calculated using a chemical equilibrium combustion model with 6 combustion products, with the equilibrium temperature used as a calibration constant. HC and NOx, produced during transients, are assumed to be dependent from the accelerator pedal gradient, but during engine cold start also from the catalyst temperature. To validate the models, a spark ignition hybrid vehicle, the Honda Civic Hybrid has been tested on a chassis dynamometer running the three Artemis driving cycles. The emissions have been measured with the CVS (taken as reference) and with a portable emission analyzer, (Horiba OBS 1300), used for comparison with the models.

A comprehensive literature review is carried out, in which we examine the available information and aim to provide qualitative and quantitative data. Where information is e insufficient, we point out the gap in knowledge. In addition, we have examined by means of simulation the significance of several factors that may change during every-day operation and may depend either on the driver or on external conditions. Several factors were identified affecting the in-use fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions resulting in a shortfall between the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> and real-world values. These include the increased electrical power load (e. g. A/C, steering assist), aerodynamic alterations (roof box, aerofoils), ambient conditions (temperature, wind, rain and altitude), driving behavior (aggressive driving, driver training), vehicle condition (lubrication, tyre condition), increased vehicle mass (passengers, additional equipment), road conditions (road surface, traffic conditions). They are complemented by so-called "flexibilities" associated with the existing NEDC-based <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedure.</b> The combined effect of the different factors affecting CO 2 emissions,, although not fully cumulative, can result in shortfall values ranging between 25 % and 35 %, based on information collected, the calculations run and the assumptions adopted in this study. These figures {{are in line with}} other literature sources where shortfall ranges from 20 % up to 50 % compared to the official certification value are reported. The per-passenger CO 2 performance significantly improves when the occupancy rate is considered, hence a separate analysis was performed to this end. It can be concluded that due to the increase complexity of modern vehicles, the increasing number of passenger comfort systems and the great variety of possible operating conditions, it is difficult to capture the real-world fuel consumption with an exhaustive accuracy. It is expected that the introduction of the new test protocol (WLTP) will be a step forward in closing this shortfall. A separate analysis on the expected WLTP impact on CO 2 is presented. It cannot be overlooked that driver behavior is an important element and therefore additional measures, in particular proper driver training and information, can help to reduce the discrepancy observed by drivers between their own in-use CO 2 emissions from passenger cars compared to the test results.

Twenty gasoline and eleven diesel vehicles were tested on the current European TA procedure NEDC, and on the evolving WLTP. These WLTP tests were then used as base line to estimate for each vehicle a WLTP best case and a WLTP worst case scenario, in line with the finalized version of the WLTP. In the WLTP worst case scenario (WLTP-H) results showed CO 2 emissions and energy demands to be on average 11 % and 44 % higher than NEDC, respectively. Best case scenario (WLTP-L) has on average 1 % higher CO 2 emissions and 26 % higher energy requirements than the NEDC. These values should be considered on top of the 8 % average difference between the JRC NEDC test results and the official <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values. The higher vehicle inertia and road loads (RLs) along with the higher vehicle speeds, are the key parameters of the new procedure that contribute to the increased CO 2 emissions and vehicle energy demand (VED). Results from the present study show that moving from NEDC to WLTP have a stronger impact on diesel than on gasoline vehicles. The highest effect of WLTP introduction is measured for vehicles that comply with EURO 6 emission standard (14 % increase in CO 2 emissions from NEDC to the simulated worst case WLTP), with also the largest difference between JRC measured NEDC tests and declared <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values (11 % difference) ...|$|R

In the course of the development of WLTP, the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission has tested gaseous emissions of twenty-one Euro 4 – 6 gasoline and diesel vehicles, on both the current European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test <b>procedure</b> (NEDC) and the progressive versions of the WLTP. The results, which should be regarded just as an initial and qualitative indication of the trends, demonstrated minimal average differences between CO 2 emissions over the NEDC and WLTP. On the other hand, CO 2 emissions measured at JRC on the NEDC were on average 9 % higher than the respective <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values, therefore suggesting that for the tested vehicles, CO 2 emissions over WLTP were almost 10 % higher than the respective NEDC <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values. That difference is likely to increase with application of the full WLTP test procedure. Measured THC emissions from most vehicles stayed below the legal emission limits and in general were lower under the WLTP compared to NEDC. Moving from NEDC to WLTP did not have much impact on NOx from gasoline vehicles and CO from diesel vehicles. On the contrary, NOx from diesel vehicles and CO from low-powered gasoline vehicles were significantly higher over the more dynamic WLTP and in several cases exceeded the emission limits. Results from this study can be considered indicative of emission patterns of modern technology vehicles and useful to both policy makers and vehicle manufacturers in developing future emission policy/technology strategies.

40|$|The European Commission {{has been}} {{actively}} involved {{in the development of the}} World-wide harmonized Light duty Test Cycle (WLTC) and corresponding Test Procedure (WLTP), and is currently working to introduce them in the European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> (TA) <b>procedure.</b> The present study is analyzing and estimating effects of the introduction of WLTP on the average CO 2 emissions and average vehicle energy demands (VEDs) from different segments of the European vehicle market. Twenty gasoline and eleven diesel vehicles were tested on the current European TA procedure NEDC, and on the evolving WLTP. These WLTP tests were then used as basis to estimate for each vehicle a WLTP best case and a WLTP worst case, in line with the finalized version of the WLTP. In the WLTP worst case scenario (WLTP-H) results show on average 11 % higher CO 2 emissions and 44 % higher energy demands than NEDC. Best case scenario (WLTP-L) has on average 1 % higher CO 2 emissions and 26 % higher energy requirements than the NEDC. These values should be seen as additive to the 8 % average difference between the JRC NEDC test results and the official <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values. The higher vehicle inertia and road loads (RLs) along with the higher vehicle speeds, are the key parameters of the new procedure that contribute to the increased CO 2 emissions and vehicle energy demand (VED). Results from the present study seem to show that moving from NEDC to WLTP has a higher impact on diesel than on gasoline vehicles. The highest effect of WLTP introduction is measured for vehicles that comply with EURO 6 emission standard (14 % increase in CO 2 emissions from NEDC to the simulated worst case WLTP), with also the highest difference between JRC measured NEDC tests and declared <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values (11 % difference).

40|$|Regulated gaseous {{emissions}} from two Euro 3 motorcycles and three Euro 5 passenger cares were measured over different driving cycles. The {{purpose of this}} study was to get data on typical emission levels and patterns of motorcycles and passenger cars currently circulating on the road in Europe. In respect to this, three driving cycles were selected: the current <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> driving cycles used to certify the test vehicles for emissions (NEDC for passenger cars and the EDC for motorcycles) and the world-wide harmonized driving cycle for motorcycles (WMTC). The {{gaseous emissions}} (NOx, HC, CO and CO 2) were measured using the typical <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test <b>procedure</b> for light duty vehicles. Since all the vehicles tested had been certified using the relevant current legislative cycle (i. e. NEDC or EDC), these vehicles were clearly not optimized for the WMTC cycle. This means that the emissions measured over the WMTC may be considered closer to real world driving emissions allowing a more realistic comparison between the tested passenger cars and motorcycles. In addition to the emission bag-values, the second by second emission concentration values measured at the tailpipe outlet were recorded, allowing the analysis of the emission patterns and in particular of the importance of the cold start in respect to the distance specific emissions. In general, HC and CO emissions from the tested motorcycles resulted to be higher than the respective emission levels of the passenger car, while NOx emissions resulted to be dependent on the engine technology.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{and efficiency of}} Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are key topics to determine the usability and potential of electric vehicles in real-world, and the correct identification of the real-driving conditions is a key aspect to define effective <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> regulation for future vehicles. In this respect several aspects must be addressed, such as the representativeness of different test duty cycles versus real driving, the impact of different environmental conditions {{as well as the}} energy demand of auxiliaries in different operation conditions. In the last years the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has initiated pre-normative research on hybrid and battery electric vehicles, in order to support policy makers with independent expertise to define better and more representative EU <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test <b>procedures</b> for electrified vehicles, and harmonise the current reference EU regulation at global level in the framework of the activities of the UNECE. Among the several technical issues tackled, one aspect has involved the design of a test program and the set-up of a customisable, portable and lightweight on-board data logger capable to provide real-time synchronised measurements on the vehicle of all the relevant parameters, in order to accurately determine the fuel and energy {{consumption and}} the overall energy efficiency performance for both hybrid and battery electric vehicles. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present this instrument (i. e. PeMS, Portable energy Measurement System), its modular structure, its potential and its application in a comprehensive test campaign carried out in 2014 on a reference battery electric vehicle. Acquired data from the PeMS are compared with vehicle CANbus data, to assess the accuracy and potential of the instrument. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
40|$|Emissions {{testing in}} the {{laboratory}} forms {{an essential part of}} the European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>procedure</b> for light-duty vehicles. The approach yields reproducible and comparable results and provides clear design criteria for vehicles that have to comply with applicable emission limits. Although emission limits have become increasingly stringent in the past decade, road transport remains the most important source of urban air pollution with respect to nitrogen oxides (NOX) and carbon monoxide in Europe. Several studies have indicated that in particular on-road nitrogen oxide emissions of light-duty diesel vehicles might substantially exceed emission levels as identified in the laboratory. Here, we address this problem by using Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) to analyze the on-road emissions of 12 light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles on four test routes, representing rural, urban, uphill/downhill, and motorway driving. The results indicate that average NOX emissions of diesel vehicles (0. 93 ± 0. 39 g/km), including Euro 5 diesel vehicles (0. 62 ± 0. 19 g/km), substantially exceed the respective emission limits. The observed deviations range from a factor of 4 - 7 for NOX emission averages over entire test routes up to a factor of 14 for NOX emissions of individual averaging windows. By comparison, on-road NOX emissions of gasoline vehicles as well as CO (carbon monoxide) and THC (total hydrocarbon) emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles generally stay within Euro 3 - 5 emission limits. The tested light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles emit during on-road testing on average 189 ± 51 g CO 2 /km (grams carbon dioxide per kilometre) and 162 ± 29 g CO 2 /km, respectively, thereby exceeding the CO 2 emissions as specified during laboratory testing by on average 21 ± 9 %. The cold-start emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles span over a large value range; NOX emissions exceed Euro 3 - 5 emission limits by a factor 2 - 14, CO emissions often exceed emission limits, and THC emissions are both below and above Euro 3 - 5 emission limits, respectively. The PEMS equipment is reliable and provides accurate emission measurements. PEMS are able to verify the proper operation of emission control technologies under a wide variety of normal operating conditions as well as test emissions from novel fuel/engine/after-treatment/powertrain technologies (e. g., parallel/serial (plug-in) hybrid vehicles. The PEMS procedure for light-duty vehicles is, however, relatively new and requires further refinement before being applied at large scale. The findings of this report indicate that the current laboratory emissions testing fails to capture the wide range of potential on-road emissions. A promising remedy for this problem may be attained by supplementing the laboratory test with complementary emission test procedures such as PEMS on-road testing. This report provides a first step into that direction, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive EU policy that assures compliance of light-duty vehicles with emission limits under normal conditions of use.

40|$|Vehicle <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> CO 2 {{emission}} figures {{form the}} basis for many countries’ national policy to reduce transport's contribution to anthropogenic climate change. However, it has become increasingly apparent that the vehicle <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> testing <b>procedure</b> used in Europe is not fit for purpose. There is, therefore, a need for representative real world emission factors {{that can be used to}} inform consumers, aid policy makers and provide an accurate benchmark from which <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> figures can be compared. In this work, two methods are explored to assess their feasibility to provide robust CO 2 emission figures. The first is on-road vehicle activity tracking, using data collected from the vehicle controller area network. This method was chosen as it has the potential to provide large quantities of cheap, reliable data and has been demonstrated by recording over 40 parameters during testing of a third-generation Toyota Prius. This data has been used to analyse the vehicle powertrain control and provide a clear understanding of the control mechanisms that balance the engine and electrical power systems, present a comparison of the emissions of conventional and hybrid taxis giving local policy makers the underlying evidence required to introduce strong policies to reduce urban emissions from taxis and build a microscale emission model for accurate and detailed emission forecasts. The second method is microscale vehicle modelling, defined as very short time step models (1 second or less) that capture vehicle and location specific details within the model. The model requires vehicle speed and road gradient data as input and outputs second-by-second cumulative and total fuel consumed and CO 2 emissions. The model has been validated against independent data (chassis dynamometer data collected by Argonne National Laboratory) and is now a powerful tool to help assess the effects of local policies (geofences, changes in the speed limit, incentives for hybrid vehicle uptake) or schemes (eco-driving) on the CO 2 emissions from hybrid vehicles. This work has further developed these two methods in two ways. Firstly, by demonstrating the accuracy of controller area network data collected in vehicle activity tracking. Secondly, by demonstrating the precision of emission models built using real-world data, despite the data noise caused by real world conditions. In conclusion, these methods are well suited to providing representative real world CO 2 emission factors, especially if the methods are combined. This is because vehicle activity tracking can provide the large amount of data needed for vehicle modelling and a vehicle model can provide situation specific emission factors, which, in contrary to many current emissions factors, are not only dependent on vehicle average speeds. ...|$|R
