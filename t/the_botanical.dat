50|$|In contrast, {{the spirit}} {{derived from the}} Carter-Head still is much subtler with light floral and sweet fragrances. Its method of {{production}} is quite different, with only the neutral spirit and water added to the pot of this still. All <b>botanicals</b> used with <b>the</b> Carter-Head are added to a flavour basket {{at the very top}} of the still. Rather than boiling <b>the</b> <b>botanicals,</b> which produces <b>the</b> strong pungent spirit of the Bennett still, the Carter-Head bathes <b>the</b> <b>botanicals</b> in <b>the</b> alcohol vapours only. As these rise up through the still, they enter the base of <b>the</b> <b>botanicals</b> basket. Inside, <b>the</b> <b>botanicals</b> are contained in copper baskets, which hold them together while allowing the vapours to be fully exposed. As the evaporated alcohol moves through <b>the</b> <b>botanicals</b> it efficiently extracts flavours from them, which are carried out of the basket along with the alcohol until they reach the condenser. Only the lighter, sweeter and floral flavours are able to be extracted by this method, which gives the spirit its distinctive character.|$|R

5|$|Robinson {{began his}} garden work {{at an early}} age, as a garden boy for the Marquess of Waterford at Curraghmore, County Waterford. From there, {{he went to the}} estate of an Irish baronet in Ballykilcavan, County Laois, Sir Hunt Johnson-Walsh, and was put in charge {{of a large number of}} {{greenhouses}} at the age of 21. According to one account, as the result of a bitter quarrel, one cold winter night in 1861 he let the fires go out, killing many valuable plants. Other accounts consider the story to be a gross exaggeration. Whether in haste after the greenhouse incident or not, Robinson left for Dublin in 1861, where the influence of David Moore, head of <b>the</b> <b>botanical</b> garden at Glasnevin, a family friend, helped him find work at <b>the</b> <b>Botanical</b> Gardens of Regent's Park, London, where he was given responsibility for the hardy herbaceous plants, specialising in British wildflowers.|$|E
5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside <b>the</b> <b>botanical</b> fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
