40|$|AbstractGiven a data {{structure}} and an ordering on the objects it contains, we study methods for obtaining a modified {{data structure}} <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> splits and concatenations {{with respect to}} that ordering. A general technique will be given, which works for all data structures for decomposable searching problems and order decomposable set problems. Furthermore, the results imply a new method for adding range restrictions to data structures. Applications include, e. g., a version of an interval tree <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> splitting and concatenating {{on the length of}} the intervals, a version of the d-dimensional k-d tree <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> splitting and concatenating on all coordinates, and a data structure on points in the plane <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> reporting the convex hull of the points in a given query rectangle...|$|R
5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> identification of disposable garbage.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect can}} also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass) or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism. It {{is due to the}} {{influence}} of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body's gravity (encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations). Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|In dressage, the Finnhorse is able {{to compete}} with warmbloods up to {{national}} levels, and in lower levels it has the upper hand because it can easily perform the required movements, and has smoother gaits <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> ease of riding. In 2010, a Finnhorse medaled in international paraequestrian dressage competition. In higher level dressage, the breed however it is hindered by its less-flashy movement, restricted by a somewhat upright shoulder. Despite this there are successful dressage horses, {{and a number of}} Finnhorses even earn their keep with their dressage winnings, a notable achievement as competing in Finland is expensive and prize money low. Most Finnhorses used in dressage compete at the national 4th level (US) or Grade IV (GB), though some individuals have competed at the Prix de St. Georges level.|$|E
