5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|HB 3466 {{would have}} {{increased}} penalties {{for possession of}} under an ounce of marijuana from an infraction (traffic ticket-like offense) to a Class A misdemeanor, the worst non-felony offense, with a fine of $100 to $1,000 per gram, up {{to a maximum of}} $5,000. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> would have created a new crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The bill would have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, Wilberforce leased a {{house in}} Old Palace Yard, Westminster, {{in order to be}} near Parliament. He began using his {{parliamentary}} position to advocate reform by introducing a Registration Bill, proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures. He brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists, arsonists and thieves. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> advocated the reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason, a crime that at the time included a husband's murder. The House of Commons passed both bills, but they were defeated in the House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.|$|E
5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch {{was to leave}} the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green {{before coming to the}} surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was to connect to the DR. The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E
50|$|Todd Collins {{started at}} quarterback for <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> {{in their first}} season in the post-Jim Kelly era. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>also</b> signed Oakland's Billy Joe Hobert to {{challenge}} Collins for the starting job.

50|$|During 2008 and 2009, Aronberg helped pass anti-gang {{legislation}}.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>also</b> {{picked up}} former Chargers quarterback Jack Kemp off the waiver wire. Kemp had a broken hand, {{and as such}} could not play until the twelfth game of the season, but he {{would prove to be}} <b>the</b> best <b>Bills</b> quarterback of <b>the</b> 1960s.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a way to meet the state's Medicaid obligations and whether or not to raise the minimum dropout age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed care plans did not generate sufficient savings. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the managed care plans. Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>also</b> guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court. Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. This {{was the first time in}} American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary to override a presidential veto. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
