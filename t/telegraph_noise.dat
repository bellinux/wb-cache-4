40|$|SRAM is {{vulnerable}} to device-to-device variation (DDV), since it uses minimum-sized devices and requires device matching. In addition to the as-fabricated DDV at time-zero, aging induces a time-dependent DDV (TDDV). Bias temperature instability (BTI) is a dominant aging process. A number of techniques {{have been developed to}} characterize the BTI, including the conventional pulse-(I) -(V), random <b>telegraph</b> <b>noises,</b> time-dependent defect spectroscopy, and TDDV accounting for the within-device fluctuation. These techniques, however, cannot be directly applied to SRAM, because their test conditions do not comply with typical SRAM operation. The central objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a technique suitable for characterizing both the negative BTI (NBTI) and positive BTI (PBTI) in SRAM. The key issues addressed include the SRAM relevant sensing Vg, measurement delay, capturing the upper envelope of degradation, sampling rate, and measurement time window. The differences between NBTI and PBTI are highlighted. The impact of NBTI and PBTI on the cell-level performance is assessed by simulation, based on experimental results obtained from individual devices. The simulation results show that, for a given static noise margin, test conditions have a significant effect on the minimum operation bias...|$|R

40|$|Vertical and {{in-plane}} electrical transport in InAs/InP semiconductors nanostructures —mainly {{wires and}} dots, Fig. 1 — {{have been investigated}} by conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) [1] and electrical measurements at low temperatures in processed devices. Spatially resolved current images and localized I-V curves are obtained with C-AFM technique in a controlled atmosphere at room temperature and provide information about vertical transport across the nanostructures. The devices were processed by electron-beam lithography in order to access the in-plane conductance of an assembly with a reduced number of nanostructures.

Due to the unpredictabili-ty of the physical phenomenon, RTN is a good randomness source for true random number generators (TRNG). In this paper, we build fundamental randomness models for TRNGs based on single trap- and multiple traps-induced RTN. We theoretically derive the autocorrelation coefficient, bias, and bit rate for RTN-based TRNGs. Two representative RTN-based TRNG schemes are simulated to verify the proposed randomness models. An oscillator-based TRNG is also studied based on the theoretical randomness model of multiple traps-induced RTN. We also provide basic guidelines for designing RTN-based TRNGs.
