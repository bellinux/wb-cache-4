5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} a statement of intention rather than a binding contract. The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period. The main cause of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of socioeconomic-cultural homogamy on the marital and sexual satisfaction of Hong Kong Chinese couples. Using a representative, territory-wide sample of 1, 083 first-time married heterosexual couples, this study found that wives were generally less satisfied than <b>their</b> husbands <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marital and sexual relationships. Husbands <b>were</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marriages when they <b>were</b> two <b>to</b> four years older than their wives than when they were of similar age to their wives (i. e., within one year of each other), but they <b>were</b> less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marriages when only their wives were employed than when both partners were employed. In addition, they <b>were</b> less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied <b>with</b> both <b>their</b> marital and sexual relationships when their wives were five or more years older. Wives with an older husband <b>were</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sexually satisfied than wives {{of the same age}} as their husband, but they <b>were</b> less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> marriages when they were better educated than their husbands.

During the major Muslim religious occasions of Eid, the university is usually deserted as students go home <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> families. Other religiously important days like Shabe-barat are observed through discussions and religious activities. The major Hindu festival celebrated in the university is Saraswati Puja—Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, is worshiped in a central location as well as individually in many residential halls. The Bengali new year, Pohela Baisakh is also observed with much pomp.|$|E
25|$|In early 1963, Jacqueline {{was again}} pregnant, leading her to curtail her {{official}} duties. She {{spent most of}} the summer at a home {{she and her husband had}} rented on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7, five weeks ahead of her scheduled Caesarean section, she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. His lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> infant son, and was present at his death. He returned to Otis on August 14 to take her home, giving an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen that had gathered in her suite, and she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.|$|E

25|$|The Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 {{stopped the}} {{issuance}} of passports to Japanese laborers trying to go to America or Hawaii. However, there was a loophole in the agreement that allowed wives and children to immigrate <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> husbands and fathers. It was because of this loophole that so many picture brides were able to immigrate to Hawaii and the United States. The impact of the Gentlemen's Agreement {{is evident in the}} population percentage of men and women before and after it was issued. For example, 86.7 percent of Japanese admitted to U.S. prior to Gentlemen's Agreement were men, after the agreement only 41.6 percent of the Japanese admitted were men. The spread of the Japanese people grew so rapidly that, in 1897, the Japanese were known as the largest single ethnic group in Hawai'i, consisting of 40 percent of the population by the year 1900. Between 1907 and 1923 14,276 Japanese picture brides and 951 Korean picture brides arrived in Hawaii. Between 1908 and 1920 over 10,000 picture brides arrived on the West Coast of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Tina Brown {{was born}} in Maidenhead, England, {{and she and her}} elder brother, Christopher Hambley Brown (who became a movie producer) grew up in Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, a Thames village in the {{countryside}} west of London. Her father, George Hambley Brown, was active in the British film industry producing the early Miss Marple films in the series starring Margaret Rutherford, based on the character created by Agatha Christie. His other films included The Chiltern Hundreds (1949); Hotel Sahara (1951), starring Yvonne De Carlo; Guns at Batasi (1964), starring Richard Attenborough and Mia Farrow. In 1939, he had an early marriage to the actress Maureen O'Hara; according to O'Hara, it was never consummated, owing to her parents' intervention, and it was annulled. George later met and married Brown's mother, Bettina Iris Mary (Kohr), who was an assistant to Laurence Olivier. Brown's mother was of part Iraqi descent; she recounted, “She was dark and I never knew why.” In her later years, Bettina wrote for an English-language magazine for expatriates in Spain where she and her husband lived in retirement until moving to New York in the early eighties <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> daughter and grandchildren.|$|E

500|$|Much {{of daily}} life inside the gaol could be gleaned from sources such as diaries written by John Castieau, {{governor}} of the gaol between 1869 and 1884. [...] During its operation, the gaol was used to house short-term prisoners, lunatics {{and some of the}} colony’s most notorious and hardened criminals. It also housed up to twenty children at a time – including those imprisoned for petty theft or vagrancy, or simply those staying with a convicted parent. [...] Babies under twelve months old were allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mothers. [...] The youngest prisoner was recorded as three-year-old Michael Crimmins, who spent 6 months in the prison in 1857 for being idle and disorderly. [...] In 1851, the 13- and 14-year-old O'Dowd sisters were imprisoned because they had nowhere else to go.|$|E
500|$|The {{narrator of}} the song worries that the girl he is {{addressing}} will ignore him because {{he has nothing to}} give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980syoung students and workerswere also suffering from not having resources to marry, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex. [...] The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will [...] "grab her hands" [...] ("") and then she will go with him (""), he suggests in the end that she can love {{the fact that he has}} nothing (""). On one level, this suggests that the song is about [...] "love conquering all", but the line has also been interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and [...] "Dionysian" [...] mix of love and aggression.|$|E

One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience.

I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> guy," [...] she added.|$|E
