Both the FBI and <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Homeland</b> <b>Security</b> expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E

Special precautions were taken because many of the events were open to the public and there were multiple protectees.

Members of the United States Department of Homeland Security laid out the groundwork for the initial drill in February 2004. In May 2005, 5,000volunteers participated in the $1million evacuation drill, which included mock explosions. A goal of the drill was to test the response of 49western Pennsylvania emergency agencies. In April 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Homeland</b> <b>Security</b> worked in conjunction with the United States Coast Guard to develop a plan of response for the 2006 All-Star Game.

5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Homeland</b> <b>Security</b> to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Homeland</b> <b>Security</b> {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E

5|$|The Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry {{declared}} a State of Emergency in 17counties {{and described the}} outbreak as the worst natural disaster he had seen since becoming governor. On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20. Homeowners were allowed to borrow $200,000 to repair damages to their home or find a temporary or permanent shelter. They were also allowed to borrow up to $40,000 to replace lost property. Businesses were allowed to borrow up to $2million for damage repair, property loss, and economic loss. By February23, about $781,000 had been given in federal grants. On February 25, FEMA approved Governor Henry's request for public assistance in Carter, Coal and Love counties. The estimated cost to clear the 7,000 tons of debris in Lone Grove was placed at $500,000, of which $90,000 has been paid for by FEMA. <b>The</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Homeland</b> <b>Security</b> offered to assist with the reconstruction of homes and businesses and to support those who were left homeless.
