Noether's theorem allows these quantities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry.

5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of stars occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined.</b>|$|E
