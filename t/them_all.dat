5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America.

Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping <b>them</b> <b>all</b> in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
