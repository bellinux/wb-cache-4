5|$|Unlike both horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005)which {{were also}} {{produced}} by Bay, Form, and Fullerit was decided <b>that</b> <b>Friday</b> the 13th {{would not be}} a period piece.

Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel.

Principal photography began on April 21, 2008, in Austin, Texas, and finished on June 13, 2008.|$|E
