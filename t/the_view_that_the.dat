5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee was of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
50|$|Fourteen {{prominent}} Anglicans, including Badeley and Henry Edward Manning, {{called upon}} the Church of England to repudiate <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council had expressed on baptism.

5|$|As a Justice, Black held <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court should {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, {{especially the}} First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ {{because of his}} willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E
5|$|As some archaeological records support <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian {{state was}} divided during Peribsen's reign, there is {{continued}} debate {{as to why}} his predecessors decided to divide the realm, and whether Peribsen ruled part or all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Despite growing {{pressure}} for his deposition, Stigand continued {{to attend the}} royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester. His intransigence towards the papacy was used as propaganda by Norman advocates of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English church was backward and needed reform.|$|E
25|$|Rousseau {{generally}} opposed <b>the</b> Enlightenment thrust <b>that</b> {{was occurring}} during his lifetime. He sought {{to distance himself}} philosophically from <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> universal use of reason, science, uninhibited freedom of thought, and increasing appreciation for the fine arts would make society a better place. Rousseau is often characterized {{as the father of}} Romanticism, as he opposed modernity and the Enlightenment and glorified the heroic ethos of Ancient Rome and Greece.|$|R

2500|$|Street {{children}} in India are frequently exposed to abuse and extortion. Because {{they have no}} social status and no adults to protect them, street children identify being physically threatened and intimidated by adults as <b>the</b> one factor <b>that</b> contributes most to the misery of living on the streets. The primary cause for this treatment is <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police and general public hold toward them: most scorn them and react to them with hostility.|$|R
5|$|Other scholars, however, {{argue that}} {{hereditary}} illegitimacy is not listed among the indiscretions of the Wicked Priest, {{and that this}} interpretation has been foisted upon the text by decades of questionable interpretation. Collins argues further {{that there is no}} evidence in the Community Rule or the Damascus Document to support <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Qumran community was concerned with the legitimacy of a non-Zadokite High Priest.|$|E
5|$|The killings shocked both Northern Ireland and Ireland and put {{a serious}} strain on Anglo-Irish relations.

More cautiously, it argues that limited doxastic voluntarism is (or would be) a useful capacity for agents concerned with truth tracking to possess, and that having it would confer some straightforward benefits of both an epistemic and non-epistemic variety to an agent concerned with truth tracking...|$|R

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked to <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events {{were thought to}} have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years.

However, {{there is evidence that}} two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the History means they cannot have been written by the same author.|$|E

50|$|In addition, Han has collaborated {{actively}} {{with many}} Chinese sociologists, {{particularly with the}} research groups of Tsinghua University to {{lay the foundation for}} a theory of second-modern transformation in East Asia.

5|$|In 2008, Triumph International {{came under}} fire after a female {{president}} of a local union was dismissed in Thailand. She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T-shirt on which a political statement could be seen. The company's management had <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> appearance had harmed their public image and therefore laid off the staff member in question. The international work council of the company, Triumph International Labor Union, protested and collected 2,500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president, supported in solidarity in Germany, inter alia, by the ver.di youth. In November 2008, the Labor Court in Bangkok found the lay-off to have been lawful.|$|E

During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where they questioned his arming the Asháninka, because of <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded that the Church had resorted {{to the use of}} violence in the past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E
5|$|Johann Georg Wagler {{gave the}} species its current {{binomial}} name in 1832 when he erected the new genus Eudocimus, whose only other species is the scarlet ibis (E.ruber). There {{has long been}} debate on whether the two should be considered subspecies or closely related species, and the American Ornithologists' Union considers the two to be a superspecies as they are parapatric. The lack of observed hybrids was a large factor in <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species were separate.|$|E

5|$|Most historians share <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> militants {{escalated}} {{the conflict}} toward {{violence on the}} basis of false information transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting to neutralize the nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial attacks have stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of the militants in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible for the movement and responded by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E

5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{is the use}} {{of executive}} power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national interest.
