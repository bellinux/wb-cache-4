5|$|Andjar's {{screenplay}} Dr Samsi {{was finally}} adapted {{as a film}} in 1952 by Ratna Asmara, who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 film Sedap Malam (Sweetness of the Night). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In 1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival, which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew) and Lilik Sudjio's Tarmina. Critics wrote that Lewat Djam Malam was easily the stronger of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> suggested that Djamaluddin Malik, Tarmina producer, had influenced the jury's decision.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match more {{effectively}} of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> scored what {{proved to be}} the winning goal in the latter minutes of the first half – Freddie Ljungberg's rebounded goal effort was converted by Robert Pirès. Midway through the second half, Southampton goalkeeper Antti Niemi was substituted, as he strained his calf muscle; he was replaced by Paul Jones. In stoppage time, striker James Beattie had his header cleared off the line by Ashley Cole, in what was the final chance for Southampton.|$|E
5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> <b>and</b> fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

She was also carrying multiple mobile phones, as well as a laptop.

5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with it. Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. S. przewalskii is also the smaller of <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> <b>and</b> its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E

Gay's older sister, Tiffany, was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career. Tiffany and Tyson Gay, encouraged by their mother, raced at every opportunity, training hard at school and on the hills in their neighborhood.

5|$|Džakula and Ećimović were sacked {{from their}} {{government}} positions, {{and from the}} positions of regional authority in the RSK-held western Slavonia. The other three RSK signatories were dismissed from their official posts as well. At local elections held in May 1993 to fill the vacated posts, Džakula was elected {{to serve as the}} Mayor of Pakrac municipality. On 21 September, Džakula and Ećimović were arrested, and taken to Knin prison and then to Glina while the investigation was in progress. On 3 December, they were released only to learn that the arrest of <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> <b>and</b> Kulić, was ordered days later. In order to evade the arrest, the three fled the RSK to Serbia. On 4 February 1994, Džakula was abducted in Belgrade by the RSK agents and taken back to the RSK.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald and Ymme had a daughter, Eanswith (who {{founded the}} very first nunnery on English soil at Folkestone, 15 miles from Canterbury), and two sons, Eorcenberht and Eormenred.

5|$|Graeme Le Saux and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink {{were passed}} fit for Chelsea, but John Terry was {{omitted from the}} {{starting}} lineup, having woken up ill {{on the morning of}} the final. For Arsenal, goalkeeper David Seaman came in place of Richard Wright, who deputised for him in the earlier rounds of the competition. Chelsea were led onto the field by Roberto Di Matteo, who had been forced to retire from football earlier in the season due to a serious injury. After an uneventful first half, Chelsea settled much the quicker of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> created several chances to score. Arsenal withstood the pressure and took the lead in the 70th minute, when Ray Parlour scored from 25 yards. They made sure of victory after Fredrik Ljungberg scored from a similar distance.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Pablo Jayat {{and colleagues}} {{reviewed}} {{the members of}} the Akodon boliviensis group in Argentina. On the basis of sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, they found A.caenosus to be closest to A.lutescens and A.subfuscus, forming a clade that was the sister group to a clade of the remaining species in the A.boliviensis group—A.boliviensis, A.spegazzinii, A.sylvanus, and A.polopi. They classified A.caenosus as a species separate from A.lutescens because the two forms did not form a single clade (A.caenosus was instead closer to A.subfuscus), and because the difference between the cytochrome b sequences of A.lutescens and A.caenosus was relatively high at 3.5%. A.aliquantulus was reduced to a synonym of A.caenosus, because they found no substantial morphometrical differentiation between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> could not replicate the characters Díaz and colleagues had noted as diagnostic for A.aliquantulus.|$|E

5|$|In 580 or 581, Mundhir {{participated in}} an {{unsuccessful}} campaign against the Persian capital, Ctesiphon, alongside the Byzantine general (and future emperor) Maurice. The failure of the campaign led to a quarrel between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> Maurice accused Mundhir of treason. Byzantine agents captured Mundhir, who was brought to Constantinople but never faced trial. His arrest provoked an uprising among the Ghassanids under Mundhir's son al-Nu'man VI.

5|$|In a 1980 article, Argentine {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{recognized the}} resemblance between Winge's Hesperomys molitor and Hershkovitz's Holochilus magnus, and {{recommended that the}} former be reclassified as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus molitor. When American zoologists Voss and Carleton restudied Winge's material in a 1993 paper, {{they were unable to}} find any consistent differences between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>and</b> accordingly considered them to pertain to the same species. In addition, they reviewed the differences between this species and other Holochilus and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named Lundomys after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as Lundomys molitor.|$|E
