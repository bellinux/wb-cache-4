Solid wooden doors were insulated with rubber and bolted from the outside by heavy cross-bars.|$|E
2500|$|In some {{locations}} any metal can, even aluminium, {{might be}} called a [...] "tin can". [...] Use of aluminium in cans began in 1957. Aluminium is less costly than <b>tin-plated</b> steel but offers the same resistance to corrosion in addition to greater malleability, resulting in ease of manufacture; this gave rise to the two-piece can, where all but the top of the can is simply stamped out of a single piece of aluminium, rather than laboriously constructed from three pieces of steel.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1897, after {{reports of}} {{excessive}} chamber pressures and short barrel life (3,000 rounds) despite {{the use of}} 4.5 percent nickel-steel barrels, the specifications for the 6mm round were changed to incorporate a [...] round-nosed lead-core bullet with a copper jacket, which was then <b>tin-plated</b> to prevent corrosion from salt air. [...] Winchester and UMC had difficulty in achieving the pressure limit specification (43,000 psi) for the new loading with Rifleite, and chamber pressures varied widely from lot to lot of powder, ranging up to 60,000 psi. The new M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun was also modified to accept the new [...] loading the same year, and a further 500,000 cartridges were ordered to accommodate machine-gun usage.|$|E
60|$|But at {{that moment}} the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house. The odour which now filled the {{refectory}} was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in two huge <b>tin-plated</b> vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day's fare would be like this.|$|E

5000|$|Tin bonds {{readily to}} iron {{and is used}} for coating lead, zinc and steel to prevent corrosion. <b>Tin-plated</b> steel {{containers}} are widely used for food preservation, and this forms {{a large part of}} the market for metallic tin. A tinplate canister for preserving food was first manufactured in London in 1812. Speakers of British English call them [...] "tins", while speakers of American English call them [...] "cans" [...] or [...] "tin cans". One derivation of such use is the slang term [...] "tinnie" [...] or [...] "tinny", meaning [...] "can of beer". The tin whistle is so called because it was first mass-produced in <b>tin-plated</b> steel.|$|E
50|$|Bezalel {{pavilion}} was a <b>tin-plated</b> wooden {{structure with}} a crenelated roof and tower built outside Jaffa Gate in 1912. It was a shop and showroom for Bezalel souvenirs. The pavilion was demolished by the British authorities six years later.|$|E

50|$|François Villette (1621- 1698) was an engineer, {{optician}} {{and fireworks}} {{expert at the}} court of Louis XIV of France. An early demonstrator of the potential of solar energy technology, he designed a <b>tin-plated</b> bronze mirror, almost one meter in diameter, which he used to reflect the sun’s rays onto objects which melted from the high temperatures produced. It was demonstrated with great effect at the court of Versailles.|$|E
50|$|Flat {{flexible}} circuits {{are able}} to fold into nearly any shape due to their flexibility and smaller size. Although they are small and light-weight, they are durable and capable of handling high density. Materials in flat flexible circuits include bare copper, <b>tin-plated</b> copper, acrylic, pressure sensitive adhesives, polyester, photoinduced electron transfer, polyethylene naphthalate, tin, conductive silver ink, and aluminum or copper tape. Typical applications of flat flexible circuits include plotters, copiers, and printers.|$|E

To make distribution easier, two <b>tin-plated,</b> iron cups attached to the fountain by a small chain were at the drinker's desire, staying always submerged for more cleanliness. These cups were removed in 1952 [...] "for Hygiene reasons" [...] by demand of the Council of Public Hygiene of the old Department of the Seine.|$|E
5000|$|Terminal strip construction, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses terminal strips (also called [...] "tag boards"). A terminal strip has stamped <b>tin-plated</b> copper terminals, each with a hole through which wire ends could be pushed, fitted on an insulating strip, usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an integral mounting bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.|$|E
50|$|The clamps of the {{grounding}} kits / earthing kits {{are composed}} of an ozone- and UV-resistant rubber coat with a device where the ripple can be lodged. The <b>tin-plated</b> ripple with a special alloying enables the bridging over big tolerances between kit and coaxial cable which is important for a best possible voltage transmission. The ripple to the skinned coaxial cable has a low contact resistance between 0.10 to 0.15 mΩ. It also enables a better length compensation as well as even and low contact pressures, which avoids damages on the coaxial cable. These characteristics are known as relaxation behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Punched <b>tin-plated</b> steel, {{also called}} pierced tin, is an artisan {{technique}} originating in central Europe for creating housewares {{that are both}} functional and decorative. Decorative piercing designs exist in a wide variety, based on local tradition and the artisan's personal creations. Punched tin lanterns {{are the most common}} application of this artisan technique. The light of a candle shining through the pierced design creates a decorative light pattern in the room where it sits. Lanterns and other punched tin articles were created in the New World from the earliest European settlement. A well-known example is the Revere lantern, named after Paul Revere.|$|E
5000|$|A {{kerosene}} lantern, {{also known}} as a [...] "barn lantern" [...] or [...] "hurricane lantern," [...] is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use. They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet metal stampings, with <b>tin-plated</b> sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper. There are three types: Dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast. Both hot blast and cold blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead flame lamps as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds.|$|E
50|$|Electroplating {{changes the}} chemical, physical, and {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} workpiece. An example of a chemical change is when nickel plating improves corrosion resistance. An example of a physical change {{is a change in}} the outward appearance. An example of a mechanical change is a change in tensile strength or surface hardness which is a required attribute in tooling industry.Electroplating of acid gold on underlying copper/nickel-plated circuits reduces contact resistance as well as surface hardness. Copper-plated areas of mild steel act as a mask if case hardening of such areas are not desired. <b>Tin-plated</b> steel is chromium-plated to prevent dulling of the surface due to oxidation of tin.|$|E
50|$|Most {{auditing}} sessions {{employ a}} device called the Hubbard Electropsychometer or E-meter. This device is a custom electrodermal activity measurement device. It measures {{changes in the}} electrical resistance of the preclear by passing a small electric current (typically {{in the range from}} 50 µA to 120 µA) through the preclear's body by means of a pair of <b>tin-plated</b> tubes originally much like empty soup cans, attached to the meter by wires and held by the preclear during auditing. These changes in electrical resistance are believed by Scientologists to be a reliable and a precise indication of changes in the reactive mind of the preclear.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] This dummy {{cartridge}} uses {{a modified}} case bearing the headstamp F A 4 09 indicating manufacture at Frankford Arsenal in April 1909. The {{case has been}} <b>tin-plated,</b> indented with six longitudinal corrugations, and perforated three times in alternating indentations. The hollow brass bullet retains a spring-loaded steel rod exposed in the primer pocket with 1/8-inch of possible forward movement when struck by the firing pin. This rod is intended to slow forward motion of the firing pin (similarly to striking a live primer) to avoid breaking the firing pin by the abrupt stop within the bolt if no resistance was encountered within the chamber.|$|E
5000|$|An {{unconfirmed}} {{number of}} 601s launched prior to August 1997 have a design flaw in their SCPs, where a <b>tin-plated</b> relay forms crystalline [...] "whiskers" [...] under certain specific conditions. These whiskers eventually caused an electrical short. Each satellite contains two SCPs and the backup unit will take {{control in the}} event of a failure of the primary unit. In some cases, both SCPs have failed, rendering the spacecraft unusable. A notable example was the Galaxy IV satellite. At least eight 601s have experienced SCP failures; four of which were double failures resulting in total loss of the satellite. Hughes switched to nickel plating on later 601s to resolve this problem, at the expense of payload weight.|$|E
5000|$|In electroplating, {{the item}} to be coated is placed into a {{container}} containing {{a solution of}} one or more tin salts. The item is connected to an electrical circuit, forming the cathode (negative) of the circuit while an electrode typically of the same metal to be plated forms the anode (positive). When an electric current is passed through the circuit, metal ions in the solution are attracted to the item. To produce a smooth, shiny surface, the electroplated sheet is then briefly heated above the melting point of tin. Most of the <b>tin-plated</b> steel made today is then further electroplated with a very thin layer of chromium to prevent dulling of the surface from oxidation of the tin.|$|E
