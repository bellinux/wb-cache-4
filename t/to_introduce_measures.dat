Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures {{to increase the number}} of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.|$|E
25|$|Goldberg was {{appointed}} Chief Executive of the London Jewish Forum in July 2008, having been the Community Issues Director at the Board of Deputies of British Jews. In June 2007, Goldberg {{was involved in}} trying to find a solution to a crisis in the orthodox Jewish community over marriage visas. The Home Office proposed <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> that would raise the age limit for international marriage visas from 18 to 21, which would impact on the strictly orthodox community. He was part of a delegation that met with the immigration minister in March 2008 to express their concerns over the proposal.|$|E
25|$|Lépine is {{credited}} as {{the founder of}} modern French policing. At {{the time of his}} first tenure the police had become renowned for corruption and low standards, trust between the police and the public was very low. Lépine recognised that if France was not to relapse into military government the relationship between the civil police and the public had to change to become one of mutual trust. The assassination in Lyon in June 1894 of President Carnot, the 5th President of the Republic was the impetus for Lépine <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> to overhaul policing in France. Thus he set an agenda of reform beginning by carefully codified police procedures and regulations, improving the professional quality of the police force with the introduction of examinations and promotions and by introducing forensic science into the work of the detective. It was during his time as prefect of police that fingerprinting became established as a method of identification. The examinations for police that he instituted were very thorough: the tests for example included determining methods of forgery and examining lock components involved in a burglary so as to tell if a lock had been picked. As befits his training as a lawyer, his was the first prefecture to introduce criminology into policing and to examine the psychology of criminals.|$|E
500|$|The King's Speech {{from the}} Throne on 21 February made {{reference}} <b>to</b> <b>introducing</b> <b>measures</b> restricting the Lords' power of veto {{to one of}} delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase [...] "in the opinion of my advisers" [...] so the King could {{be seen to be}} distancing himself from the planned legislation.|$|R
40|$|The most {{frequently}} cited direct instruments to improve customer retention- such as Value-added services, complaint management and customer clubs or cards- often neglect the importence of pricing options. In This Paper describes various pricing instruments which can be employed to increase customer retention. These include quantity-related pricing, time-based and loyalty-related pricing, group pricing, multi personel pricing, contracts and guarentees. The tools and recommendations for their use are illustrated with practical examples. The implementation of the described instruments requires appropriate systems to gather and process information and monitor the effectiveness of <b>to</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>measures.</b> These aspects are discussed at the end...|$|R

It asked member states <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> control <b>measures</b> and criminal penalties as provided under their national legislation covering psychotropic substances.|$|R
500|$|Concerns {{about crime}} and {{security}} was also linked to immigration, {{as the party}} particularly blamed Turks and Moroccans for various criminal activity, and sought a zero tolerance approach regarding law and order. The party was also strongly anti-Islamic from early on, and in its 1993 program regarded Islam as [...] "a doctrine, which preaches holy war, assassination, forced conversions, oppression of women, slavery and extermination of [...] "infidels", [...] will automatically lead to {{what we now call}} fundamentalism." [...] The party was anti-Muslim and portrayed Muslims as fifth column of a cruel and expansionist religion, and after the 1990 Gulf War called on the government <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> to keep Belgium from being Islamised.|$|E
500|$|The 1981 Act {{allowed the}} Home Secretary <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> {{in the event}} of a public {{interest}} issue. A parliamentary debate was not required, though Hurd acquiesced to one, and the issue was discussed in the House of Commons on 2 November 1988. The opposition Labour Party introduced an amendment condemning the government's decision as [...] "incompatible with a free society", but it was rejected, despite some Conservative MPs voting with Labour. The legislation was condemned by the National Council for Civil Liberties. The National Union of Journalists planned a one-day strike in protest at the ban for 10 November, but the action was called off after its members failed to reach consensus. A group of broadcast journalists subsequently launched a legal challenge to overturn the ban, but in May 1989 the High Court decided the Home Secretary had acted lawfully. A later hearing at the Appeal Court upheld that decision in December 1989.|$|E
500|$|... "My {{government}} {{was returned to}} power on a clear issue and with a definite mission... <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> {{for the preservation of}} industrial peace", Bruce declared during his second term, and called a referendum to amend the Australian Constitution and bring industrial relations under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Attempts to amend the constitution for this purpose had been rejected narrowly in 1911, 1913 and 1919, but against a background of ongoing industrial strife, Bruce made clear the problems of mixed jurisdiction, confusing dual-awards, and insufficient regulatory and enforcement powers at the Commonwealth level. Controversially, he also formulated an [...] "essential services" [...] question to be put at the same time, giving the government the power to protect the public from any [...] "actual or probable disruption to essential services". These proposals drew hostile reception from many quarters even from future conservative prime minister Robert Menzies and both the Australian Labor Party and conservative groups were divided in opinion on the amendments, with the ALP eventually taking no fixed position on the questions. But by September the issue had drawn so much controversy and ill-feeling that it was no surprise for many commentators that the proposals failed to attract sufficient popular support to overcome the high bar for constitutional change.|$|E

500|$|Partly in {{response}} to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> that would produce [...] "total war", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, {{even if they had}} child care available. After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war. His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway. The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well. During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the [...] "extermination" [...] of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, the Pope sent a Pastoral Letter to the Catholic Church in Ireland {{addressing}} {{cases of}} sexual abuse by Catholic priests to minors, expressing sorrow, and promising {{changes in the way}} accusations of abuse are dealt with. Victim groups claim the letter failed to clarify if secular law enforcement has priority over canon law confidentiality pertaining to internal investigation of abuse allegations. The Pope then promised <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> that would 'safeguard young people in the future' and 'bring to justice' priests who were responsible for abuse. In April, the Vatican issued guidelines on how existing Church law should be implemented. The guideline dictates that [...] "Civil law concerning reporting of crimes... should always be followed." [...] The guideline was intended to follow the norms established by U.S. bishops, but it does not require the reporting of [...] "allegations" [...] or crimes where reporting is not required by law.|$|E

2500|$|As of late 2015, {{development}} of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations. Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the European Community and China. Low-cost production by OPEC continued at maximum capacity, efficiency of production from U.S. shales continued to improve, and Russian exports were mandated even below cost of production, as their only source of hard currency. There is also {{the possibility that there}} will emerge an international agreement <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>measures</b> to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2°C that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels. Rapid technological progress is being made to reduce the cost of competing renewable sources of energy. [...] Hence there is no consensus about when, if ever, oil prices paid to producers may substantially recover.|$|E
