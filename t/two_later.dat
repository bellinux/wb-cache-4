They were treated at the park's first aid station, and <b>two</b> <b>later</b> sought further medical attention.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} seemingly cannibalistic murders in New Jersey. The <b>two</b> <b>later</b> come across {{what seems to be}} an evolutionary relict which may have inspired tales of the Jersey Devil.|$|E
5|$|Aerith Gainsborough {{is first}} {{introduced}} as a flower seller, when she briefly converses with Cloud Strife, a mercenary {{working for the}} anti-government group AVALANCHE, who are fleeing from the bombing of a Mako reactor. The <b>two</b> <b>later</b> meet in Aerith's church in the Sector 5 slums, where she is faced {{with the possibility of}} capture by the Turks.

This caused Devine to panic and hit Young in the head with the chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning his shoulders to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that <b>two</b> <b>later</b> died. The survivor was awarded a pension, {{believed to be the first}} in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|Azaria {{began dating}} former actress Katie Wright in 2007, and the <b>two</b> <b>later</b> married. They {{have a son}} together, Hal, {{who was born in}} 2009. In 2013, the family moved to New York, renting a home on 80th Street, with plans to make a final {{decision}} on where to live in two years. They previously lived in a four-bedroom house in Pacific Palisades, which Azaria bought from his The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta in 2011. Several weeks earlier, Azaria sold his home in Bel Air. Azaria previously owned the fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, which he bought in 2005 from photographer Cindy Sherman, before selling it in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{broadcasting}} for {{the season}} began, Duchovny sued Fox and eventually announced his decision to leave the show. As a result, the season {{would be the last}} to feature Duchovny in a full-time capacity until Season 10, although he would return in seasons 8 and 9 as an intermittent main character. Due to this eventual character change, this season would be the last to feature the original opening sequence for the series, as the <b>two</b> <b>later</b> years updated the intro in an attempt to renew and revive the series.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted <b>two</b> <b>later</b> gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the raid}} one {{civilian}} and three American soldiers had been killed and eight wounded including the Ojo de Agua post's commanding officer, Sergeant Schaffer, who was included among the former. The Seditionistas also took several casualties, with five men dead and at least nine others wounded, of whom <b>two</b> <b>later</b> died. A Japanese man was found among the dead, as were two Carranzista soldiers, a fact which was seen as evidence that the Carranzistas had been supporting the Plan of San Diego. The American soldiers were commended for their bravery during the raid, and Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the engagement.|$|E

5|$|During the Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock! tour, Paul and Joe DeGeorge {{received}} a letter from Warner Brothers that stated that the brothers were breaking copyright laws. Although Paul sent a letter to Warner Brothers in an attempt to smooth things over, Marc Brandon, the company representative, asked to speak to Paul personally. The <b>two</b> <b>later</b> settled upon a Gentlemen's agreement that, in essence, would allow Harry and the Potters to continue to sell music online and tour, but all other merchandise could only be sold at live shows.|$|E
5|$|His reign was troubled, being {{marked by}} {{conflicts}} {{with some of}} his brothers, antagonism with the various branches of the Buyids for influence in Baghdad, and attacks by the Byzantine Empire under John I Tzimiskes. His relations with the Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, were initially hostile, but the <b>two</b> <b>later</b> concluded an alliance. In 978, the Jazira was occupied by the Buyids of Shiraz under 'Adud al-Dawla, and he fled to the Fatimid-controlled parts of Syria, where he tried to secure the governorship of Damascus, and became involved in local rivalries which resulted in his defeat in battle and execution on 29 August 979.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in <b>two</b> <b>later</b> paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E

5|$|In the 970s, Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade, {{became the}} most {{powerful}} man in Norway, at first supported by Harald Bluetooth of Denmark and paying tribute to him—though the <b>two</b> <b>later</b> fell out over religious matters. Harald had converted to Christianity and was eager to Christianise Norway, while Haakon remained a staunch pagan. In 995 Haakon was deposed and the young Christian leader Olaf Tryggvason came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, Hidjo {{stays with}} a local family and enjoys {{the beauty of the}} Netherlands. The family's daughter, Betje, finds him {{intriguing}} because of his ethnicity. Although Hidjo initially receives her coldly, the <b>two</b> <b>later</b> become romantically and sexually involved. In Surakarta, Walter becomes attracted to Biroe and breaks off his engagement with Roos, who in turn aborts their child. This, and Biroe's rejection, leads him to return to the Netherlands, where he and Hidjo meet.|$|E
