25|$|To employ this formula, {{one has to}} {{identify}} a critical controlled source for the particular amplifier circuit in hand. For example, P could be the control parameter {{of one of the}} controlled sources in a <b>two-port</b> <b>network,</b> as shown for a particular case in D'Amico et al. As a different example, if we take a12 = a12 = 1, P = A, a22 = – (negative feedback) and a11 = 0 (no feedforward), we regain the simple result with two unidirectional blocks.|$|E
25|$|For example, for a current-{{feedback}} amplifier, current {{from the}} output is sampled for feedback and combined with current at the input. Therefore, the feedback ideally {{is performed using}} an (output) current-controlled current source (CCCS), and its imperfect realization using a <b>two-port</b> <b>network</b> also must incorporate a CCCS, that is, the appropriate choice for feedback network is a g-parameter two-port. Here the two-port method used in most textbooks is presented, using the circuit treated in the article on asymptotic gain model.|$|E
25|$|Negative-feedback {{amplifiers}} of {{any type}} can be implemented using combinations of two-port networks. There are four types of <b>two-port</b> <b>network,</b> {{and the type of}} amplifier desired dictates the choice of two-ports and the selection of one of the four different connection topologies shown in the diagram. These connections are usually referred to as series or shunt (parallel) connections. In the diagram, the left column shows shunt inputs; the right column shows series inputs. The top row shows series outputs; the bottom row shows shunt outputs. The various combinations of connections and two-ports are listed in the table below.|$|E
50|$|To {{check if}} two <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> can be {{connected}} in a parallel-parallel configuration, {{first of all}} just the input ports are connected in parallel, a voltage {{is applied to the}} input and the open-circuit voltage is measured/calculated between the outputs that are short-circuited each. If there is a voltage drop, the <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> cannot be combined in parallel. The same test is repeated from the output side of the <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> (parallel connection of the output ports, application of a voltage to the output, measurement/calculation of the open-circuit voltage between the inputs that are short-circuited each). Only if there is no voltage drop in both cases, a combination of the <b>two-ports</b> <b>networks</b> is permissible.|$|R

This could be applied to problems that were entirely in the mechanical domain, but for mechanical filters with an electrical application it is necessary to include the transducer in the analogy as well.
