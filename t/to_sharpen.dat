5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Vijithapura fortress is uncertain. A village with the same name near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir {{may have been the}} place where the battle took place. There is an ancient temple here as well as a granite stone that locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers <b>to</b> <b>sharpen</b> their swords However, other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to Kaduruwela near Polonnaruwa, where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found.|$|E
5|$|At George Washington University, a {{group of}} artists sketch a nude male model. However, one of the artists, John Mostow (Levani Outchaneichvili), draws a demonic {{creature}} in the model's place; while using a utility knife <b>to</b> <b>sharpen</b> his pencil he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing. When the model reaches his car after the session, he is attacked and killed by an obscured assailant. The following morning, Mostow is arrested in his apartment by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson (Kurtwood Smith), who finds the utility knife used in the murder covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried <b>to</b> <b>sharpen</b> a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew {{as soon as he saw}} Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E

5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was <b>to</b> <b>sharpen</b> the transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students <b>to</b> <b>sharpen</b> their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E

25|$|There is {{support for}} several methods of {{sharpening}} and blurring images, including the blur and sharpen tool.

The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>sharpening</b> blurred pictures using the moment-preserving principle is proposed.

The sharpening operation can also be applied iteratively to an input picture <b>to</b> get better <b>sharpening</b> effect.
