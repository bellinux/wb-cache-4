The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila-Irizarry and musician Charlie Clouser. The sequence {{is set in the}} Harmons' basement and includes images of postmortem young children, unborn (or aborted) babies in jars, skulls, a Christening dress, a nurse's uniform, and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers.

500|$|The {{screenplay}} did not {{yet have}} a satisfactory ending, and, despite the producers and studio executives worried about starting filming without a set conclusion, Liman opted to finish the script during principal photography. McQuarrie at one point suggested adding a twist involving the Mimics figuring out Cage's attack on Paris and resetting time during his strike, but discarded it as [...] "you were so exhausted by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> got to that point." [...] Eventually, McQuarrie considered that focusing on the comedic aspects meant [...] "it needed to end in a way that wasn't harsh", and thus opted to end the plot where it started, on the helicopter bringing Cage to London, fulfilling the notion that [...] "comedies generally {{have to go back to}} the way things were".|$|E
500|$|PedroII {{regarded}} {{the death of}} his son as [...] "the most fatal blow that I could ever receive, and certainly I would not have survived were it not that I still have a wife and two children". The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The {{relative}} importance of the two men's contributions has been debated by critics. David Thomson wrote about [...] "the problem in assessing [...] career: who did what in their collaboration? And what is Donen's real standing as a director?" [...] Thomson remarked that [...] "nothing in his career suggests that Gene Kelly could have filmed himself singing in the rain with the exhilaration of Donen's retreating crane shot." [...] However set reports state that Kelly rode the camera boom between shots and during camera set-ups. Donen stated that [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> hash it through {{from beginning to end}} ten million times, you can't remember who did what except in a few instances where you remember getting an idea." [...] Composer Saul Chaplin said that [...] "Gene was the prime mover and Stanley an eager and talented pupil." [...] During the shooting of On the Town, all memos and correspondence from MGM to the production were addressed exclusively to Donen and not to Kelly.|$|E

500|$|Sinden {{considered}} {{the first period}} of the first Swedish game the team's worst since the team was put together, but the team improved and started to take command. Henderson, Clarke, Cashman and Parise scored. Sinden criticized the German referees: [...] "...they were absolutely terrible. They couldn't even skate. They were miles behind the play all night and don't know the damn rules. Their incompetence helped the game become very bitter." [...] The players were also introduced to the style of play of the Swedes, who were well used to using stick work to throw off their opponents. [...] "They were spearing, holding, interfering, and most of all, backstabbing." [...] The Canadian players would retaliate and be penalized for their retribution. As {{an example of the}} referees' incompetence, Sinden pointed out that Esposito had been penalized for cross-checking, and given a misconduct for it. Sinden, who had played international ice hockey, knew that under international rules at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> could not give a misconduct for cross-checking.|$|E
500|$|Fey {{is known}} for her deadpan humor and delivery; her [...] "sardonic wit" [...] has become a {{trademark}} of hers, upon which several critics have commented in their reviews of Fey's work. According to Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara, Fey [...] "project both oblivious security and hyper-alert insecurity with the same expression" [...] in her performances, while The Chronicles Dillon Fernando wrote that the actress specializes in [...] "delectable, situational and ironic comedy". On Fey's comedic prowess, Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels enthused that his former employee [...] "has a very clear take on things ... It always comes from a place of intelligence and there is just an edge to it." [...] Michaels concluded, [...] "It's not fearful. It's strong and confident and you recognise the voice and most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> agree with it." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Christopher Goodwin believes that Fey [...] "fashioned her comic persona around her glasses", which she has worn since 1995; Fey joked that [...] "Glasses make anyone look smarter".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} {{a message of}} female strength, the song lyrics were described as [...] "goofy" [...] and [...] "fun" [...] by Larry Katz from the Boston Herald. Reading [...] "Just like the Calgon commercial / I really gotta get up out of here", Carey tells her lover that she is leaving him, making a [...] "clever" [...] reference to a commercial. In regards to the latter lyrics, Lawrence Farber from the Windy City Times wrote [...] "they are a playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple." [...] She then sings [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> get this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] establishing that the relationship is over, and that he shouldn't even try to mend the situation.

500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{welcomed the}} ability to dual-wield weapons and magic. An editor for PC PowerPlay felt that the dual-wielding ability [...] "transforms the {{tactical}} scope of each combat encounter". Shibley noted that the dual-wielding option gave the player more freedom to experiment with combat, writing that, [...] "{{the ability to}} apply a spell to each hand... generates huge potential for getting creative with your spell combinations". However, many reviewers were critical of the melee combat, feeling {{that it had not}} been improved upon as much as other areas in the game. Justin McElroy of Joystiq felt that, [...] "what should be thrilling fights in Skyrim are often weighed down by the same clunky melee system Oblivion suffered from". Onyett described the melee combat as [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "floaty", and that [...] "many times it feels like you're slicing air instead of a mythical creature's flesh". Francis agreed with this sentiment, stating that, [...] "too much of <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits".|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston for The Guardian said he {{was missing}} the interplay between Rodney and Del Boy from the original, {{and that the only}} fun in the drama was [...] "recognising the nods, working out who's who and how it all fits into place. Otherwise, it's pretty lame." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline [...] "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's {{performance}} as Freddie [...] "laughable" [...] and saying it was [...] "bizarre" [...] that the storyline [...] "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him". In The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe said that [...] "the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite a lot of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> were well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you". Benji Wilson from The Daily Telegraph also wasn't impressed saying the viewer would have been disappointed if they [...] "tuned in wanting to be entertained, enthused, or anything in between", and that it was an [...] "ocean-going stinker".|$|E

500|$|Sahar Ghosh from Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{felt that}} the best songs on the EP were [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer", saying that [...] "the lyrics Madonna sang in 2001 [...] still (unfortunately) ring true today, but they acquire a new poignancy as they are sung by the boys in Glee Club. [...] But the best {{performance}} of the album is definitely 'Like a Prayer'. The talented voices of the Glee cast, backed by a full choir, masterfully carry the lyrics to greater heights." [...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A" [...] rating, explaining [...] "Sue hilariously revises the spoken-word bit on 'Vogue', and the Glee guys give a surprisingly tender reading of 'What It Feels Like for a Girl'. Go ahead— open your heart." [...] David Hiltbrand from Star Tribune gave a negative review of the EP saying that [...] "things go downhill as soon as Jane Lynch starts camping up the spoken portion of 'Vogue'. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> get to 'Like a Virgin' and '4 Minutes', the songs sound overproduced and melodramatic, more show tune than disco." ...|$|E

It is presented in one continuous shot, with no edits. The video begins with a TV screen and the word 'Mimi' appearing, while on the monitor, Dupri raps his introduction. As the television fades, Carey is then shown lying in a bathtub overflowing with water and rose petals, with her hair flowing {{over the side of}} the tub. Next, the camera follows down one floor of the mansion to find Carey, decked out in bright blue makeup and high heels, as she sings [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> get this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] into the phone.
