5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> fish moving upstream. These large runs {{continued into the}} 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{captured}} the Malayan Peninsula, both ships moved to Singapore harbour. On 8 February, the Japanese launched an amphibious assault across the Strait of Johore and following heavy fighting, many ships began evacuating from the harbour. By 11 February Gnat and Grasshopper were the largest vessels left. The two ships left Singapore for Batavia at 21:00 on 13 February, having taken on other personnel to evacuate them. Amongst these was Commander Ian Forbes, {{formerly of the}} battleship , which had been sunk by the Japanese just over two months earlier. By the following morning <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> attacks by Japanese aircraft on other vessels in the distance. As they were sailing south, they were attacked by Japanese bombers. During the initial pass, Grasshopper {{was hit by a}} single bomb. When the planes returned, Dragonfly was hit three times and sank quickly. Grasshopper was hit twice and was set on fire. The order to abandon ship was given as the fire spread to compartments adjacent to an ammunition store.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the United States District Court for the District of Idaho, however, {{found that}} Congress {{did not have}} the {{authority}} to extend the deadline, even when only contained within the proposing joint resolution's resolving clause. The Supreme Court had decided to take up the case, bypassing the Court of Appeals, but before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case, the extended period granted by Congress had been exhausted without the necessary number of states, thus rendering the case moot.|$|E

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|On 23 July, the {{day after}} leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: [...] "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!" [...] In the {{succeeding}} days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although {{by the end of}} July <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.|$|E
2500|$|Haig {{immediately}} requested Capt. Dave Ernest {{lay down}} artillery cover fire. Five {{minutes after the}} Viet Cong registration round landed, {{the first of several}} hundred rounds of 60-mm., 82-mm., and 120-mm. mortar fire were directed into the northern portions of the American perimeter. The Americans estimated the source of fire to be [...] northeast of the defensive perimeter. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> rounds being fired and concluded that the Viet Cong were nearby, and that so many mortars were firing that they [...] "sounded like loud, heavy machine guns." [...] Due to the early warning and thus the rapid response, only 12 men were wounded.|$|E

2500|$|The 1994 tour (for {{which the}} band {{included}} side man Billy Sherwood on additional guitar and keyboards) used a sound system developed by Rabin named Concertsonics which allowed the audience located in certain seating areas to tune portable FM radios {{to a specific}} frequency, so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> concert with headphones. In early 1995, following the tour, Rabin, feeling that he had achieved his highest ambitions with Talk, lamented its disappointing reception as being [...] "just wasn’t what people wanted to hear at the time" [...] and noted {{at the conclusion of}} the tour that [...] "I think I’m done" [...] and returned to LA where he shifted his focus to composing for films. Kaye also left Yes to pursue other projects.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s a Bengali mosque {{named the}} Al-Islah Jamee Masjid wanted {{permission}} to broadcast the adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, from loudspeakers {{outside of the}} mosque and requested this permission from the city government. It {{was one of the}} newer mosques in Hamtramck. Sally Howell, author of [...] "Competing for Muslims: New Strategies for Urban Renewal in Detroit", wrote that the request [...] "brought to a head simmering Islamophobic sentiments" [...] in Hamtramck. Muslims and interfaith activists supported the mosque. Some anti-Muslim activists, including some from other states including Kentucky and Ohio, participated in the controversy. Howell added that the controversy, through an [...] "international media storm", gave [...] "a cathartic test of the [...] "freedoms" [...] we were said to be [...] "fighting for" [...] in Afghanistan and Iraq" [...] to the remainder of the United States. In 2004 the city council voted unanimously to allow mosques to broadcast the adhan on public streets, {{making it one of the}} few U.S. cities to allow this to occur. Some individuals had strongly objected to the allowing of the adhan, some continue to object. In 2015, some residents complained that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> electronically amplified call to prayer inside their homes five times a day, with one of those daily times being at 6 A.M.|$|E
2500|$|At about 11:15am, Bravo {{entered a}} house in the town to take cover. The Iraqi family who lived in the house were told to lie on the floor; not because they were hostages, but for their own safety in case anyone outside had seen Bravo {{entering}} and tried to shoot into the house. Alpha were pinned down by effective fire [...] from the police station on the northern side of town. The Officer in Charge (OIC) of Alpha, Lieutenant Ross Kennedy, was being targeted by a sniper, and so {{the decision was made to}} hold until the QRF (Quick Reaction Force) arrived from Abu Naji to help. Bravo deployed mini-flares on the roof of the house that they were occupying to alert the Chinook to their presence. Unfortunately, because of damage and casualties, the Chinook had to return to Abu Naji. The setting off of the mini-flares did alert the Iraqi gunmen to Bravo's position, who now found themselves having to shoot out of the house at the armed Iraqis clambering over the walls to get to them. At 11:30am, Bravo split into two sections so that one section stayed behind and provided covering fire for the other section. They manouevred and fired in turn until both sections met up again to form just one. Bravo managed to get clear just as the mob had encircled the house they were in. Bravo maintained a northwards direction along an irrigation ditch, which slowed them down because of the mud that was sticking to their boots. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> engines of the Scimitars and the Land Rovers of the QRF. Sgt Robertson launched mini-flares to alert the QRF to his position, but he was unable to know if the QRF had seen them. Therefore, Private Freddy Ellis was tasked to cover [...] of dead ground between them and the QRF wagons. Ellis stripped off his webbing and ran, zigzagging all the way to the QRF column to relate the position of Bravo Company.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} origins from Diana Deutschs {{work with the}} octave {{illusion}} and investigates if musically trained subjects can give a more correct perception of the octave illusion if their visual senses also get stimulated in form of scores. Ten subjects, with over 20 years experience playing an instrument, participated in the investigation. The result shows that a more correct perception of the octave illusion depends on the educational level in scorereading. Four out of five subjects who valued their knowledge in scorereading as being good or very good reported that the score corresponded to what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>the</b> right ear, which {{is connected to the}} dominant hemisphere. When they were instructed to focus on both ears three of these subjects reported that the score corresponded to what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>the</b> left ear, but that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> lower tone in the right ear. As the scores for the right ear were equal for the identical soundexamples this perception could be an indication that stimuli are percieved as being complex and the interpretation is alternated to the non dominant hemisphere...|$|R
