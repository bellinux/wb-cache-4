5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is {{tasked with}} winning the Scranton White Pages account. However, the CEO is a woman, and Dwight has trouble selling to women. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{and the women}} of the office teach him how to {{interact}} with women. The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the White Pages, only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, so he has Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic comment to Jan's assistant (a woman). Pam is pleased, seeing that some of the lessons they gave Dwight on women sunk in after all.|$|E

However in an interview, Gomez stated, during an interview that the song ultimately is a ridicule of the Hollywood life and fame, that was the meaning behind [...] "Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya." [...] Gomez further elaborated on the concept of the song on an interview with Just Jared Jr., saying, It's basically about Hollywood and what people <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> essentially how plastic it is sometimes. It's fun and I think girls can relate to it somewhat, for me it was because of Hollywood but it can really relate to a mean girl, an ex-boyfriend, to whoever.|$|E
500|$|The {{joke about}} Mulder wanting Richard Gere {{to appear in}} the movie stemmed from the fact that Duchovny's acting was often {{compared}} to Gere's. Duchovny decided to turn the idea into a joke, saying, [...] "we used to always have the joke on set that when they do the movie it's going to be Richard Gere and Jodie Foster [...] So I originally wrote the teaser for Richard Gere and Jodie Foster and I just started to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> you know, it's so much funnier with Garry and Téa." [...] The episode featured several uncredited celebrity cameos. During the premiere of the movie, Duchovny's Return to Me costars Minnie Driver and David Alan Grier appear as members of the audience. In addition, Chris Carter, the show's creator, made a cameo during the theater scene. The appearance was his second in the series.|$|E
500|$|At this point, Team International's Sabin and Shelley took {{advantage}} of their well-developed teamwork, having worked together as the Motor City Machine Guns since 2006, by double-teaming Dr. Wagner Jr. to allow Shelley to eliminate the Doctor over 47 minutes into the match. Just over a minute later Shocker and Último Guerrero countered one of Corleone's high flying moves to pin and eliminate Corleone from Team International. A double Superkick to Shocker allowed Shelley and Sabin to eliminate him, leaving Último Guerrero as {{the only member of}} Team Mexico. Último Guerrero was able to pin Chris Sabin, leaving only himself and Shelley. In the closing moments of the match, Último Guerrero managed to pin Sabin, eliminating him from the match. Minutes later Alex Shelley locked in a submission hold, then pulled Guerrero's mask off in the process out of view of the referee. The hold and Guerrero's attempts to cover his face led to Último Guerrero submitting to the hold moments later, giving Alex Shelley the victory and the International Gran Prix trophy. After the match Último Guerrero challenged Alex Shelley to a Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", where Shelly would risk his hair against Guerrero's wrestling mask.

500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; {{a lot of it is}} just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen."

In contrast, Wittgenstein's book treats philosophy as an activity, rather {{along the lines of}} Socrates's famous method of maieutics; he has the reader work through various problems, participating actively in the investigation. [...] Rather than presenting a philosophical problem and its solution, Wittgenstein engages in a dialogue, where he provides a thought experiment (a hypothetical example or situation), describes how one might be inclined to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> then shows why that inclination suffers from conceptual confusion.

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
