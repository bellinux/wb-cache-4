5|$|As the {{political}} power in Norway was consolidated and had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with external threats, larger structures were built in accordance with military technology at the time. Fortresses, bridges, and ultimately churches and manors were built with stone and masonry. These structures followed the European styles of their time.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Somali Civil War {{drew the}} world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide {{humanitarian}} assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched {{the first of}} 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia {{as part of the}} Unified Task Force (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief. Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J. Perry, had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück. The unit {{not only had}} <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the enemy, but also with working through the 'teething' phase of the Me 262and developing the tactics appropriate for a jet unit. On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Severing {{professional}} {{ties with}} father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed {{the music of}} her previous releases {{in favor of an}} intimate, personal album. 4s lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs to Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which appeared on the standard edition.|$|E
5|$|The French {{army was}} forced to march through rain and black {{coal-dust}} mud to reach Waterloo, and then <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with mud and rain as it slept in the open.

5|$|The Ottomans faced {{numerous}} opponents between 1424 and 1453. Tied down by {{the siege}} of Thessalonika, the Ottomans had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the Serbs under George Brankovic, the Hungarians under John Hunyadi and the Albanians under George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. This resistance culminated into the Crusade of Varna of 1444, which, despite much local support and deception - a peace treaty was unilaterally revoked by the Hungarians - was defeated.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E
5|$|As CAS, Williams had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> {{with serious}} {{challenges}} to the RAAF's continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was {{the independence of the}} Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos would have <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> {{with thousands of}} meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; {{there is no evidence}} in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Wojtek Wolski was the Avalanche player seen as {{favorite}} <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> for the Calder Memorial Trophy; however, the scoring streak put Stastny into contention as well. Stastny's play {{was one of the reasons}} the Avalanche experienced their best run of the season towards the end, winning 15 of their last 19games but missing the playoffs by one point. Stastny ended his rookie season with 78points, finished second to Pittsburgh Penguins' Evgeni Malkin in the voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy and was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.|$|E
5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E

However, the department had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E
5|$|In {{earliest}} recorded history, Norway {{was divided}} {{into a number of}} small and sometimes warring petty kingdoms with weak central authority. In traditional historiography the rise of Harald Fairhair in the 9th century started the process of unification of the country and the consolidation of royal power. Harald's descendants, and other claimants to the throne, had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with strong regional leaders such as the Jarls of Lade in the north and the rulers of Vingulmark in the east, while the kings of Denmark claimed regions in the south and were eager to acquire Norwegian vassals to increase their influence. The spread of Christianity also became an increasingly important political issue in the late 10th century.|$|E
5000|$|The Buckeyes {{would win}} nine games {{in each of}} the next six years and won 10 games in 1986. They also won or shared three more Big Ten titles (outright in 1984, shared in 1981 and 1986). However, they would only appear in one more Rose Bowl (after the 1984 season) and would only tally one more top ten finish (in 1986). This rankled a fan base used <b>to</b> <b>contending</b> for a {{national}} title every year.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>contending</b> that NASA {{never sent}} astronauts to the Moon, René also proposes {{a number of}} other ideas that fly in the face of conventional knowledge. René outlined most of these beliefs in his self-published book, The Last Skeptic of Science (1995). The original title of the book, MENSA Lectures (1990), resulted in a lawsuit against him by Mensa who felt he was misappropriating the name of their organization and using it to suggest they backed his beliefs.|$|R
50|$|Richard Henry O'Connell (September 19, 1914 - August 18, 2002) was an American {{front office}} {{executive}} in Major League Baseball. He was {{executive vice president}} of the Boston Red Sox from 1961 through 1977 and served as general manager of the team from September 16, 1965, through October 24, 1977, a period during which he played a pivotal role in restoring the Red Sox <b>to</b> <b>contending</b> status, won two American League pennants, and helped make the team a flagship MLB franchise.|$|R
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
5|$|Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> {{with a team}} {{thought to}} be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which {{consisted}} of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the AWA. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in Jack Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to {{only be a}} one-year project, Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec {{over the course of}} 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine. The first shows were riddled with difficulty, starting {{with the collapse of the}} big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap. Working with a borrowed tent, Laliberté then had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with difficulties with the European performers. They were so unhappy with the Quebec circus's inexperience that they had, at one point, sent a letter to the media complaining about how they were being treated.|$|E

30|$|Another {{congestion}} avoidance protocol, named C 3 TCP [10], is also founded on link capacity measurements and adjustment of the outgoing data rate {{according to these}} measurements, at each sender node side. This solution requires the introduction of an additional module within the IEEE 802.11 protocol stack in order {{to carry out the}} capacity measurements. The same principle was used by Rangwala et al. in [11] to establish a congestion control scheme for static wireless mesh networks: a distributed rate controller estimates the available capacity within each neighborhood and divides it <b>to</b> <b>contending</b> flows.|$|R
60|$|In {{the time}} of the decline and death of Dickens, and even more {{strongly}} after it, there arose a school of criticism which substantially maintained that a man wrote better when he was ill. It was some such sentiment as this that made Mr. George Gissing, that able writer, come near <b>to</b> <b>contending</b> that Little Dorrit is Dickens's best book. It was the principle of his philosophy to maintain (I know not why) that a man was more likely to perceive the truth when in low spirits than when in high spirits.|$|R
