[...] Wrexham midfielder Davies accused Arsenal of underestimating their opponents and felt their unrest at having conceded the equaliser worked to the home side's advantage: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be a lot more}} professional when they were leading and tighten it up.

When asked if they were surprised at being initially paired up Dawson said, [...] "Yes, i was. The scene in which they got together was absolutely hilarious. Darren just looked up and there she was!" [...] before Fox added [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> last, but we just went for it full throttle". Fox later explained that the pairing [...] "was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing".|$|E

500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia.

500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 6, and Obama was projected the winner at about 11:14 pm Eastern Standard Time. [...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine battleground states, and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign. I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his career}} as player and journalist, Fingleton {{persistently}} came into personal conflict with Don Bradman, one of the captains under whom Fingleton played, damaging the reputations of both. Bradman characteristically held his silence during Fingleton's lifetime. Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, he gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with those of Irish descent such as Fingleton being Catholic and Anglo-Australians such as Bradman being predominantly Protestant, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. During the 1936–37 Ashes series in Australia, four Catholics, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, leading batsman and vice-captain Stan McCabe along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. When Bradman was dismissed in his final Test innings in 1948 for a duck, Fingleton and O'Reilly were reported to be laughing hysterically in the pressbox. E W Swanton said that [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have stroke". Bradman later wrote after both had died: [...] "With these fellows out of the way, the loyalty of my 1948 side was a big joy and made a big contribution to the outstanding success of that tour".|$|E

50|$|The {{group of}} Green 2000 {{supporters}} {{that ran the}} party in 1991-2 presided over an unsuccessful General election campaign, which was ill-prepared, {{and led to a}} subsequent demoralization and large drop in membership. The party was also unable to cope with the growth in members it had experienced some years before. The strategy was open to criticism for raising hopes unrealistically and not then delivering the necessary changes needed to drive the party forward. However, the Green 2000 group itself felt that the 'decentralists' managed to sap their energies and prevent direction being formed.It also strengthened those in the party who shared Green 2000's electoral bias but <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> about in the wrong way.|$|R

Each team was told to head east, pass through the swamp, and arrive in the meadow. Neither team was told that a lake lay in their path. The shortest course for each team would be to pass between the lakes. Team One navigated east correctly, but then took the long way (north) around the lake. Their five-hour hike turned into a 10-hour trek. Team One arrived at the meadow, however. Team Two's navigation was errant, and the team traveled east for {{only a short time}} before drifting east-southeast. When Team Two reached the lake, they became lost and turned north when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> south. Team Two then mistakenly doubled back to its starting point and never made it to the meadow.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{repositories}} {{have been}} with us {{for more than a}} decade, and despite the considerable media and conference attention they engender, we know very little about their use by academics. This paper sets out to address this by reporting on how well <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used, what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used for, what researchers' think of them, and where <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> Nearly 1, 700 scientific researchers, mostly physical scientists, responded to an international survey of digital repositories, making it the largest survey of its kind. High deposit rates were found and mandates appear to be working, especially with younger researchers. Repositories have made significant inroads in terms of impact and use despite, in the case of institutional repositories, the very limited resources deployed. Subject repositories, like arXiv and PubMed Central, have certainly come of age but institutional repositories probably have not come of age yet although there are drivers in place which, in theory anyway, are moving them towards early adulthood. 12025...|$|R

[...] As a show of good faith the Comanche chiefs brought in two captives, a Mexican boy and an adolescent girl named Matilda Lockhart. The Texans <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> against their word, because the Comanche chiefs did not return all of the white captives and figured they held back some of their white captives to guarantee their own safety.

50|$|Consequently, the MCM was {{designed}} {{to fill the gap}} for previously unknown and/or inaccessible products from the perspective of both entrepreneurs and the villagers — their potential customers. MCM entrepreneurs engage in businesses where supplies have never existed, perceived demand is highly unpredictable, and thus the environment is uncertain. Beneficiaries often barely understand the needs MCM products and services address. For example, MCM entrepreneurs have helped thousands of village weavers who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> blind to solve their problems instantly by getting a free eye exam and buying a $5 pair of reading glasses. The weavers would never have thought of this solution because they did not even understand their problem. The MCM entrepreneurs in turn had never <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would <b>be</b> able to offer such a service, which was previously only accessible for los ricos, the rich. This is a highly uncertain situation for an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs must be empowered through a mechanism that finances the support and time necessary to change perceived uncertainty into risk that can be evaluated.|$|R
