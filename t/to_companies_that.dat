25|$|In most poorer countries, health care—ranging {{from basic}} {{pharmaceuticals}} and postnatal care to costly multidrug therapies—remains very limited. Market forces drive private pharmaceutical companies, and many developed country government research programs, {{to focus on}} drugs needed in their environment, not necessarily those of the poorer countries. This is generating a growing controversy between rich and poorer nations over such issues as intellectual property rights, as some developing countries make their own copies, not always with permission, of drugs under patent protection. Developing countries also are less willing to make microbial samples available <b>to</b> <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> will make commercial vaccines from them, which may be too costly for the country that provided the sample.|$|E

Carefully orchestrating the lobby before both houses of Congress, Buenaventura led the efforts for the passage of the law, telling lawmakers that the banking industry needed the flexibility since the government did not have the resources to launch its own rescue efforts.|$|E
