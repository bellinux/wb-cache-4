5|$|On 29 May 2000, Suharto {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} when Indonesian {{authorities}} began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, {{it was announced that}} he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> embezzling US$571 million of government donations to {{one of a number of}} foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110m (£55m).|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{scheduled}} as a mid-season replacement and rushed into production {{to meet the}} premiere date of April 9, 2009. As a result, when the series was featured at a panel during the January 2009 television critics press tour, NBC {{did not have a}} finished episode to screen, only a copy of the pilot script available for review. Some of the parts were still not cast and the series, which did not yet have a name, was referred to as The Untitled Amy Poehler Project or TUAPP. The name Public Service was considered, but ultimately rejected because network officials did not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> mocking the idea. In a commercial that aired during NBC's Super Bowl coverage in February, it was announced that the series would be called Parks and Recreation.|$|E

25|$|NBN Co's stated their {{usage of}} 'premises passed' was an 'accepted {{industry}} definition'. However, their corporate plan defined 'premises passed' as places where 'NBN services may be ordered and purchased', causing NBN Co <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> 'creative accounting'.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{membership}} base {{leads to}} large crowd pulling power {{which has caused}} the AFL <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> favouring Collingwood when scheduling to maximise the league's attendance figures. However the AFL states that {{this is due to}} other clubs requesting home games at the MCG against Collingwood.|$|E
25|$|The cabinet {{construed}} {{the sanctions}} against it as directed against Austria as such, {{and attempted to}} prod the nation into a national rallying (Nationaler Schulterschluss) behind the coalition parties. This provoked a temporary heating of the political climate severe enough for dissidents such as Jelinek <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> treason by coalition supporters.|$|E

25|$|Before the First World War, {{he was a}} muck-raking {{journalist}} with sympathies for the Hungarian Social Democratic Party in Kolozsvár. In addition, Kun {{served on}} the Kolozsvár Social Insurance Board, from which he was later <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> embezzling. He had a fiery reputation and was involved in duels several times. In May 1913 he married Irén Gál, a music teacher of middle-class background.|$|E
25|$|In June 1459 a Great Council {{was summoned}} to meet at Coventry. York, the Nevilles and some other lords refused to appear, fearing that the armed forces that had been {{commanded}} to assemble the previous month had been summoned to arrest them. Instead, York and Salisbury recruited in their strongholds and met Warwick, who had brought with him his troops from Calais, at Worcester. Parliament {{was summoned to}} meet at Coventry in November, but without York and the Nevilles. This could only mean that they were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> treason.|$|E
25|$|In late 1790 the French {{army was}} in {{considerable}} disarray. The military officer corps was largely composed of noblemen, who found {{it increasingly difficult}} to maintain order within the ranks. In some cases, soldiers (drawn from the lower classes) had turned against their aristocratic commanders and attacked them. At Nancy, General Bouillé successfully put down one such rebellion, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> being anti-revolutionary for doing so. This and other such incidents spurred a mass desertion as more and more officers defected to other countries, leaving a dearth of experienced leadership within the army.|$|E

25|$|The Almohad dynasty, which overthrew the dynasty {{that ran}} Spain {{during the early}} Muslim era, offered Christians and Jews the choice of {{conversion}} or expulsion; in 1165, one of their rulers ordered that all Jews in the country convert on pain of death (forcing the Jewish rabbi, theologian, philosopher, and physician Maimonides to feign conversion to Islam before fleeing the country). In Egypt, Maimonides resumed practicing Judaism openly only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> apostasy. He was saved from death by Saladin's chief administrator, who held that conversion under coercion is invalid.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was {{by any standard}} extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's discomfort with any conversation that was not strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, {{but the question of}} how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since he did not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> nepotism.|$|E
25|$|How {{dangerous}} it was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> {{being an}} atheist {{at this time}} {{is illustrated by the}} examples of Étienne Dolet, who was strangled and burned in 1546, and Giulio Cesare Vanini, who received a similar fate in 1619. In 1689 the Polish nobleman Kazimierz Łyszczyński, who had denied the existence of God in his philosophical treatise De non existentia Dei, was imprisoned unlawfully; despite Warsaw Confederation tradition and king Sobieski's intercession, Łyszczyński was condemned to death for atheism and beheaded in Warsaw after his tongue was pulled out with a burning iron and his hands slowly burned. Similarly in 1766, the French nobleman François-Jean de la Barre, was tortured, beheaded, and his body burned for alleged vandalism of a crucifix, a case that became a cause célèbre because Voltaire tried unsuccessfully to have the judgment reversed.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea was}} partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach and the encouragement of improvisation among the cast, even though the episodes were scripted. The series was scheduled as a mid-season replacement, and was rushed into production to meet the premiere date of April 9, 2009. Before the title Parks and Recreation was chosen, the name Public Service was considered, but ultimately rejected because network officials did not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> mocking the idea.|$|E
25|$|At the {{critical}} Battle of Naseby in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing {{with great success}} at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the Battle of Langport on 10 July, Cromwell participated in {{the defeat of the}} last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress Basing House, later <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender. Cromwell also took part in successful sieges at Bridgwater, Sherborne, Bristol, Devizes, and Winchester, then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in Devon and Cornwall. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the First English Civil War. Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at Oxford in June 1646.|$|E
500|$|English-speaking {{film critics}} were more lenient towards Afrikaans-language films lest they {{be accused of}} Boerehaat. According to The Star film critic Robert Greig, [...] "An apology {{situation}} developed with the English-language newspapers who tended not to slam Afrikaans films because they didn't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> boerehaat (Boer-hater)." [...] According to film critic Barry Ronge, [...] "The cries of boerehaat come from the industry itself when they feel they are not getting 'support'." ...|$|E

During this time, he <b>is</b> reported <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> mutiny on two separate occasions. On both occasions, however, he was excused from any punishment; it <b>is</b> believed due <b>to</b> his charm and wit as a comedian.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1243 {{or early}} 1244 (before 7 July 1244), Gerhard {{resigned}} as Grand Master.

500|$|Hardly a {{year had}} passed since Wills' return to Australia in 1856 without public comment on his suspect bowling action. As the most famous and outspoken colonial bowler <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> throwing, Wills became a [...] "convenient caricature" [...] of the cheat in cricket. He was cast as a villain for inciting a [...] "plague" [...] of throwing, {{especially}} among younger bowlers. For years his amateur status and [...] "transcendent skill" [...] had protected him, as had the collusion of Victorian newspapers, clubs and spectators, but now an ageing professional, the campaign against his throwing gathered strength.|$|E
500|$|However, some {{newspapers}} disagreed. The Baltimore Sun {{noted that}} Nixon [...] "did not deal {{in any way}} with the underlying question of propriety", while the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called the address [...] "a carefully contrived soap opera". Columnist Walter Lippmann called the wave of support for Nixon [...] "disturbing... with all the magnification of modern electronics, simply mob law"; discussing the speech with a dinner guest, he said, [...] "That must be the most demeaning experience my country has ever had to bear." [...] Columnist Thomas Stokes criticized Eisenhower for equivocating {{on the question of}} his running mate until [...] "the young man himself—the accused—had to step in and take over. And how he took over!" [...] Through his presidency, Eisenhower would continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> being indecisive.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, {{a battle}} raged {{in the letters}} pages of The Guardian and The Independent. In The Guardian on April 20, 1989, Hughes wrote the article [...] "The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace": [...] "In the years soon after [...] death, when {{scholars}} approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. But I learned my lesson early. [...] If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, {{in the hope of}} correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal {{to have anything to do}} with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech [...] The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know." [...] Hughes died in 1998.|$|E
