40|$|The {{rigorous}} thesis "Bedtime {{story and}} sleep! Regulating {{the use of}} television in raising children under 6 years of age", describes the way and intensity of how parents regulate children's TV viewing. However, since a TV set (as an object) in our households {{is not the only}} displaying device and television (as an institution) is not the only broadcaster of television contents, this thesis also includes watching TV programmes on other displaying devices such as computer, tablet, laptop and smartphone, which are connectable to the Internet. The chosen target group are children from 0 to 6 years of age. The thesis is based on two hypotheses. Firstly, parents use TV as a babysitter, and do so for various reasons. The second hypothesis assumes that parents do not pay attention to the time and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> that children watch, even {{at a very early age}} when children are most vulnerable. The theoretical part consists of two chapters. The first chapter describes the position and importance of a TV set (as an object), television (as an institution) and television programmes (as watched audiovisual contents) in our households, and deals with the influence of television on the socialisation of the child in the family. The second chapter describes both positive and negative influences of media (television [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Petroleum-related aid {{programmes}} {{and projects}} {{are a key}} part of donor activities in oil-rich developing countries. This paper critically assesses petroleum-related aid activities, using the Norwegian Oil for Development programme as a main case. Recent research suggests that institutions, or governance, are essential in averting a resource curse. While governance issues are beginning to receive more attention in these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> they still form a minor part <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> activities. The narrow sector focus that characterizes petroleum-related aid makes it unlikely that it will produce the higher order institutional changes needed to lift the resource curse. Petroleum-related aid activities address the issue of corruption only to a limited extent. Given the commercial and political interests of donor countries, questions about the integrity and credibility <b>of</b> these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> can be raised.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two years the UK {{government}} has been promoting the concept of ‘joined-up government’ as a way to improve service delivery and policy making in areas which affect people’s quality of life such as health, education and employment. The recent White Paper on Modernising Government reiterates the concept stating that modernisation in the national government can be achieved devising new ways of preparing policies and programmes that are based on the close relationship of different departments and agencies both at the national and local level. In practical terms joined-up government means that better services and better policy making can be achieved tackling issues such as health and crime in an integrated fashion. The joined-up government approach to deliver better public services at the local level has focused on both area-based programmes such as Action Zones in the areas of health, education and employment, and the New Deal for Communities; and group-based programmes such as the New Deal for the Young Unemployed and the Better Government for the Older People. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> stems from the recognition that areas of deprivation need a multi-agency and cross-sectoral approach for their regeneration. For instance the establishment of Health Action Zones is based on the notion that there is a link between health and inequalities and to improve areas of ill...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the channels through which unemployment determines young individuals ’ evolution in the labour market and the level to which the policy implemented to protect the young unemployed fulfills its purpose. The research will be centered in the Greek case; a very representative example of the complexity of the ways in which unemployment affects individuals ’ present and future welfare that has not been studied in depth yet. The Great Recession, being a major cause of a harsh and persistent rise in Greek unemployment, serves as a breeding ground for such an analysis. The main policy measures adopted to deal with youth unemployment are active labour market programmes, their specific targets being the creation of new jobs and the optimization of vocational training through the provision of subsidies to both employees and employers. In an attempt to investigate the impact of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> on the labour market outcomes for the participants, as well as the non-participants, both general and partial equilibrium effects will be investigated. Additionally, in order to get a clear picture of the consequences of unemployment for young educated people, the causal mechanisms which link unemployment to labour market prospects of young college graduates will be identified. In summary, the purpose {{of this study is to}} draw a clear picture of the aftermaths of such a socially harmful situation as unemployment for the youth who enter the labour market in a socioeconomic environment shaped by th...|$|E
40|$|The {{mass media}} - and {{especially}} the television - offer {{a wide range of}} various kinds of entertainment. Among frequent entertaining contents, there are various educational quizzes, typical especially for the television broadcasting. In my diploma thesis, I would like to deal just in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes.</b> The main assumption I am starting from is the fact that regardless of the function of a concrete television quiz, all these programmes have one thing in common: they demonstrate (often involuntarily) a relatively complete conception of the content of the general education. As a future teacher, I would like to deal in the issue what the content of the general education reflected in the contemporary television quizzes looks like. That is why I would like to elaborate concrete television quizzes by a thematic analysis of questions during a given period and find out the conception of the general education reflected in these programmes at the present time. I will observe the representation of every branch as well as the quality of knowledge required by the questions. I would like to evaluate to which extent the television quizzes of today require knowledge and consideration of circumstances and to which extent just fragmentary knowledge of unimportant details is considered to be enough. That means to find out whether the television quizzes can be linked with the educational function or whether they have mostly the entertaining function...|$|E
40|$|Child care centres in Malaysia {{that were}} {{surveyed}} in 1982 offer {{in varying degrees}} of comprehensiveness, conventional programmes of activities for children below 4. Such activities define essentially the local conception of 'preschooling' for children in this age group. It is argued in this paper that such definition of preschool education are based on scanty knowledge of child development as applicable to the local conditions and Malaysian infants. To some extent, established kindergarten curricula and parental expectations have shaped the activities planned for the very young who are sent to child care centres. Hence, variety rather than consistency characterise the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Programmes</b> provided by child care centres. There are three identifiable forms of child care agencies viz. institute, home and estate based. Institute-based centres are generally professionally organised bases sponsored by private or state and voluntary supports and are often large to middle sized projects. Home-based operators are largely small-scale and servioes are provided in the minders' residences. Estates have {{for a long time}} organised their nurseries and kindergartens for children of the labourers and large numbers are involved at these child care centres. Gross disparities characterise the various types of centres even in considering a few aspects such as, the available: activities and facilities to Support these. The problem engendered in the inequalities assume social overtones especially with the concentration of Indians in the estates which generally pay very little note to activities and child care programmes. Other ethnic groups predominated at the institutes which generally subscribed most strongly to schedules of activities and the home-based centres...|$|E
