5|$|Darwin {{experienced}} an earthquake in Chile and saw {{signs that the}} land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide.

5|$|Small {{groups of}} animals with little {{opportunity}} for exchange between them face {{the risk of}} inbreeding, decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, clear-cutting for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.|$|E

5|$|Age of Empires {{requires}} the player {{to develop a}} civilization {{from a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> are cut down will not grow back.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> make up the forest composition, and habitat fragmentation {{as a result of}} urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern goshawk.|$|E
40|$|A {{collection}} P of leaf-labelled trees {{is compatible}} if {{there exists a}} single leaf-labelled <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> displays each of the trees in P. Despite its difficulty, determining the compatibility of P is a fundamental task in evolutionary biology. Attractive characterizations in terms of chordal graphs have been previously given for this problem {{as well as for}} the problems of (i) determining if there is a unique <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> displays each of the <b>trees</b> in P, <b>that</b> is 'P is definitive and (ii) determining if there is a <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> displays P and has the property <b>that</b> every other <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> displays P is a refinement of it, that is 'P identifies a leaf-labelled tree. In this paper, we describe new characterizations of each of these problems in terms of edge colourings. Furthermore, for an arbitrary leaf-labelled tree 'T, we also determine the minimum number of 'quartets' required to identify 'T, thus correcting a previously published result...|$|R

5|$|Firewatch {{runs on the}} Unity game engine. Ng {{disapproved of}} the tools for {{creating}} trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the {{greatest}} of the Noldor, created the Silmarils in which he stored {{a part of the}} light of the Two <b>Trees</b> <b>that</b> were lighting Valinor. After three ages in the Halls of Mandos, Melkor was released, feigning reform. He however spread his evil and started to poison the minds of the Elves against the Valar. Eventually he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him Morgoth (S. The Black Enemy). Fëanor and his seven sons then swore to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.|$|E
5|$|In {{suitable}} environments, {{such as the}} Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, or {{the mixed}} podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community {{at the end of}} a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by taller plants, which in turn give way to <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> eventually form a forest canopy.|$|E

5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad never meant his poem to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or to the trees of any special region. Just any trees or all <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> might be rained on or snowed on, {{and that would be}} suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E
5|$|Settlement {{continued}} {{to follow the}} river down the valley. At the confluence with Castle Creek, the valley widened and offered a flood plain conducive {{to the development of}} a town. The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated, and very soon the mining camp became a small city, named Aspen after the <b>trees</b> <b>that</b> filled the surrounding forests. It grew rapidly, becoming the seat of the newly created Pitkin County, named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there.|$|E
