5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> a top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding {{to the effects of}} radiation sickness.|$|E

5|$|On June 16, nearly {{identical}} ultimata were issued to Latvia and Estonia, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> only eight hours to respond.

The thresholds are shown to <b>be</b> U-duality invariant. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> by a weight- 3 / 2 non holomorphic form of SL(3,Z) and a weight- 1 form of SL(2,Z) in the eight-dimensional case. In seven dimensions <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> by a weight- 3 / 2 form of SL(5,Z). We conjecture also formulae for the non-perturbative thresholds in lower dimensional compactifications...|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Vukovar, the JNA and its {{allied forces}} started taking all civilians {{remaining}} in Vukovar to the Velepromet camp, transferring them from various shelters {{elsewhere in the}} city. About 11:00 on 19 November, Cyrus Vance and Herbert S.
