Five years later, in 1992, a totally new Murray–Darling Basin Agreement was signed, replacing the River Murray Waters Agreement. The Agreement was given full legal status by the Murray–Darling Basin Act 1993 which was passed by all <b>the</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>governments.</b> Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory later joined the agreement.|$|E
