25|$|At its passage, the Act was {{politically}} controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, {{six members of}} Congress, including Republican Mark Hatfield, sued to prevent use of <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto. They were granted summary judgment by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that the Congressmen lacked standing {{because they could not}} show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in Raines v.

Within the next two months, Clinton began using <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto, prompting several entities to file suit in a second attempt to have the Act declared unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|One {{highlight}} of the debate occurred when Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani debated whether <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto was constitutional or not.

25|$|On {{that same}} day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave {{a press conference}} on <b>the</b> president’s <b>line-item</b> veto proposal. Bolten {{explained}} that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out “wasteful” spending and to put such spending on hold. While <b>the</b> spending <b>line-item</b> is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind <b>the</b> particular <b>line-item.</b> <b>The</b> proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.|$|R

25|$|Clinton v.

The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E
500|$|The Assembly {{passed a}} {{biennial}} budget, {{but did not}} allow enough time in the session to reconvene and potentially override any of Fletcher's vetoes. In an attempt to avoid [...] "excessive debt", Fletcher used his line-item veto to trim $370 million in projects from the budget passed by the Assembly. Although falling far short of his initial prediction of vetoing $938 million, Fletcher used <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto {{more than any other}} governor in state history. One project not vetoed by Fletcher was $11 million for the University of the Cumberlands to build a pharmacy school. LGBT rights groups had asked Fletcher to veto the funds because the university, a private Baptist school, had expelled a student for being openly gay.|$|E

50|$|Presidents are {{required}} to approve all of a bill or none of it; selective vetoes have been prohibited. In 1996, Congress gave President Bill Clinton a line-item veto over parts of a bill that required spending federal funds. The Supreme Court, in Clinton v. New York City, found Clinton's veto of pork-barrel appropriations for New York City to be unconstitutional because only a constitutional amendment could give <b>the</b> president <b>line-item</b> veto power.|$|R
50|$|When {{asked how}} this {{proposed}} legislation {{was different from}} <b>the</b> 1996 <b>Line-Item</b> Veto Act that the United States Supreme Court had declared illegal, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, for the President to successfully withdraw previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.|$|R
500|$|Thompson {{was elected}} Governor of Wisconsin in 1986. [...] He was re-elected three times.

[...] Thompson also successfully backed a school voucher program. [...] Near {{the end of}} his governorship, Thompson implemented BadgerCare, which provided health coverage for children ineligible for Medicaid. [...] As governor, Thompson vetoed bills frequently and often exercised <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto. [...] None of his vetoes were overturned.

500|$|As governor, Johnson {{followed}} a strict small-government approach. According to former New Mexico Republican National Committee member Mickey D. Barnett, [...] "Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose, his first response always {{was to ask}} if government {{should be involved in}} that to begin with." [...] He vetoed 200 of 424 bills passed in his first six months in office—a national record of 47% of all legislation—and used <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto on most remaining bills. [...] In office, Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10% annual growth of the state budget. [...] In his first budget, Johnson proposed a wide range of tax cuts, including a repeal of the prescription drug tax, a $47 million income tax cut, and a 6-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax cut. However, of these, only the gasoline tax cut was passed. During the November 1995 federal government shutdown, he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the budget deficit through proportional cuts across the budget. Although Johnson worked to reduce overall state spending, in his first term he raised education spending by nearly a third. [...] When drop-out rates and test scores showed little improvement, Johnson changed his tactics and began advocating school vouchers—a key issue in budget battles of his second term as governor.|$|E

In 1992, Skaggs found himself at the center of controversy, coming under fire for his 57 overdrafts from the House bank, more than the combined total {{of the rest of the}} Colorado delegation.|$|R
5000|$|The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 [...] was {{a federal}} law of the United States that granted the President <b>the</b> power to <b>line-item</b> veto budget bills passed by Congress, but its effect was brief as the act was soon ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Clinton v.

50|$|The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 {{gave the}} {{president}} <b>the</b> power of <b>line-item</b> veto, which President Bill Clinton {{applied to the}} federal budget 82 times before the law was struck down in 1998 by the Supreme Court {{on the grounds of}} it being in violation of the Presentment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.|$|R

2500|$|Though {{the newer}} line-item veto {{proposal}} was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless {{failed to find}} strong support in Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia called it [...] "an offensive slap at Congress," [...] asserting that the legislation would enable the president to intimidate individual members of Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto as proposed would take away Congress’ constitutional [...] "power of the purse" [...] {{and give it to}} the Executive branch.|$|E
2500|$|The Recommendation clause {{imposes a}} duty, but its {{performance}} rests solely with the President. Congress possesses {{no power to}} compel the President to recommend, as he alone is the [...] "judge" [...] of what is [...] "necessary and expedient." [...] Unlike the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article I, which limits Congress's discretion to carrying out only its delegated powers, the phrase [...] "necessary and expedient" [...] implies {{a wider range of}} discretion for the President. Because this is a political question, there has been little judicial involvement with the President's actions under the clause as long as Presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the Supreme Court noted that the Recommendations Clause serves as a reminder that the President cannot make law by himself: [...] "The power to recommend legislation, granted to the President, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the Congress to legislate." [...] The Court made a similar point in striking down <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto in Clinton v. City of New York (1998). When President Bill Clinton attempted to shield the records of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform as essential to his functions under the Recommendations Clause, a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in Ass'n of American Physicians & Surgeons v. Clinton (1993): [...] "he Recommendation Clause is less an obligation than a right. The President has the undisputed authority to recommend legislation, but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or, for that matter, any subject." ...|$|E
50|$|Since then, the {{prospect}} of granting <b>the</b> President a <b>line-item</b> veto has occasionally resurfaced in Congress, either through a constitutional amendment or a differently worded bill.

50|$|Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain {{introduced}} legislation {{of a limited}} version of <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto.

50|$|Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto {{argue that}} the {{provision}} would make the President more accountable for federal spending. Also, <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto {{can be used to}} prevent the enactment of controversial rider amendments that powerful legislators have sometimes inserted into important bills, or at least {{it can be used to}} ensure that someone elected at the national level is accountable for the enactment of such amendments. Without <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto, Presidents have often felt compelled to sign controversial riders into law even if they did not support them. Bob Barr's former 2008 Libertarian Party running mate Wayne Root has also endorsed <b>the</b> <b>line-item</b> veto to go with his libertarian political views on spending while also suggesting the lifting of the Congressional ban on presidents impounding bills.|$|E

40|$|In many states, tax and {{expenditure}} limits constrain government spending. All but {{one state}} have adopted balanced-budget rules. Some governors {{have the power}} to veto individual budget items (<b>the</b> so-called <b>line-item</b> veto). This article reviews the evidence linking fiscal and political institutions to state taxation, spending, and debt. It appears that properly designed fiscal and political institutions are effective in containing the growth of state government. Constitutional tax and expenditure limits have been more successful than spending constraints established legislatively. Balanced-budget rules that pro-hibit deficit carryover to the following fiscal year are superior to rules that allow deficit carryover. Researchers have identified two other relationships. First, there is evidence that fiscal rules reduce state borrowing costs. Second, the citizen initiative process has played a role in controlling spending: states with a citizen initiative process spend less. State Spending and Fiscal Controls In the United States, state government spending has grown rapidly, nearly doubling since 1995. Population and prices have grown as well, but at a much slower rate. The result has been a significant expansion in real per capita state government expenditures. Although the fi-nances of state governments have improved considerably in the las...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This paper {{considers}} large-scale stochastic simulations with correlated inputs having normal-to-anything (NORTA) distributions with arbitrary continuous marginal distributions. Examples of correlated inputs include processing times of workpieces across several workcenters in manufacturing facilities and product demands and exchange rates in global supply chains. Our {{goal is to}} obtain mean performance measures and confidence intervals for simulations with such correlated inputs by accounting for the uncertainty around the NORTA distribution parameters estimated from finite historical input data. This type of uncertainty {{is known as the}} parameter uncertainty in the discrete-event stochastic simulation literature. We demonstrate how to capture parameter uncertainty with a Bayesian model that uses Sklar’s marginal-copula representation and Cooke’s copula-vine specification for sampling the parameters of the NORTA distribution. The development of such a Bayesian model well suited for handling many correlated inputs is the primary contribution of this paper. We incorporate the Bayesian model into the simulation replication algorithm for the joint representation of stochastic uncertainty and parameter uncertainty in the mean performance estimate and the confidence interval. We show that our model improves both the consistency of <b>the</b> mean <b>line-item</b> fill-rate estimates and the coverage of the confidence intervals in multiproduct inventory simulations with correlated demands...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of programme-targeted method {{in the budget}} process in Ukraine demonstrates the difference between public administration using programs (budget programs) and based on programme management. The budget program has {{the structure of a}} programme document, but the content corresponds to <b>the</b> reformatting <b>line-item</b> budget. There are two main problems of application of the programme management methodology in fiscal policy: a sequence of programme objectives and heterogeneity of time. For fiscal policy the selection and distribution of programme objectives (results, effects) in space and time is a key component of management. Despite the complexity and uncertainty of any calculation of the programme product cost should take into account that the sequence of the outcomes affects the total programme result. In this context, the choice of performance, productivity and efficiency indicators based on different time of occurrence and characteristics of the result, product and effect of the financial instruments use to govern financial mechanism as part of the programme management. Results should be evaluated on the ability to become a product that takes effect. The effect of the financial tools application is spaced in time from the result. Efficiency should not be understood as a ratio, but as the correlation with the anticipated cost (value) remote effect, which does not coincide with the result of the programme delivered on time...|$|R
