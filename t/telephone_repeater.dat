50|$|This {{is used to}} {{increase}} the range of telephone signals in a telephone line. They are most frequently used in trunklines that carry long distance calls. In an analog telephone line consisting {{of a pair of}} wires, it consists of an amplifier circuit made of transistors which use power from a DC current source {{to increase}} the power of the alternating current audio signal on the line. Since the telephone is a duplex (bidirectional) communication system, the wire pair carries two audio signals, one going in each direction. So <b>telephone</b> <b>repeaters</b> have to be bilateral, amplifying the signal in both directions without causing feedback, which complicates their design considerably. <b>Telephone</b> <b>repeaters</b> were the first type of repeater and were some of the first applications of amplification.

5000|$|De Forest and {{everybody}} else at the time greatly underestimated the potential of his original device, imagining it {{to be limited to}} mostly military applications.

50|$|The {{development}} of audio communication technology {{in form of}} the telephone, first patented in 1876, created the need to increase the amplitude of electrical signals to extend the transmission of signals over increasingly long distances. In telegraphy, this problem had been solved with intermediate devices at stations that replenished the dissipated energy by operating a signal recorder and transmitter back-to-back, forming a relay, so that a local energy source at each intermediate station powered the next leg of transmission.For duplex transmission, i.e. sending and receiving in both directions, bi-directional relay repeaters were developed starting {{with the work of}} C.

5000|$|Carbon {{microphones}} {{can be used}} as amplifiers. This capability {{was used}} in early <b>telephone</b> <b>repeaters,</b> making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tube amplifiers. In these <b>repeaters,</b> a magnetic <b>telephone</b> receiver (an electrical-to-mechanical transducer) was mechanically coupled to a carbon microphone. Because a carbon microphone works by varying a current passed through it, instead of generating a signal voltage as with most other microphone types, this arrangement could be used to boost weak signals and send them down the line. These amplifiers were mostly abandoned with the development of vacuum tubes, which offered higher gain and better sound quality. Even after vacuum tubes were in common use, carbon amplifiers continued to be used during the 1930s in portable audio equipment such as hearing aids. The Western Electric 65A carbon amplifier was 1.2" [...] in diameter and 0.4" [...] high and weighed less than 1.4 ounces. Such carbon amplifiers did not require the heavy bulky batteries and power supplies used by vacuum tube amplifiers. By the 1950s, carbon amplifiers for hearing aids had been replaced by miniature vacuum tubes (only to be shortly replaced by transistors). However, carbon amplifiers are still being produced and sold.|$|R

40|$|<b>Telephone</b> <b>repeaters</b> are {{bi-directional}} amplifiers {{which are}} inserted in a transmission line {{to compensate for}} losses. Because of their bi-directional nature special {{care must be taken}} to match these amplifiers to the line in order to assure stability and to limit the echo signal. The two basic types of repeaters presently in use are the hybrid and the negative impedance repeaters. In this study a new arrangement, called the bridge compensated repeater, is suggested and analyzed. After developing an analytical method by which the performance of repeaters of various types can be compared, the three systems are analyzed and it is proved that the bridge compensated system possesses some desirable properties as compared to existing systems. The basic problem in designing a bridge compensated system is the design of a two-port network which must satisfy a specification related to its real and imaginary parts simultaneously. A computer method for designing such networks is developed and some results are presented. A circuit for the bridge compensated repeater is described and measuring techniques are developed to compare the accuracy of calculated and measured values. This technique is demonstrated on a simple system in which case the agreement between measured and calculated values is found to be very good...|$|R

5000|$|Graph {{theory has}} been used in the network {{analysis}} of linear, passive networks almost from the moment that Kirchhoff's laws were formulated. Gustav Kirchhoff himself, in 1847, used graphs as an abstract representation of a network in his loop analysis of resistive circuits. [...] This approach was later generalised to RLC circuits, replacing resistances with impedances. In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell provided the dual of this analysis with node analysis. [...] Maxwell is also responsible for the topological theorem that the determinant of the node-admittance matrix is equal to the sum of all the tree admittance products. In 1900 Henri Poincaré introduced the idea of representing a graph by its incidence matrix, hence founding the field of algebraic topology. In 1916 Oswald Veblen applied the algebraic topology of Poincaré to Kirchhoff's analysis. [...] Veblen is also responsible for the introduction of the spanning tree to aid choosing a compatible set of network variables.Comprehensive cataloguing of network graphs as they apply to electrical circuits began with Percy MacMahon in 1891 (with an engineer friendly article in The Electrician in 1892) who limited his survey to series and parallel combinations.

In 1940, Amado Trinidad Velazco became the owner and various Cuban stations merged with CMHI, among which were CMCF and CMKO thus forming Radio Habana Cuba, with its offices at Prado #54, corner of Capdevila Street.

2500|$|At {{this time}} the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was researching ways to amplify {{telephone}} signals to provide better long-distance service, and it was recognized that de Forest's device had potential as a <b>telephone</b> line <b>repeater.</b> In mid-1912 an associate, John Stone Stone, contacted AT to arrange for de Forest to demonstrate his invention. It was found that de Forest's [...] "gassy" [...] version of the Audion could not handle even the relatively low voltages used by telephone lines. (Due {{to the way he}} constructed the tubes, de Forest's Audions would cease to operate with too high a vacuum.) However, careful research by Dr. Harold D. Arnold and his team at AT's Western Electric subsidiary determined that by improving the tube's design, it could be more fully evacuated, and the high vacuum allowed it to successfully operate at telephone line voltages. With these changes the Audion evolved into a modern electron-discharge vacuum tube, using electron flows rather than ions. (Dr. Irving Langmuir at the General Electric Corporation made similar findings, and both he and Arnold attempted to patent the [...] "high vacuum" [...] construction, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1931 that this modification could not be patented).|$|R
