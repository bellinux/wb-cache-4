5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the viral particle {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. <b>This</b> <b>region</b> of the viral genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in <b>this</b> <b>region</b> prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E
