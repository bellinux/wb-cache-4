His ability to have a [...] "feminine gender schema" [...] despite his having male genes, substantiates the constructionist {{position}} that gender identity is fully dependent on outer influences. However, when Callie discovers {{that he could have}} been raised as a boy, he renounces his female gender, recognizing his chosen gender identity as a male. Disowning <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> before he learned about masculine traits bolsters the argument for the [...] "essentialist ideology of identity". Cal's embrace of his inherent male identity and renunciation of his childhood female gender identity is articulated when he reflects, [...] "I never felt out of place being a girl, I still don't feel entirely at home among men." ...|$|E
500|$|Shuichi, {{one of two}} protagonists, is a young, effeminate {{child who}} at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son is in the fifth grade of elementary school. Otherwise known by the nicknames [...] and , Shuichi was assigned male at birth, but wants to be a girl and often cross-dresses to assume the role of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>gender.</b> Shuichi is described as cute by many of the other characters and is able to appear as a girl when cross-dressing, because of a feminine-looking face and physical build. Shuichi enjoys wearing cute clothes; although initially not a cross-dresser, Shuichi's friends Yoshino Takatsuki and Saori Chiba encourage Shuichi to dress and act femininely. As Shuichi grows up, puberty becomes a topic of increasing concern, such as the growth of body hair, a deepening voice, and the onset of pimples. Shuichi exhibits signs of gender dysphoria and displays an outward attraction to two girls in the series—Yoshino and Anna Suehiro. Shuichi and Anna date for a time in junior high, until she breaks off their relationship. However, the two soon resume their relationship with each other.|$|E

2500|$|Alice H. Eagly and Steven J. Karau (2002) {{argue that}} [...] "perceived incongruity between <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> role and {{leadership}} roles leads to {{two forms of}} prejudice: (a) perceiving women less favorably than men as potential occupants of leadership roles and (b) evaluating behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a leader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman. One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are {{that it is more}} difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles." [...] Moreover, research suggests that when women are acknowledged to have been successful, they are less liked and more personally derogated than equivalently successful men. Assertive women who display masculine, agentic traits are viewed as violating prescriptions of feminine niceness and are penalized for violating the status order.|$|E

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} in the last section, men and women, when dating, have goals and expectations. They are looking for certain qualities and characteristics. Eventually, both are {{looking for someone to}} spend the rest of their lives with. But in the meantime they are looking for different qualities and characteristics in a person that they wish to have as their immediate companion. According to the study done by Alice Eagly, a professor in Psychology at Northwestern University and Wendy Wood, also a professor in the same department, about sex differences in human behavior, they give the idea that both men and women are looking for certain attractiveness that fits their taste and style. The study states “the value of attractiveness stems from its perceived association with the ability to provide sexual pleasure.” This means that attractiveness suggests information about “sexual warmth” or sexual arousal. The study then proceeds to say that if this is true, then men will seek sexiness in a partner. In addition they will also look for characteristics such as domestic skills. However, Wood and Eagly go on to say “given that <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> role contains sexual restraint and lacks sexual autonomy, women place less importance on sexiness in a partner.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fairy tale}} of Sleeping Beauty has been {{analyzed}} by folklorists and other scholars of various types, {{and many of}} them have noticed prominent erotic elements of the story. Some versions of the tale have Beauty raped and pregnant while sleeping, and only waking up after childbirth. The child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim commented that the tale [...] "abounds with Freudian symbolism" [...] and that the princes who try to reach Sleeping Beauty before the appropriate time only to perish in the thorns surrounding her castle serves as a warning that premature sexual encounters are destructive. Feminist theorists have focused on Sleeping Beauty's extreme passivity and the sexual nature of her awakening in the fairy tale. Anne Rice literalized these symbolic sexual elements—particularly, the passive sexual awakening or rape of Beauty that has been denounced by feminists—in the story by rewriting it into an explicit sadomasochistic erotica. However, Rice's cross-gender identification with the submissive male characters with receptive capacity in the trilogyAlexi, Tristan and Laurentenabled her to circumvent the equation of <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> and masochism and, via their homoerotic interactions with the dominant male characters, she could exploit the erotic potential of phallic power {{while at the same time}} going beyond its boundary and [...] "turning it against itself".|$|E

She was a member of the Reverend Frank's congregation, and made a point of distinguishing herself in that body, by conspicuously weeping at everything, however cheering, said by the Reverend Frank in his public ministration; also by applying to herself the various lamentations of David, and complaining in a personally injured manner (much in arrear of the clerk and the rest of the respondents) that her enemies were digging pit-falls about her, and breaking her with rods of iron. Indeed, this old widow discharged herself of that portion of the Morning and Evening Service as if she were lodging a complaint on oath and applying for a warrant before a magistrate. But this was not her most inconvenient characteristic, for that took the form of an impression, usually recurring in inclement weather and at about daybreak, that she had something on her mind and stood in immediate need of the Reverend Frank to come and take it off. Many a time had that kind creature got up, and gone out to Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple's name), suppressing a strong sense of her comicality by his strong sense of duty, and perfectly knowing that nothing but a cold would come of it. However, beyond themselves, the Reverend Frank Milvey and Mrs Milvey seldom hinted that Mrs Sprodgkin was hardly worth the trouble she gave; but both made the best of her, as they did of all their troubles.|$|E

Transcripts from one-on-one, semi-structured interviews conducted with 14 retired men (aged 59 to 84) in a small northwestern Ontario city were analyzed using constructivist methodology. Interview questions focused on participants' experiences throughout the life course (i. e. marriage, retirement, illness) in addition to their perceptions of masculinity and gender roles.

Those communicating these details to the American public through mass media are doing so with gendered discourse. This study analyzes three speeches from predominant climate change communicators representing three different platforms: politician Al Gore, cultural figure Leonardo DiCaprio, and climate scientist James Hansen. Using discourse analysis informed by feminist standpoint theory, this study suggests that frames, words, phrases, and communication styles embedded in discussions of climate change continue to use gendered language reflecting patriarchy (Hallstein, 1999; Harding, 1986). Gendered climate change discourse reflects male worldview (Bee, 2013), muting <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>gender’s</b> voice and way to frame its occurrence.

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the gendered character of public talk {{as a way to}} account for women's variable participation in the settings that make up the public sphere. Public settings for citizen talk such as radio call-in shows, social networking sites, letters to the editor, and town hall meetings are culturally coded female or male. In feminized settings, where the people who organize public talk are from feminized professions and where the favored modes of talk and action emphasize stereotypically feminine values, women are likely to be as active and influential participants as men.
