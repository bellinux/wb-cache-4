[...] Nevertheless, the marriage was a success. [...] Eliza understood her husband and did not complain about his frequent absences. [...] The couple had one son, Edward Fleming Sheffey, (1865–1933), who became a successful Lynchburg businessman. [...] He remembered as a boy telling his father, “Uncle Johnny thinks <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> {{to spend more time}} with your family,” to which Sheffey replied, “Son, Uncle Johnny doesn’t know which way the rats run. [...] The Lord will take care of you.” [...] Eventually even the Staffords were reconciled to the marriage.|$|E
