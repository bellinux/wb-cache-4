5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> {{the only one of}} the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there is a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E
25|$|Flutie {{became the}} Buffalo Bills' quarterback five games into the 1998 season. The Bills were {{initially}} uninterested in signing him, but then-pro personnel director A.J. Smith convinced {{the organization that}} Flutie {{would be a great}} asset to the team. In his first action with the Bills, Flutie entered for an injured Rob Johnson and passed for two TDs while leading a fourth-quarter comeback against the Indianapolis Colts on October 11, 1998. The following week, Doug Flutie made his first NFL start since October 15, 1989, against the unbeaten Jacksonville Jaguars. The nine-year gap between starts for a quarterback in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> the third-longest in duration behind Tommy Maddox (December 12, 1992 to October 6, 2002) and Todd Collins (December 14, 1997 to December 16, 2007). Flutie was the hero of the Bills' victory as he scored the winning touchdown against the Jaguars by rolling out on a bootleg and into the end zone on a fourth-down play in the waning seconds. The Bills' success continued with Flutie at the helm; his record as a starter that season was 8 wins and 3 losses. Flutie was selected to play in the 1998 Pro Bowl, and is currently the shortest quarterback to make the Pro Bowl since 1970.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, McCoy said {{he would}} stay at Texas for his senior year instead of leaving for the 2009 NFL Draft. McCoy was quoted as saying, [...] "I'm going to play here for four years.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> {{very active}} on {{stopping}} {{what it says}} is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms [...] "NFL", [...] "Super Bowl", and [...] "Super Sunday". As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with colloquialisms such as [...] "The Big Game", or other generic descriptions. [...] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying [...] "it would be super...to have a bowl...of Planters nuts while watching the big game!" [...] and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the [...] "Superb Owl". [...] In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for [...] "Superb Owl". [...] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase [...] "Super Bowl" [...] implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that [...] "promote a message", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55inches. Some critics say <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that [...] "any use is prohibited", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States. Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 [...] "to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games", and [...] "for other purposes".|$|E

[...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. <b>The</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E

Lang openly admitted that his team was considering going on strike if the lockout was not resolved. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers responded by saying, [...] "First of all, I've got to do something that <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> not going to do: I have to apologize to the fans. Our sport is a multi-billion dollar machine, generated by people who pay good money to come watch us play. The product on the field is not being complemented by an appropriate set of officials.
