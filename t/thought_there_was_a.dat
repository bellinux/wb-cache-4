500|$|The orthogenesis {{hypothesis}} had {{a significant}} following in the 19th century when evolutionary mechanisms such as Lamarckism were being proposed. The French zoologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) himself accepted the idea, {{and it had a}} central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, the hypothesized mechanism of which resembled the [...] "mysterious inner force" [...] of orthogenesis. Orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who saw in their fossils a directional change, and in invertebrate paleontology <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gradual and constant directional change. [...] Those who accepted orthogenesis in this way, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism that drove orthogenesis was teleological (had a definite goal). Charles Darwin himself rarely used the term [...] "evolution" [...] now so commonly used to describe his theory, because the term was strongly associated with orthogenesis, as had been common usage since at least 1647.|$|E

500|$|It {{was unknown}} how the remains had settled at the location; the body might either {{have been placed}} at the beach or have drifted in the water from another location, some presuming from as far as Canada. The United States Coast Guard entered the {{investigation}} and analyzed the currents {{of the water in}} the area to estimate where the bag containing the remains could have originated from. Dive teams were also used around the time the body was discovered. As of mid-July and August, authorities believed the victim had been placed at the scene, rather than washing onto Deer Island from another location, because the body was not in an advanced enough stage of decomposition. The beach is near a waste-water treatment plant. One of the investigators <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> possibility that the disposal had been performed by an employee of the nearby water treatment plant.

500|$|Once {{he became}} Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker insisted on {{exceptionally}} tight {{control over his}} client's career. Songwriter Robert B. Sherman (of the Sherman Brothers) bore witness to the deal being forged between Hill and Range co-owner Jean Aberbach and The Colonel in 1955. Early on, [...] "The Colonel" [...] and his Hill and Range allies, the brothers Jean and Julian Aberbach, perceived the close relationship that developed between Presley and songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as {{a serious threat to}} that control. Parker effectively ended the relationship, deliberately or not, with the new contract he sent Leiber in early 1958.

[...] "There's no mistake, boy, just sign it and return it," [...] Parker directed. [...] "Don't worry, we'll fill it in later." [...] Leiber declined, and Presley's fruitful collaboration with the writing team was over. Other respected songwriters lost interest in or simply avoided writing for Presley because of the requirement that they surrender a third of their usual royalties.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{composition}} of the fauna Achelousaurus was part of is uncertain, as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa. Its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that Achelousaurus shared its habitat with forms roughly found in the middle or {{at the end of}} the time range of its formation. As with horned dinosaurs, Horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of the Two Medicine Formation. One of these was a form in between Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus; in 1994 he would name it Hypacrosaurus stebingeri. [...] Today, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri is no longer seen as having evolved through anagenesis because autapomorphies of the species have been identified. Horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as indicative for a taxon in between Stegoceras and Pachycephalosaurus; these have not been consistently referred to a new genus. Finally, Horner <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> taxon present that was transitional between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. In 2017, tyrannosaurid remains from the Two Medicine Formation were named as a new species of Daspletosaurus: Daspletosaurus horneri. The 2017 study considered it plausible that D. horneri was a direct descendant of D. torosus in a process of anagenesis, but rejected the possibility that D. horneri was the ancestor of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{started in}} February 2012. Hooper {{investigated}} filming the feature in 3D, and performed some camera tests {{before deciding to}} film it with traditional 2D methods. He stated [...] " [...] I slightly worry with 3D that some people will physically struggle with it. If you have {{a certain type of}} eyesight it can be more demanding than watching a normal movie." [...] Unlike other musical films, Les Misérables features the actors singing live on camera, rather than miming to backing vocals. Hooper told Los Angeles Times that he <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "slightly strange falseness" [...] when he saw musical films where the actors sang to recordings. The actors wore wireless earpieces on set so they could sing to accompanying piano music. Hooper believed this method allowed the actors to have emotional control over their songs: [...] "When Annie [...] is singing 'I Dreamed a Dream', if she needs to take a tenth of a second to have a thought before she sings it, or to have an emotion before she sings a line, she can take it." [...] The actors also performed their songs in recitative style, which Hooper likened to being immersed in a 3D film. Les Miserables was released in North America on 25 December 2012, and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.|$|E

500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed by Simon Cowell to a £2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne. In February 2011, One Direction and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, RedOne, Toby Gad and Rami Yacoub, among others. The album also features songs written by Ed Sheeran, Kelly Clarkson, and Tom Fletcher. In May 2011, Kotecha spoke to Digital Spy, and he elaborated that One Direction were [...] "experimenting" [...] with sounds on their debut album. Kotecha {{said that he was}} involved in the [...] "early stages" [...] of producing the record.

500|$|Supervising {{animator}} Glen Keane designed Rapunzel {{under the}} tutelage of veteran animator Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. Johnston advised Keane to attempt to capture what Rapunzel is thinking as opposed to simply animating what the character is doing after reviewing one of his early pencil tests. Keane compared receiving this advice to receiving a [...] "slap that I never forgot, so when I was drawing over people's work, I really tried to get into the head of the thinking of the character". Co-director Byron Howard was inspired by the appearance of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), a character who was also animated by Keane. Howard elaborated that [...] "Ariel was the first character that I ever <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to". Meanwhile, Keane observed that Ariel and Rapunzel also share [...] "irrepressible" [...] spirits while encountering barriers that prevent them from pursuing their dreams. Keane was inspired by a book about the idea of feminine beauty; the book cited [...] "strangeness" [...] as [...] "the key to beauty ... in a woman's face." [...] Taking this into consideration, Keane maintained a sense of asymmetry while drawing Rapunzel, incorporating into her face several subtle imperfections, specifically her bucked teeth. The character was also drawn with freckles, making her the first Disney princess to have this feature. Keane designed Rapunzel with large eyes in order to convey her [...] "irrepressible quality", a trait her also discovered in Mandy Moore's voice. The animators created nine different versions of Rapunzel before finally settling on a design with which they were satisfied. Although Moore has observed some physical similairites between the character and herself, she maintains that Rapunzel's appearance was developed long before she became involved with the project, dismissing any similarities as [...] "coincidental".|$|E

500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month hiatus at the {{beginning}} of 2006, From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox. In September 2006, the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become Holding a Wolf by the Ears. Brian McTernan was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project Biology's album, and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums. As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album, Mark noted that Perri [...] "never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement. But that was also the way it was when we wrote Abandon Your Friends." [...] Perri had then declared that he would no longer {{be a part of the}} band. [...] As Mark explains, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> more considerate way he could have gone about leaving the band", but it was ultimately [...] "cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have the passion for the band anymore." [...] Deciding to move on without Perri as a member, Mark then became lead vocalist, providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums. [...] Mark, as the band's lyricist explained that he [...] "work very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics" [...] and found that a part of him did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing, however, with Perri's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks, [...] "It immediately seemed like that’s the way things had been all along". Mark stated the bulk of the album's lyrics had been [...] "just about living" [...] and [...] "the idea that extremes are dangerous." [...] Recorded in about a month's time, Holding a Wolf by the Ears was named for the quotation by Thomas Jefferson, [...] "But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other." [...] Reviewer Drew Beringer of Absolute Punk had praised the change in the band's line up, stating that [...] "Mark is three times the front man Perri was", and gave [...] "passion that had been severely lacking while Perri was in the band." ...|$|E
