25|$|In {{the centre}} panel, Mary {{is shown in}} a red robe holding the Christ's lifeless long body. Saint Peter and Luke the Evangelist stand {{on either side of}} her. Both are dressed in black clothes, and represent, the {{foundation}} of the early Church and the Gospels, respectively. The right-hand panel shows the moment (not in any of the Gospels) when Christ appears to his mother after his Resurrection, which is repeated at a smaller scale in the distance through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> at rear. Although van der Weyden had otherwise presented the chronology of the triptych from left to right, the background resurrection is {{to the right of the}} Appearance in the foreground. The sequence is suggested by the picture's depth (in that the scene in the foreground is chronologically the more recent), and by the long winding path that leads from the tomb to the interior.|$|E
500|$|To {{the rear}} and at right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez(8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, {{and head of the}} royal {{tapestry}} works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. As the art critic Harriet Stone observes, it is uncertain whether he is [...] "coming or going". He is rendered in silhouette and appears to hold open a curtain on a short flight of stairs, with an unclear wall or space behind. Both this backlight and <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> reveal space behind: {{in the words of the}} art historian Analisa Leppanen, they lure [...] "our eyes inescapably into the depths". The royal couple's reflection pushes in the opposite direction, forward into the picture space. The vanishing point of the perspective is in the doorway, as can be shown by extending the line of the meeting of wall and ceiling on the right. Nieto is seen only by the king and queen, who share the viewer's point of view, and not by the figures in the foreground. In the footnotes of Joel Snyder's article, the author recognizes that Nieto is the queen's attendant and was required to be at hand to open and close doors for her. Snyder suggests that Nieto appears in the doorway so that the king and queen might depart. In the context of the painting, Snyder argues that the scene is the end of the royal couple's sitting for Velázquez and they are preparing to exit, explaining that is [...] "why the menina to the right of the Infanta begins to curtsy".|$|E
2500|$|Only a {{small number}} of people were at the {{airstrip}} and saw the crash. [...] The airport groundsman and an airline staff member grabbed portable fire extinguishers, jumped into a car and raced across the airstrip. Others at the airstrip and nearby beaches ran towards the burning aircraft. [...] The aircraft's cabin door had been torn away by a tree stump and lay about [...] behind the aircraft but despite <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> no-one inside the passenger cabin attempted to escape. [...] Fuel floating {{on the surface of the}} water was burning fiercely, making it dangerous to approach the wreckage. One of the first witnesses to reach the scene believed he saw two people at the front of the passenger cabin who were alive but before he could get close enough to investigate he was driven back by flames.|$|E
60|$|Arthur listened. He {{could not}} help it. He heard the girl's clear, {{distinct}} voice; <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> conveyed every word to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "So Pete Lownie's gone," [...] said Jess, whom I {{could not}} see from ben the house. I had a good glimpse of Tibbie, however, through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorways.</b> She had <b>the</b> {{armchair}} on the south side, as she would have said, of the fireplace.|$|R
6000|$|... [HORNBLOWER with a {{stare at}} HILLCRIST'S half-smiling face, [...] takes CHLOE'S arm, and half drags her {{towards the door}} on the [...] Left. But there, in <b>the</b> <b>opened</b> <b>doorway,</b> are {{standing}} DAWKER [...] and a STRANGER. They move just {{out of the way of}} the exit, [...] looking at CHLOE, who sways and very nearly falls.] ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} most RPO cars was a hook {{that could be}} used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side mail crane at smaller towns where the train did not stop. [...] The first US patent for such a device (...) was awarded to L.F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867. With the train often operating at 70mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station. [...] In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging mail pouch while the clerk stood in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b> [...] As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound mail pouch out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train. [...] An employee of the local post office would retrieve the pouch and deliver it to the post office.|$|E
60|$|Through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> {{they heard}} Aline's {{voice in the}} hall.|$|E
60|$|We kept {{ourselves}} {{concealed in}} the shadow of the recess, and looked through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hope surged high in {{the breast}} of Gahan of Gathol, of Turan the panthan. Furtively his eyes sought <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorways.</b> There {{was no one in}} sight. Ah, if he could but gain his freedom! He would find some way from this odious city back to her side and never again would he leave her until he had won safety for her or death for himself.|$|R
60|$|And {{she clung}} to him convulsively. It was such an {{affecting}} scene Jerry had to turn away, while Mrs. Flannigan, standing in <b>the</b> partly <b>open</b> <b>doorway,</b> shed copious tears.|$|R
60|$|Tom glanced through <b>the</b> {{slightly}} <b>opened</b> <b>doorway,</b> as he {{tightened his}} belt, and saw Betty {{and a boy}} of about fourteen years of age standing at a table, busily engaged loading several old-fashioned horse-pistols with buckshot.|$|R
60|$|There was a wistful sound, as {{of breath}} {{escaping}} hurriedly. Mr. Stone {{was standing in}} <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ditmar sat idle {{for some}} minutes {{after she had}} gone, staring through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> into the outer office....|$|E
60|$|Walking {{slowly and}} on tiptoe, I picked {{my way through}} the {{weed-grown}} garden, and peered through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{young man}} {{came out of}} the Victoria station, looking undecidedly at the taxi-cabs, dark-red and black, {{pressing}} against the kerb under the glass-roof. Several men in greatcoats and brass buttons jerked themselves erect to catch his attention, at the same time {{keeping an eye on the}} other people as they filtered through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> of <b>the</b> station. Berry, however, was occupied by one of the men, a big, burly fellow whose blue eyes glared back and whose red-brown moustache bristled in defiance.|$|R
60|$|From {{the barn}} Ben {{moved to the}} {{building}} next door--which {{was a sort of}} dwelling and storehouse combined. Here, from <b>the</b> wide <b>open</b> <b>doorway,</b> he gazed at the scene of destruction before him. It was full of horror and made him shiver.|$|R
60|$|There was an unsuspected {{listener}} to this conversation. Lawrence {{had come}} in from the field for a drink, and was standing in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> kitchen <b>doorway,</b> within easy earshot of the women's shrill tones.|$|R
60|$|Then, as the cab stopped, and <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> of the {{staircase}} was before her, all her courage came back.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{a mighty}} big boy!" [...] sneered the store-keeper, but all {{noticed that he}} retreated several steps toward <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Simultaneously Billy Byrne and Bridge dodged through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway,</b> banged {{the door}} to behind them, and sped across the barroom toward the street.|$|E
6000|$|... (Through {{the window}} {{the figure of}} a woman is seen running across the [...] lawn, and a moment later MINNIE FARRELL comes in through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> [...] <b>doorway,</b> upper right. She is breathless and {{somewhat}} wet.) ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{loading dock}} showing a {{warehouse}}, [s. d. ]. A long warehouse {{runs from the}} right foreground to the left background while three of <b>the</b> large <b>doorways</b> are <b>open</b> at right. <b>The</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorways</b> are numbered three, four and five while crates sit on a cart {{in front of the}} entryway at right. A tangle of rope can be seen sitting on the ground at right while "No Smoking" is painted along the exterior of the building.

60|$|Presently {{the picture}} in <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>opened</b> its mouth and spoke in a {{singularly}} measured, gentle voice.|$|R
6000|$|The second speaker {{turned his}} head from <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> where he was leaning, as if {{listening}} to something in the darkness, and answered abstractedly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|It did {{not take}} him long to reach the new vault and a glance through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> showed him that his bird had flown.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I must congratulate you, Miss Sharpe," [...] said Mainwaring with {{an attempt}} at interest, but his {{attention}} still preoccupied with <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
60|$|The bright morning, {{the shady}} streets, the homelike frame and log houses, the old-time {{fragrant}} odor of cornpone wafted out of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorways,</b> <b>the</b> warm greetings,--all made me {{happy to be}} back again. Mr. Crede rushed out and escorted us into his cool store, and while he waited on his country customers bade his negro brew a bowl of toddy, {{at the mention of}} which Mr. Bill Whalen, chief habitue, roused himself from a stupor on a tobacco barrel. Presently the customers, having indulged in the toddy, departed for the barbecue, the Captain went to the fort, and Mr. Crede and myself were left alone to talk over the business which had sent me to Philadelphia.|$|R
60|$|SCENE--Same as Act II. As {{the curtain}} rises, JAYSON is {{discovered}} {{sitting in an}} armchair by the fireplace, in which a log fire is burning fitfully. He is staring into the flames, a strained, expectant expression on his face. It is about {{three o'clock in the}} morning. There is no light but that furnished by the fire which fills the room with shifting shadows. The door in <b>the</b> rear is <b>opened</b> and RICHARD appears, his face harried by the stress of unusual emotion. Through <b>the</b> <b>opened</b> <b>doorway,</b> a low, muffled moan of anguish sounds from {{the upper part of the}} house. JAYSON and RICHARD both shudder. The latter closes the door behind him quickly as if anxious to shut out the noise.|$|R
6000|$|... [The humble-men go out. There is {{the sound}} of horses being [...] started, and the butt end of the van disappears. WELLWYN stays [...] on his stool, smoking and {{brooding}} over <b>the</b> fare. <b>The</b> <b>open</b> [...] <b>doorway</b> is darkened by a figure. CANON BERTLEY is standing [...] there.] ...|$|R
6000|$|And hastily {{gathering}} up {{the package of}} samples, the restaurant keeper walked to <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> and flung knives, forks and spoons into the muddy gutter! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How very dreadful--she's drunk!' said Lyon. He was {{painting}} hard, {{but he looked}} up, checking himself: Miss Geraldine, in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway,</b> had thrust back her head.|$|E
60|$|The blue woollen bonnet {{of the old}} hunter {{appeared}} through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway,</b> {{with the}} pipe under the branching gray moustache. The eyes of the men met.|$|E
5000|$|The central bay of a barn was {{the typical}} {{location}} of the threshing floor. Some large barns have two or even three threshing floors. The floors in barns may be packed dirt, stone, or a tightly fitted wood. To keep the grain from falling out <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doorway(s)</b> a board was sometimes placed across the doorway called a threshold, but the term threshold was originally the floor itself or well foot-worn floor boards. Threshing in barns was mostly done by hand with a flail until threshing machines became available in the 19th century. The harvest could be stored in the barn and threshed during the winter. Barns may have a granary room or a separate granary building {{may have been used}} to store the threshed crop.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not much}} like a cross to Johnnie's mind, being a sort of tower, all arches and pinnacles and mouldered statues, getting smaller up to the spiring top; but he knew it, and saw the hotel {{opposite}} with all its blinds down, nothing like astir yet, except that some one was about under <b>the</b> great <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> leading into a yard, half entrance, to the hotel.|$|R
60|$|The {{creature}} {{carried a}} wooden bowl which it filled with dried food from {{several of the}} vessels; then it turned and quit the room. Bradley could see through <b>the</b> partially <b>open</b> <b>doorway</b> that it descended the ladder. The girl {{told him that it}} was taking the food to the women and the young below, and that while it might return immediately, the chances were that it would remain for some time.|$|R
