5000|$|The Department of Justice, which supervises the New Bilibid Prison {{through its}} Bureau of Corrections, {{conducted}} more than 30 raids from 2014 to 2016 under then Justice Secretary Leila de Lima. Despite the raids {{which resulted in}} the <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of prison personnel, the transfer of several convicted drug dealers to the National Bureau of Investigation detention facility, the demolition of luxurious prison villas, and regular searches and seizures, illegal drug trade continued at the maximum security prison as the Secretary admitted in 2015. The issue of illegal drug operations at the Bilibid persisted throughout the remaining months of Aquino's term and even became a contentious election topic in 2016. During the 2nd presidential debate held in Cebu City in March 2016, Duterte called administration candidate and former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas a [...] "fraud" [...] and blasted the administration for [...] "allowing shabu to be cooked inside the national penitentiary." [...] De Lima, then running for senator, slammed Duterte's allegation and said there was no truth in the claims that drug trade flourished in the Bilibid during the Aquino administration.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to empirically {{test the}} client {{management}} intervention, <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of auditors, high audit fees, tight audit time budget, audit sanctions on over-time budget, {{the length of}} the audit relationship of auditor independence. Auditor independence has a very important role to the auditor when the audit task is to maintain an honest and impartial attitude to anyone. The population in this study is the auditor who worked on the KAP Semarang consisting of 18 KAP. The samples used by random sampling. Questionnaire distributed to respondents were 112 and the number of questionnaires that can be analyzed as many as 53. The data analysis technique used in this study is the technique of multiple regression analysis.

40|$|In the {{education}} industry, organizations must strive to optimize human and intellectual capital. Experience, knowledge, and teaching style {{can be part}} of the capital which needs to be organized {{in order to protect the}} “organizational memory”. Having students who have been selected discretely, and the addition of many courses offered at preparatory center, academic management is the critical unit or key assets that will assist in the organization of the academic memory. Academic memories most of the time will reside with the owner. If memories are not being managed accordingly, the memories become wasted to the institution. Therefore, a lot of wasted memories occur due to retired staff, contract <b>termination,</b> <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> or death. Hence, the aim of this study is to 1) identify the person in charge of memory for academic purposes, 2) identify memories of INTEC and 3) propose an appropriate organizational memory framework or model for INTEC. Finally this study will be beneficial to researchers and practitioner who are interested in applying OM in an academic institution...|$|E
40|$|This article {{extends the}} theory of {{government}} agency survival from separation of powers to parliamentary government systems. It evaluates expectations of increased risk to agencies following transitions in government, prime minister or departmental minister, and from incongruence between the originally establishing and currently overseeing political executive. Using survival models for UK executive agencies between 1989 and 2012, the study finds that politics trumps performance. Ministers seek to make their mark by terminating agencies created by previous ministers, which is reinforced by high media attention to the agency. Performance against agency targets is not associated with higher <b>termination</b> risk, <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> agencies do not perform any better than those that were terminated. Financial autonomy provides some protection for agencies that are less dependent on budgetary appropriations...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the grand}} {{challenges}} in agent technology research is quasi-automatic development of heterogeneous and dynamic multiagent systems using Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) tools. This paper presents an innovative approach to developing and supporting multiagent systems at run-time. Multiagent systems (MASs) {{can and should be}} generated dynamically based on high-level user specifications which are transformed into a mission. Dynamically generating agents could also be offered as a pervasive service. Heterogeneity of MASs refers to diverse functionality and constituency of the system which include mobile as well as host associated software agents. This paper proposes and demonstrates on-demand and just-in-time agent generation approach which is combined with run-time support for MASs. Run-time support is based on mission cost-efficiency and objectives which enable <b>termination,</b> generation, injection <b>and</b> <b>replacement</b> of software agents as the mission evolves. We present the formal underpinning of our approach and describe the prototype tool - called eHermes, which has been implemented using specific agent platforms. Lessons and results of testing eHermes are reported and analyzedUpprättat; 2006; 20080131 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|<b>Termination</b> <b>and</b> {{confluence}} {{properties of}} term rewriting systems are of fundamental importance, both from a theoretical {{point of view}} and also concerning many practical applications in computer science and mathematics. We study structural aspects of <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> confluence properties of unconditional and conditional term rewriting systems. Two types of structural aspects are considered. First we investigate single rewrite systems. In a systematic manner we analyze how restricted versions of <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> confluence relate to each other <b>and</b> to general <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> confluence. In particular we focus on innermost rewriting and its properties. Various structural syntactic and semantic conditions are isolated which guarantee equivalence of general <b>termination</b> (<b>and</b> confluence) and weakened versions of these properties. In a second major part we consider structural aspects of combining systems. Here we investigate modularity and preservation properties of rewrite systems under various types of combinations. We survey known results in a unifying framework and develop new approaches, in particular for ensuring the preservation of termination under variou...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} restricted <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> confluence {{properties of}} term rewritADing systems, in particular weak <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> innermost <b>termination,</b> <b>and</b> theirinterrelation. New criteria are provided which are {{sufficient for the}} equivalenceof innermost / weak <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> uniform <b>termination</b> of term rewriting sysADtems. These criteria provide interesting possibilities to infer completeness, i. e. termination plus confluence, from restricted <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> confluence properADties. Using these basic results we are also able to prove some new results aboutmodular termination of rewriting. In particular, we show that termination ismodular for some classes of innermost terminating and locally confluent termrewriting systems, namely for nonADoverlapping and even for overlay systems. Asan easy consequence this latter result also entails a simplified proof of the factthat completeness is a decomposable property of soADcalled constructor systems. Furthermore we show how to obtain similar results for even more general cases of(nonADdisjoint) combined systems with shared constructors and of certain hierarADchical combinations of systems with constructors. Interestingly, these modularityresults are obtained {{by means of a}} proof technique which itself constitutes a modADular approach...|$|R

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} {{model of the}} labor market with moral hazard, {{equilibrium}} layoff is modeled as termination of an optimal long-term contract. Termination, together with compensation (current and future), is used as an incentive device to induce worker efforts. I then use the model to study analytically the effects of a firing tax on <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> worker compensation and utility. There are three layers to the impact of a firing tax on layoff and worker utility. A higher firing tax could either reduce aggregate <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> increase worker utility, or increase aggregate <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> reduce worker utility, depending on the structure of the environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{well defined}} in {{bacterial}} systems, the molecular mechanisms underlying ribosome recycling in eukaryotic cells have {{only begun to}} be explored.

Here, using an in vitro reconstituted yeast translation system, we identify a key role for the multifunctional ABC-family protein Rli 1 in stimulating both eRF 1 -mediated <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> ribosome recycling in yeast. Through subsequent kinetic analysis, we uncover a network of regulatory features that provides mechanistic insight into how the events of <b>termination</b> <b>and</b> recycling are obligately ordered.
