5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's <b>treecreeper,</b> for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> differentiates it from bar-tailed <b>treecreeper,</b> which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from brown-throated <b>treecreeper.</b> Rusty-flanked <b>treecreeper</b> is more difficult to separate from Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> {{belongs to}} the {{northern}} group, along with the North American brown creeper, C. americana, the short-toed <b>treecreeper,</b> C. brachydactyla, of western Eurasia, and, if it is considered a separate species, Hodgson's <b>treecreeper,</b> C. hodgsoni, from the southern rim of the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> or common <b>treecreeper</b> (Certhia familiaris) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{also known}} in the British Isles, where {{it is the only}} living member of its genus, simply as <b>treecreeper.</b> It is similar to other treecreepers, and has a curved bill, patterned brown upperparts, whitish underparts, and long stiff tail feathers which help it creep up tree trunks. It can be most easily distinguished from the similar short-toed <b>treecreeper,</b> which shares much of its European range, by its different song.|$|E
50|$|The African spotted creeper has {{strongly}} spotted and barred plumage, clearly {{different from}} the <b>treecreepers</b> of the subfamily Certhiinae. It weighs up to 16 grams, {{twice as much as}} <b>treecreepers</b> of similar length (up to 15 cm).|$|R
40|$|The six {{species of}} Australian <b>treecreepers</b> {{constitute}} a fairly homogeneous group usually now considered {{to constitute a}} distinct family Climacteridae. The group has given considerable difficulty to taxonomists, who disagree on whether the <b>treecreepers</b> evolved within a general bark-foraging assemblage that includes the holarctic creepers (Certhia), nuthatches (Sitta) and sittellas (Daphoenositta), among others, or within an Australo-Papuan oscine radi-ation. The latter view, {{which appears to be}} gaining preva-lence, has been expounded by Sibley et al. (19841, who provide an excellent taxonomic history of the genus Cli-macteris. They provide evidence from DNA-DNA hybrid-isation that the <b>treecreepers</b> represent an ancient diversio...|$|R

5|$|The {{brown creeper}} has {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of Eurasian <b>treecreeper,</b> but has closer affinities to short-toed <b>treecreeper,</b> and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's <b>treecreeper</b> is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> {{overlaps}} with that of several other treecreepers, which can present local identification problems. In Europe, the Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> shares much of its range with the short-toed <b>treecreeper.</b> Compared to that species, it is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter supercilium and slightly shorter bill. Visual identification, even in the hand, may be impossible for poorly marked birds. A singing <b>treecreeper</b> is usually identifiable, since short-toed <b>treecreeper</b> has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding {{quite different from the}} song of Eurasian treecreeper; however, both species have been known to sing the other's song.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> is {{the most}} {{widespread}} member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed <b>treecreeper,</b> {{it tends to be}} found mainly in coniferous forest, especially spruce and fir. However, where it is the only <b>treecreeper,</b> as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E
50|$|As {{their name}} implies, <b>treecreepers</b> forage for insects {{and other small}} creatures living on and under the bark of trees, mostly eucalypts, though several species also hunt on the ground, through leaf-litter, and on fallen timber. Unlike the Holarctic <b>treecreepers</b> they do not use their tail for support when {{climbing}} tree trunks, only their feet.|$|R

50|$|The <b>treecreepers</b> are monogamous and territorial. Nests {{and eggs}} vary between the genera: the Certhia <b>treecreepers</b> usually nest in {{a gap between}} the tree bark and the tree, whereas the nest of the spotted creeper is placed in the fork of a branch. Incubation lasts 14 to 15 days, and young fledge after 15 to 16 days.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> {{has nine}} or more {{subspecies}} which breed {{in different parts}} of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed <b>treecreeper</b> in western Europe it {{is more likely to be}} found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> is {{non-migratory}} in the milder {{west and}} south of its breeding range, but some northern birds move south in winter, and individuals breeding on mountains may descend to a lower altitude in winter. Winter movements and post-breeding dispersal may lead to vagrancy outside the normal range. Wintering migrants of the Asian subspecies have been recorded in South Korea and China, and the nominate form has been recorded west of its breeding range as far as Orkney, Scotland. The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> has also occurred as a vagrant to the Channel Islands (where the short-toed is the resident species), Majorca and the Faroe Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> {{was first}} {{described}} under its current scientific name by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758. The binomial name {{is derived from}} Ancient Greek kerthios, a small tree-dwelling bird described by Aristotle and others, and Latin familiaris, familiar or common.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, the {{placement}} with the starlings requires confirmation. As notoriously confounded by convergent evolution as Philippine creeper anatomy is, the scenario of Zuccon et al. requires the underlying plesiomorphies closer to those present in starlings and thrashers than to those retained in <b>treecreepers</b> and wrens, {{and vice versa}} as regards synapomorphies. This has not been tested; in the meantime, it may {{be noted that the}} color pattern of Rhabdornis is more similar to that of some Aplonis - a member of the group of starlings supposedly most close to the Philippine creepers - than to that of <b>treecreepers.</b> Both Philippine and <b>treecreepers</b> are cryptic in adaptation to their tree-creeping lifestyle, but this is achieved with a very different camouflage pattern in either. Additionally, they are very distant even among starlings (Zuccon et al. 2006: 340) and may in the end be maintained as a family on their own. The Australian <b>treecreepers</b> (Climacteridae), meanwhile, are an entirely unrelated family of passerine birds which is actually close to bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchidae).|$|R
50|$|The Indian spotted creeper has {{grey and}} white spotted and barred plumage, clearly {{different}} from the <b>treecreepers</b> of the subfamily Certhiinae. It weighs up to 16 grams, {{twice as much as}} <b>treecreepers</b> of similar length (up to 15 cm). The Indian spotted creeper has a thin pointed down-curved bill, a bit longer than the head, that it uses to extricate insects from bark, but it lacks the stiff tail feathers which <b>treecreepers</b> use to prop themselves on the vertical surface of tree trunks. They have a whitish supercilium contrasting with a dark eye stripe and white on the throat. The wing is long and pointed with a highly reduced first primary feather. The tail has twelve feathers and is square tailed. The sexes are identical in plumage.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{most common}} urban birds, the heath holds {{breeding}} sparrowhawks and tawny owls {{as well as}} nuthatchs, <b>treecreepers</b> and great spotted woodpeckers.|$|R
5|$|The female Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> forages {{primarily}} on the upper parts of the tree trunks, while the male uses the lower parts. A study in Finland found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.|$|E
5|$|Several {{birds and}} other predatory organisms prey on the black-headed sugar ant. Birds {{such as the}} black-faced woodswallow, rufous <b>treecreeper,</b> noisy miner, jacky winter and {{southern}} scrub robin prey on this species, {{as indicated by the}} fact that workers body parts have been found in the birds' stomach contents. Other predators of the black-headed sugar ant include the rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up tree trunks like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies {{to the base of}} another tree with a {{distinctive}} erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian <b>treecreeper.</b> In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the {{introduced}} North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> {{typically}} seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Treecreepers</b> measure from 12 to 18 {{centimetres}} in length. Their {{bills are}} gently down-curved and rather long, used for probing bark for insects and spiders. They often climb up tree trunks in a helical path, hopping {{with their feet}} together; their toes are long and tipped with strongly curved claws for gripping. The longer tails of the Certhia <b>treecreepers</b> are stiffened {{to use as a}} prop while climbing, but those of the spotted creeper are shorter and not stiffened. Their songs and calls are thin and high-pitched.|$|R
40|$|Brood size of Eurasian <b>Treecreepers</b> Certhia familiaris was {{manipulated}} {{in three}} years that differed in food abundance in order to detect factors that limit clutch size. The Tree-creeper parents were able to successfully raise enlarged broods only in a year with good food availability, but even then, the nestlings were of lower body weight than in reduced broods. Among the enlarged broods, the lowest breeding success was observed in a year with the lowest food abundance. <b>Treecreepers</b> with enlarged broods depleted their food supply in a year with scarce food, but not when food was abundant, and changes in forag-ing behaviour were observed only when food was scarce. Females and males did not in-crease their provisioning rates with brood size, but {{the responses of the}} sexes differed be-tween years. Our results support Lack’s hypothesis of clutch-size regulation: when food was scarce, <b>Treecreepers</b> laid the maximal number of eggs {{that they were able to}} raise suc-cessfully to fledging. However, trade-offs between current and future reproduction may also be important in clutch size determination of this species. Food abundance and limited foraging time seem to play major roles in limiting the clutch size of <b>Treecreepers,</b> but the importance of these factors differs among years. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Indian spotted creeper (Salpornis spilonota) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird, {{which is}} a member of the subfamily Salpornithinae which is placed along with the <b>treecreepers</b> in the family Certhiidae. This small bird has a marbled black and white plumage that makes it difficult to spot as it forages on the trunks of dark, deeply fissured trees where it picks out insect prey using its curved bill. It is found in patchily distributed localities mainly in the dry scrub and open deciduous forests of northern and central peninsular India. It does not migrate. Their inclusion along with the <b>treecreepers</b> is not certain and some studies find them more closely related to the nuthatches while others suggest a close relation to the wallcreeper. They lack the stiff tail feathers of <b>treecreepers</b> and do not use their tail for supporting them while creeping vertically along tree trunks.|$|R
5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the <b>treecreeper,</b> and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian <b>treecreeper</b> is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|Predators of <b>treecreeper</b> nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and {{predation}} {{is about three}} times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E
