According to Nermark, the budget for creating this game was less than those of other triple-A video games; {{he also said that}} despite the poor commercial performance, the team was still proud of the final product.|$|E

Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E

In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled Kourtney and Khloé in Miami, which was later renamed Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new Dash boutique. Ted Harbert, president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. [...] "It's a very simple formula <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. [...] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' and we think that humor and warmth will carry over to Miami," [...] Harbert added. The show premiered on August 16, 2009 to very high ratings; the first episode brought in 2.7 million total viewers and then became the most-watched show on the network since The Anna Nicole Show in 2002. The spin-off was subsequently renewed for a second season which premiered on June 13, 2010, and later returned as Kourtney and Kim Take Miami for a third season on January 20, 2013. Additionally, a series of webisodes entitled Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord were released following the show, which showcased Disick as he informed viewers how to live like a [...] "king".|$|E

It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that.

Sylvester Stallone was also {{revealed to be}} in the film, with his role later revealed as Stakar Ogord. Gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film. On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill's father when he did, Gunn felt that since [...] "people were going to figure it out eventually… it was better <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> the reins in our own hands" [...] and make the reveal. Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to discov er who Quill's father is to [...] "the story and the relationship that these characters have". In August 2016, Gunn confirmed the film would feature a post-credits scene, later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and one post-credits. Gunn also planned a sixth scene, where the Ravager Gef is found [...] "mortally wounded" [...] on the ship, but [...] "it ended up being a little confusing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, the Supreme Court {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it had ordered the army to remove Zelaya from office. The Supreme Court stated [...] "The armed forces, in charge of supporting the constitution, acted to defend the state of law and {{have been forced to}} apply legal dispositions against those who have expressed themselves publicly and acted against the dispositions of the basic law". On 30 June, the military's chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza Membreño, showed a detention order, signed 26 June by a Supreme Court judge, which ordered the armed forces to detain the president, identified by his full name of José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, at his home in the Tres Caminos area of the capital. It cited him for treason and abuse of authority, among other charges. Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order: [...] "In the moment <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> him out of the country, in the way that he was taken out, there is a crime. Because of the circumstances of the moment this crime occurred, {{there is going to be}} a justification and cause for acquittal that will protect us." [...] He said the decision was taken by the military leadership [...] "in order to avoid bloodshed". He said [...] "What was more beneficial, remove this gentleman from Honduras or present him to prosecutors and have a mob assault and burn and destroy and for us to have to shoot?" [...] Colonel Inestroza also commented that Zelaya's allegiance to Hugo Chávez was hard to stomach and [...] "It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible. I personally would have retired, because my thinking, my principles, would not have allowed me to participate in that." ...|$|E
