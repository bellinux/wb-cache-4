5|$|By June 1992, {{approximately}} 800 {{people had}} been killed by <b>the</b> <b>bombardment.</b> By the end of the Croatian War of Independence in 1995, a total of 1,724 people from Osijek had been killed, including 1,327 soldiers and 397 civilians. The city itself suffered great damage during the war, with the bulk of direct damage occurring {{as a consequence of the}} 1991–92 bombardment. Direct war damage sustained by the city was estimated at a total of US$1.3billion. The damage was regularly recorded by 400 volunteers during <b>the</b> <b>bombardment.</b>|$|E
5|$|During its height, the {{intensity}} of <b>the</b> <b>bombardment</b> was reported to reach as high as one shell per minute, and the artillery attacks were compounded by Yugoslav Air Force strikes against the city. According to Croatian sources, a total of 6,000 artillery shells were fired against Osijek in the period. Prior {{to the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>bombardment,</b> the civilian population of Osijek totaled 104,761 city residents and 129,792 municipal residents. These numbers were significantly reduced as civilians fled the fighting. It is estimated that only {{about a third of the}} population remained in the city by the end of November, with some sources placing the estimate even lower, suggesting that the population of the city was reduced to just 10,000 civilians during the most intense periods of <b>the</b> <b>bombardment.</b> Those who remained in Osijek through the fighting generally slept in bomb shelters.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>bombardment</b> {{caused a}} large number of casualties.

5|$|SMS Árpád  was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} {{built by}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the early 20th century. She was launched on 11 September 1901 as the second of three s.

Due to a shortage of coal, she was soon decommissioned after <b>the</b> <b>bombardment</b> of Ancona and used as harbor defense ship {{for the remainder of}} the war. After the war, all of the Habsburg-class battleships were ceded to Great Britain as war prizes. She was scrapped in Italy in 1921.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>bombardment</b> of 19 February, Gaulois bombarded Turkish forts {{covering}} {{the mouth of}} the Dardanelles, although Charlemagne did not participate that day. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but was only lightly damaged.

On 2 March, the French squadron bombarded targets in the Gulf of Saros, {{at the base of the}} Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Turkish guns while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. Gaulois was hit by one shell during this attack that failed to detonate. Admiral Guépratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Turkish fortifications.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 15 December, {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet {{encountered}} British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.

Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool, while Von der Tann and Derfflinger went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. During <b>the</b> <b>bombardment</b> of Hartlepool, Moltke was struck by a 6in (15.2cm) shell from a coastal battery, which caused minor damage between decks, but no casualties. Blücher was hit six times and Seydlitz three times by the coastal battery. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that feldspathic granulitic impactites, which are characterized by a high model plagioclase content of between 70 and 80 %, all formed in the period after consolidation of the lunar crust and before <b>the</b> final <b>bombardment.</b> <b>The</b> granulitic impactites contain essentially no KREEP component, which suggests that KREEP appeared on the lunar surface mostly after {{the formation of the}} granulitic impactites, at about the start of <b>the</b> final <b>bombardment.</b> <b>The</b> granulite metamorphism indicated by the matrix textures of these samples requires 1000 C temperatures for prolonged periods of time.

5|$|For nine days, the British {{soldiers}} and sailors of the expeditionary force constructed gun batteries and trenches around the fort, bringing ashore large quantities of supplies and equipment in readiness for a lengthy siege. At 16:30 on 19 February the preparations were complete and <b>the</b> <b>bombardment</b> began, 14 heavy cannon and 28 mortars beginning a continuous attack on the fort which lasted {{for the next four}} days. French casualties in the overcrowded fort were severe, with 200 men killed or wounded. British casualties were minimal, with five killed and 11 wounded, principally in an explosion in an ammunition tent manned by sailors from HMS Amaranthe. At 12:00 on 23 February, Villaret de Joyeuse's trumpeter was sent to the British camp with a message proposing surrender terms. These were unacceptable to Beckwith and <b>the</b> <b>bombardment</b> resumed at 22:00, continuing until 09:00 the following morning when three white flags were raised over the fort and the French admiral surrendered unconditionally. <b>The</b> <b>bombardment</b> had cracked the roof of the fort's magazine, and there were fears that further shelling might have ignited the gunpowder and destroyed the building completely.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November at 6:42a.m., the Kaštela TG {{commenced}} a naval {{bombardment of}} targets in Split {{and on the}} islands of Brač and Šolta.

Besides several near-misses, the coastal artillery fire scored a direct hit against VPBR-31 Split, that was attributed to the Marinča Rat-based battery on Šolta.

5|$|On 23 May 1915, {{between two}} and four hours after news of the Italian {{declaration}} of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, Zrínyi {{and the rest of}} the fleet departed to bombard the Italian and Montenegrin coast. Their focus was on the important naval base at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro. <b>The</b> <b>bombardment</b> of Montenegro was part of the larger Austro-Hungarian campaign against the Kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia, who were members of the Entente, during the first half of 1915. The attack on Ancona was an immense success, and the ships were unopposed during the operation. <b>The</b> <b>bombardment</b> of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an Italian steamer in the port of Ancona itself, and an Italian destroyer, , was severely damaged further south. On the shore, the infrastructure of the port of Ancona, as well as the surrounding towns, were severely damaged. The railroad yard in Ancona, as well as the port facilities in the town, were damaged or destroyed. The local shore batteries were also suppressed. During <b>the</b> <b>bombardment,</b> Zrínyi also helped to destroy a train, a railway station, and a bridge at Senigallia. Additional targets that were damaged or destroyed included wharves, warehouses, oil tanks, radio stations, and the local barracks. Sixty-three Italians, both civilians and military personnel, were killed in <b>the</b> <b>bombardment.</b> By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E
