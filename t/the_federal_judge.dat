Another scheduled meeting with the creditors had been missed after Suge said he had experienced a death in his family.

25|$|Just days later, {{the case}} against Presser took an {{unexpected}} twist as <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>judge</b> assigned to Presser's trial was disqualified from the case. U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aldrich {{was removed from the}} case after Presser's attorneys accused her of bias. After a hearing which lasted only a few hours, Aldrich was removed from the case—a change which is exceedingly rare in U.S. courts. The trial was handed over to U.S. District Judge John Manos.|$|E
25|$|On {{appeal to}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the appeals court {{disagreed}} with <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>judge</b> {{and found that it}} was not enough for Willman to act with the intent to assist the government. There needed to have been some degree of governmental knowledge and acquiescence in Willman's actions to find that Willman was acting as a government agent. Thus, the appeals court reversed the district court's order suppressing the evidence that was found as the fruit of Willman's illegal, but private, search. In March 2005, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case, which ended Kline's appeals.|$|E
25|$|The votes {{challenged}} by Miller's team {{were put in}} separate boxes, leaving it to the lawsuit {{to decide whether they}} would be counted for Murkowski. On November 11, the Miller campaign alleged it had received reports of voter intimidation and fraud {{and that it would be}} filing a lawsuit in Alaska state court asking for voters rolls for certain precincts to determine whether the precincts had counted more ballots than there were registered voters. Miller told Fox News Channel on November 18 that his campaign may request a recount, investigate the voting machines, and look into whether the absentee ballots for the military were mailed in a timely fashion. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>judge</b> held the suit could be decided by reference to State law, and directed Miller to file in State court, which he did on November 22, stopping the certification of election results and possibly delaying the seating of a second Senator for Alaska at the beginning of the new term in January.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} impacts To Kill a Mockingbird has had is Atticus Finch's model of integrity for the legal profession. As scholar Alice Petry explains, [...] "Atticus {{has become something of a}} folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person." [...] Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>judge</b> who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence. One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was To Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in the Michigan Law Review claims, [...] "No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession," [...] before questioning whether [...] "Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun".|$|E
500|$|Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were extradited from Britain in 1994, {{and were}} convicted {{by a jury}} {{decision}} on July 28, 1995, for their roles in the assassination plot. They had unsuccessfully attempted to appeal their extradition from Britain to Home Secretary Michael Howard. During their trial the prosecution presented twenty-nine witnesses, including former followers of Rajneesh who placed both women in planning meetings where they discussed murdering Turner. David Berry Knapp, {{the former mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, testified for the government in the case and implicated Croft and Hagan in the assassination conspiracy. Ava Kay Avalos (Ma Ava), a Rajneesh disciple, testified in the Croft case and stated that she {{had been part of the}} conspirators that plotted to assassinate Turner. In addition to Knapp and Avalos, co-conspirators Richard Kevin Langford, Phyllis Caldwell, and Alma Peralta testified in the case pursuant to conditional plea or immunity agreements. Both women were sentenced to five years in prison. Croft and Hagan did not testify during their trial. [...] "We hashed over everything – evidence, notes, evidence, notes. I think we did an absolutely fabulous job," [...] said one of the jurors. At the sentencing for Croft and Hagan, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>Judge</b> Malcolm Marsh described them as [...] "people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system." [...] Prosecutor Tim Reardon called the conspiracy to commit assassination [...] "a deadly serious crime aimed at the heart of the criminal justice system." [...] Croft and Hagan were released from imprisonment at FCI Dublin, California, in April 1998, and returned to Britain.|$|E

500|$|Years later, after {{consulting}} with another lawyer, Selletti made another attempt at suing Carey and Sony. His lawyer, Jeffrey Levitt, had uncovered {{the fact that}} the film was released in October 1992, a full six weeks prior to the November 22 dating in Carey's notebook. Additionally, [...] "Heart of a Hero", which was written by Luther Vandross for the film, was submitted in January 1992, making it impossible for [...] "Hero" [...] to have been the original choice of song for the soundtrack. After uncovering further tapes from the studio dating to the summer of 1992, recordings provided evidence that Carey and Afansieff had indeed discussed and had parts of the song completed well before the film's October release. Following the evidence from both parties, the judge dismissed the case, ruling in Carey's favor for the second time. Following the dismissal of the case, Rhonda Dimmie, another songwriter and an independent singer, filed a lawsuit against Carey, this time claiming the song to have borrowed heavily from her song [...] "Be Your Own Hero". During the short deposition made by Carey, Afanasieff revealed that they had written the song in two days during the summer of 1992, [...] "within a matter of hours." [...] Soon after, the case was dismissed, with the judge claiming there to not be sufficient evidence on Dimmie's behalf. Following the lawsuits, in 2001 Selletti made further hints to plan another lawsuit, as well as a forensic team of specialists to conduct research on the incident. Following the suits, Cindy Berger, Carey's publicist released the following statement: [...] "This case has been thrown out of court three times. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>judge</b> after hearing Selletti's story and considering all the evidence ruled the case was a 'complete fabrication' and that it was filed 'to extort a settlement from deep-pocket defendants." ...|$|E
