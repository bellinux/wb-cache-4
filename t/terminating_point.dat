60|$|The infernal regions, {{according}} to Dante, are situate in the globe we inhabit, directly beneath Jerusalem, and {{consist of a}} succession of gulfs or circles, narrowing as they descend, and terminating in the centre; so that the general shape {{is that of a}} funnel. Commentators have differed as to their magnitude; but the latest calculation gives 315 miles for the diameter of the mouth or crater, and {{a quarter of a mile}} for that of its <b>terminating</b> <b>point.</b> In the middle is the abyss, pervading the whole depth, and 245 miles in diameter at the opening; which reduces the different platforms, or territories that surround it, to a size comparatively small. These territories are more or less varied with land and water, lakes, precipices, &c. A precipice, fourteen miles high, divides the first of them from the second. The passages from the upper world to the entrance are various; and the descents from one circle to another are effected by the poet and his guide in different manners-sometimes on foot through by-ways, sometimes by the conveyance of supernatural beings. The crater he finds to be the abode of those who have done neither good nor evil, caring for nothing but themselves. In the first circle are the whole unbaptised world--heathens and infants--melancholy, though not tormented. Here also is found the Elysium of Virgil, whose Charon and other infernal beings are among the agents of torment. In the second circle the torments commence with the sin of incontinence; and the punishment goes deepening with the crime from circle to circle, through gluttony, avarice, prodigality, wrath, sullenness, or unwillingness to be pleased with the creation, disbelief in God and the soul (with which the punishment by fire commences), usury, murder, suicide, blasphemy, seduction and other carnal enormities, adulation, simony, soothsaying, astrology, witchcraft, trafficking with the public interest, hypocrisy, highway robbery (on the great Italian scale), sacrilege, evil counsel, disturbance of the Church, heresy, false apostleship, alchemy, forgery, coining (all these, from seduction downwards, in one circle); then, in the frozen or lowest circle of all, treachery; and at the bottom of this is Satan, stuck into the centre of the earth.|$|E

50|$|The ancient Greeks used aqueducts and gravity-powered fountains to {{distribute}} water. According to ancient historians, fountains existed in Athens, Corinth, and other ancient Greek {{cities in the}} 6th century BC as the <b>terminating</b> <b>points</b> of aqueducts which brought water from springs and rivers into the cities. In the 6th century BC, the Athenian ruler Peisistratos built the main fountain of Athens, the Enneacrounos, in the Agora, or main square.

40|$|Monitoring the {{behavior}} and activities of people in Video surveillance has gained more applications in Computer vision. This paper proposes {{a new approach to}} model the human body in 2 D view for the activity analysis using Thinning algorithm. The first step of this work is Background subtraction which is achieved by the frame differencing algorithm. Thinning algorithm has been used to find the skeleton of the human body. After thinning, the thirteen feature <b>points</b> like <b>terminating</b> <b>points,</b> intersecting points, shoulder, elbow, and knee points have been extracted. Here, this research work attempts to represent the body model in three different ways such as Stick figure model, Patch model and Rectangle body model. The activities of humans have been analyzed with the help of 2 D model for the pre-defined poses from the monocular video data. Finally, the time consumption and efficiency of our proposed algorithm have been evaluated...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{capacity}} {{constraints on the}} North London Line the service only ran infrequently with uneven headways.

Another drawback with the service was the varied stopping patterns employed; for example trains only stopped at Camden Road on weekends, Brentford calls were only made from May 2001 and then only during the morning and evening on weekdays and all-day Sundays, and Romford only received one service per day in the early morning.|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} time new {{intercity}} railways were being promoted and suddenly the coal railways disadvantages seemed dominant. Their near monopoly of mineral traffic in very small areas now seemed to exclude them from areas where new business was being developed, emphasised by the <b>terminating</b> <b>points</b> at canal basins, requiring transshipment to get to destination. Their primitive track on stone block sleepers, their distinct track gauge of 4 ft 6 in also necessitated transshipment where they connected with the new standard gauge lines. Their obsolete locomotives, horse haulage by independent hauliers is some parts, the rope-worked inclines and the antiquated operating methods were all considerable disadvantages.|$|R

40|$|In {{his article}} "Indefinite <b>Terminating</b> <b>Points</b> and the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma", John Carroll asserts {{that there are}} "only {{uncooperative}} equilibria in finitely, but infinitely, iterated games, " and that this "calls into question {{the significance of the}} existence of cooperative equilibria in infinitely iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games. "i It is the purpose of this note to show that the claim is overstated for two reasons: (1) the iterated games he refers to are equivalent to finitely and definitely iterated games, of which {{it is well known that}} there are only uncooperative equilibria; and (2) his notion of an indefinitely iterated game is without any philosophical interest beyond that of the definitely iterated game. The problem centers around Carroll's notion of an indefinite iteration, which he characterizes using what he calls a 'terminating p-function', defined as follows. p is a terminating p-function if and only if (1) p(t) = 1, an...|$|R
