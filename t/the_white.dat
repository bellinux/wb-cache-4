5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E

In discovering {{the process and the}} causes of Jimmy?s and Ruby?s mimicry and ambivalence, cultural approach is applied in this analysis. Homi K. Bhabha?s postcolonialism theory, which is mimicry, is used to reveal the answers to her statement of the problem. Jimmy and Ruby have to mimic <b>the</b> <b>Whites,</b> yet they also feel the hatred that enables them to reject <b>the</b> <b>Whites?</b> culture. Therefore, both of them experience ambivalence toward <b>the</b> <b>Whites.</b> Moreover, poor and powerless conditions are actually the causes of Jimmy?s and Ruby?s mimicry and ambivalence. Surprisingly, the root of the poor and powerless conditions is <b>the</b> <b>Whites.</b> Thus, at <b>the</b> end of this analysis, the writer of this thesis can conclude that mimicry and ambivalence are done by Jimmy Munday and Ruby...|$|R

Everyone-quite rightly-lived in terror of everyone else...Haiti was hell, but Haiti was rich". Many of these conflicts involved slaves who had escaped the plantations. Many runaway slaves—called Maroons—hid {{on the margins of}} large plantations, living off the land and what they could steal from their former masters. Others fled to towns, to blend in with urban slaves and freed slaves who often concentrated in those areas. If caught, these runaway slaves would be severely and violently punished.
