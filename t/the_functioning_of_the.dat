In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.|$|E

In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on current issues and in relation with parliamentary works.|$|E

In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E

5|$|The Conservative Party had {{previously}} experienced serious division during the 1850s, when the Emperor's complete {{support for the}} Conciliation policy {{gave rise to the}} Progressives. The difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed Conciliation (led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí) perceived the Emperor as being indispensable to <b>the</b> <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political system: an ultimate and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened. This new generation of ultraconservatives, unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of PedroII's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. Unbeknownst to Rio Branco and PedroII, both had prepared the path to the Empire's later downfall.|$|E

The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.|$|E

Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of}} the horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
