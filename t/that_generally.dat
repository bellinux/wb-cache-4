5|$|Transits of Venus {{are among}} the rarest of {{predictable}} astronomical phenomena. They occur in a pattern <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years. The periodicity {{is a reflection of}} the fact that the orbital periods of Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Characters can use items {{ranging from}} {{projectiles}} to melee weapons; {{each has a}} different effect on the characters around it. Although many items have returned from previous Super Smash Bros. games, new ones have been introduced as well. Some returning items have changed appearance and function. Two varieties of items, Assist Trophies and Poké Balls, temporarily summon guest characters and Pokémon, respectively, <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> aid the summoner. They cannot be controlled by players and are usually invincible.|$|E

5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|Japanese tempura is {{a popular}} deep-fried food <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> {{consists}} of battered and fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Like Eliurus, Voalavo has {{moderately}} high-crowned (hypsodont) molars with crowns that consist not {{of discrete}} cusps, but of transverse laminae (plates) <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> lack longitudinal connections. However, Eliurus molars are slightly more hypsodont {{than those of}} Voalavo. The third upper and lower molars are smaller relative to the second molars in Voalavo than in Eliurus. Perhaps as a consequence, the upper third molar lacks discrete laminae in Voalavo, and the lower third molar has only two laminae (three in Eliurus). There are three roots under each upper molar and two under each lower.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by BioWare {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios and Electronic Arts. Originally released for the Xbox 360 video game console in 2007, {{it is the first}} game of the Mass Effect series. The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy in the year 2183, where civilization is threatened by a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships. The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must stop a rogue agent from carrying out the machine race's galactic invasion. The gameplay requires the player to complete multiple quests <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> involve space exploration, squad and vehicular combat, and interaction with non-player characters.|$|E
5|$|Mysts effects {{extended}} {{to those who}} played the games and technology. The title was widely credited {{as one of the}} first games to appeal not just to hardcore gamers but to casual players and demographics <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> did not play games, such as women. Mysts lack of conventional game elementsviolence, dying, and failureappealed to nongamers and those contemplating buying a computer. The Millers' decision to develop Myst for the nascent CD-ROM format helped boost interest and adoption of disc drives.|$|E

5|$|The Government of Singapore {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to mean the Executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. Although the President acts in her {{personal}} discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} line {{of research}} that culminated in Astronomia nova (A New Astronomy)—including the first two laws of planetary motion—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an equant (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was {{not satisfied with the}} complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held <b>that,</b> <b>generally,</b> detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E

5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The spectator attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was the best he had seen at any paraplegic sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility of the athletes with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> the standard of performance was below that of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M. Bazeley, Lynne Gilchrist and R. Scott who broke records in their events. A film of the Games was made.|$|E
5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Among the key {{indicators}} of Christianisation are long-cist cemeteries <b>that</b> <b>generally</b> indicate Christian burials {{due to their}} East-West orientation, although this correlation has been challenged by recent research. These burials are found {{between the end of}} the Roman era and the 7th century, after which point they become rarer. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the Tay, in Angus, the Mearns, Lothian and the Borders. It is generally accepted among scholars that place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period, most of which are located in the south-west, south and east. About a dozen inscribed stones of the 5th and 6th centuries, beginning with the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to c. 450, indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland.|$|E
