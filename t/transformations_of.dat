They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

So to perform cut-paste operation, first the substring ‘s’ get deleted from p by operation delete(s, p) and then ‘s’ get inserted at position q by operation insert(s, q). Here, delete(s, p) and insert(s, q) are independent operations. At all sharing sites, transformation functions corresponding to both delete(p, s) and insert(q, s) get called which results in increase in the time complexity.|$|R

5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – There is only scarce {{research}} about the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> e-HRM in general, {{and of the}} e-recruiting function in particular. Further, {{there is not much}} known of the transformational implications for the related people, process, and information technology (IT). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – To analyze the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> e-recruiting caused by external influences outside of the organization, the authors report the results of an eight-year case with a media corporation in order to derive and describe five consecutive steps <b>of</b> an e-recruiting <b>transformation</b> model. Findings – The paper comes up with five stages (<b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> tools, <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> systems, <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> workflows, <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> tasks, and <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> communication), each influenced by external developments and market tendencies (War for Talent, increasing number of applications, job market switch, globalization of job market, changing communication behavior). Research limitations/implications – This research contributes to literature by explaining the drivers <b>of</b> an e-HRM <b>transformation</b> and the different stages <b>of</b> this <b>transformation</b> process differentiated by the affected people, processes, and IT. However, it only observes the transformation in one company, hence the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> further e-HRM functions in other companies might differ. Practical implications – The paper highlights both the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> e-recruiting and for the related people, processes, and IT, so companies could observe their current status <b>of</b> e-recruiting <b>transformation.</b> Originality/value – This paper represents the first longitudinal approach observing the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> e-recruiting by describing different stages and external influences...|$|R

Individuals view others 2 ̆ 7 appearances according to their worldview which is influenced by beliefs and values. The rationale was that students enter college with preconceived stereotypes of individuals with diverse appearances according to their worldview, a worldview of diversity which frequently decreases their openness to individuals perceived as different.;The reflective writing responses of 17 students were analyzed using the Ground theory method. The responses were for initial reaction at the beginning and end of the course to pictures of students with diverse appearances. Students also completed reflective writings in six assignments: Pictorial Collage, Prepicture Responses, Culture Project, Trying on a New Identity Project, <b>Transformation</b> <b>of</b> Self Paper, and Postpicture Responses.;The overall influence of the course was assessed by changes in students 2 ̆ 7 self-examination and worldviews. Student 2 ̆ 7 s stage of self-examination was categorized according to the seven stages of the reflective judgment model (King 2 ̆ 6 Kitchener, 1994). All students had a change in self-examination as a result of the course. Stages of worldview of diversity developed by the researcher were used to classify students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes. Sixteen of the 17 students had a change in attitude. Further in-depth analysis <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> self was conducted and the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> self model was developed.;The <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> self model is a conceptual model of the two components required for <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> self.
