They were issued as perforated 8-card strips, sealed with tape (and the <b>tape</b> <b>seal</b> cannot be removed without damaging the cards). The {{back of the}} cards describe OnStar's services {{as well as providing}} contact information. They also give a brief history of Batman from his debut in 1939 through his adding new OnStar tools to the Batmobile in the year 2002.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{just prior}} to their buyout by Seagate, Conner Peripherals started using a {{cost-saving}} measure on its low-end drives. Instead of bolted-down, cast aluminum lids with rubber gaskets, Conner Peripherals {{came up with a}} design that used a thinner stamped aluminum lid, and a thick adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>seal</b> along the perimeter of the lid, where the lip of the lid meets the base casting. This design used no screws to hold on the lid [...] - [...] just cutting the tape could permanently damage the drive by making the lid come off. This design was kept well after the Seagate buyout, and was discontinued in 1999.|$|E

Afterwards, as he sleeps, she attempts to return the favour; finding no plug, she cuts him with scissors, and attempts to stem the blood flow with adhesive tape. Junichi dies and she leaves his body with the garbage. Heartbroken, she removes the <b>tape</b> <b>sealing</b> her own wound and allows herself to slowly deflate, to be collected with the garbage.|$|R
5000|$|Familiarity {{with the}} Teflon brand of {{fluoropolymers}} {{has led to}} the practice of erroneously referring to PTFE-based thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> as [...] "Teflon tape".

5000|$|At {{construction}} stage, the airtightness {{of individual}} components {{depends on the}} design (rectangular or round ducts, pressed or segmented bends, etc.) and assembly (seam type and welding quality). Components with factory-fitted sealing devices (e.g., gaskets, clips) meant to ease and accelerate the installation process are widely used in Scandinavian countries. A variety of techniques are widely used to tighten duct systems on site, including gaskets, <b>tapes,</b> <b>sealing</b> compound (mastic), internal duct lining, aerosol duct sealing. So-called [...] "duct tapes" [...] are often not suited for sealing ducts, which explains why, in the US, the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) requires any tape used on duct board or flexible ducts to be labeled in accordance with UL 181A or 181B.|$|R

5000|$|Thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> (also {{known as}} PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in <b>tape</b> form. Thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|R

These color-codes for thread <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> were introduced by Bill Bentley of Unasco Pty Ltd in the 1970s. In the UK, tape is used from coloured reels, e.g. yellow reels for gas, green for potable water.|$|R

40|$|Expedient {{sheltering}} {{involves the}} use of common materials to enhance the safety of a room inside a building against the impacts of a chemical plume. The central premise behind <b>taping</b> and <b>sealing</b> with duct <b>tape</b> and plastic is to reduce airflow into a room. This paper reviews issues {{associated with the use of}} expedient sheltering materials and the effectiveness of this strategy. Expedient sheltering provides additional protection to people sheltering in place beyond that provided by the house and by a safe room without expedient measures. The materials chosen for <b>taping</b> and <b>sealing</b> [...] duct <b>tape</b> and plastic [...] are appropriate because they effectively reduce infiltration and the materials should withstand a vapor challenge. Taping is essential to reduce air infiltration. Plastic sheeting is not a critical element for reducing air infiltration, but it makes sealing off large windows easier...|$|R
40|$|This Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) study, {{conducted}} {{under the}} auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy's Building America Industrialized Housing Partnership (BAIHP), compares mastic sealed duct systems to <b>tape</b> <b>sealed</b> systems by showing measured total duct leakage (CFM 25 TOTAL and QnTOTAL) and/or measured leakage to the outside (CFM 25 OUT and QnOUT) in 190 manufactured home floors or home sections. All manufacturers were considering or actively working toward achieving duct leakage below 3 % of the conditioned floor area (QnOUT= 0. 03), consistent with Energy Star Manufactured Homes criteria. Previous field tests suggest that CFM 25 OUT accounts for about half of CFM 25 TOTAL. These data show that achieving CFM 25 TOTAL= 6 % during production was generally correlated with achieving CFM 25 OUT= 3 % in mastic sealed systems, but less reliably with taped systems. Cost for achieving duct tightness goals range from $ 4 to $ 8 including duct testing on the assembly lin...|$|R
50|$|The largest {{construction}} or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades, made of either die-cast metal or molded plastic. Some use standard razor blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades. The user can adjust {{how far the}} blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife {{can be used to}} cut the <b>tape</b> <b>sealing</b> a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. Spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle. Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray. The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.|$|R

40|$|Duct leakage is a {{major source}} of energy loss in {{residential}} buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums, or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections, a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical <b>sealing</b> methods include <b>tapes</b> or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations of duct systems have shown that <b>taped</b> <b>seals</b> tend to fail over extended periods of time. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been testing sealant longevity for several years. The accelerated test method developed by LBNL is being used as a basis for an ASTM Standard under sub-committee E 6. 41. LBNL tests found that typical duct tape (i. e., fabric backed tapes with rubber adhesives) fails more rapidly than all other duct sealants. LBNL has also tested advanced tape products being developed by major manufacturers. The results of these tests showed that the major weaknesses of the tapes that fail are the use of natural rubber adhesives and the mechanical properties of the backing...|$|R
