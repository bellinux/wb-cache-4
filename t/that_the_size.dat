5|$|Debate has {{occurred}} regarding whether the sea mink was its own species, or a subspecies of the American mink. Those {{who argue that}} the sea mink was a subspecies often {{refer to it as}} Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> range for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.|$|E

Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket-equipped infantry (the streltsy), the Russians looked to foreign officers to update the equipment and training of their troops based on the Western European model of regulars, dragoons, and reiters. Eight such regiments, totaling 14,000 to 17,000 men, comprised part of Shein's army.|$|E

5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E

5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} has revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> distributions {{of the hot}} classical and cold classical objects have differing slopes.

The slope for the cold objects is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a change in slope at 140 km. The size distributions of the scattering objects, the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp {{decrease in the number}} of objects below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized to be due to either the collisional evolution of the population, or to be due to the population having formed with no objects below this size, with the smaller objects being fragments of the original objects.|$|E

5|$|The Australian military's {{role in the}} South-West Pacific {{decreased}} during 1944 as US forces {{took over}} responsibility for the main Allied effort in the region. In {{the latter half of}} 1943 the Australian Government decided, with MacArthur's agreement, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the military would be decreased to release manpower for war-related industries which were important to supplying Britain and US forces in the Pacific.

As a result of this policy, the size of the Army was reduced from late 1943 onwards, though an offensive force of six infantry divisions (three AIF and three Militia divisions) was maintained {{until the end of the}} war.

5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators.

5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} men present at the battle is disputed. A major factor in this {{is the fact that}} no primary sources give the {{number of men}} present at the battle, which leaves modern historians to {{estimate}} the number of men. Historian Leo de Hartog gives the size of the Rus' army as 30,000, while Richard Gabriel and Hector Hugh Munro claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the Rus' army was 80,000.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 120* Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 81. de Hartog also estimates the size of the Mongol army as 20,000, while Gabriel estimates that it was around 23,000 men.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, p. 118. However, historian John Fennell, an expert on Kievan Rus and early Russian history, and one well-versed in the primary sources, calls many of these figures into doubt, saying the numbers given in the Russian sources (there are no Mongol or Polovtsian sources, at least none that have survived, and other sources from other cultures, if they exist, are rather dubious) are formulaic or exaggerated and the chronicles contradict themselves. The information given in the Novgorod First Chronicle and the Primary Chronicle would imply a total of 11,000 soldiers for the Rus' forces, but Fennel considers even these numbers to be exaggerations. While Russian historians in the Soviet era have traditionally given estimates of around 80,000-100,000, modern Russian historians have taken a revisionist stance with a consensus settling on drastically lower numbers, with the Mongols having a numerical advantage. Russian historian D.G. Khrustalev estimated in 2013 that the Rus' army consisted of 10,000 soldiers (including mercenaries), while the Cumans brought 5,000 cavalry, for a total of 15,000.Khrustalev, p. 416 Carl Sverdrup estimates the army at 8,000, and says 30,000 and 80,000 are enormous exaggerations. The Mongols evidently believed it was a considerable force, given the extreme lengths the Mongols went to dislocate its formations.|$|E
