5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{involved}} in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related diseases are the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder α-Antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the most}} common hereditary diseases.|$|E
5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E

5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} {{functional}} elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E

25|$|Journey to Jerusalem: After {{the death}} of the Baptist, about half way through the gospels (approximately Matthew 17 and Mark 9) two key events take place <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> nature of the {{narrative}} by beginning the gradual revelation of his identity to his disciples: his proclamation as Christ by Peter and his transfiguration.

As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem through Perea he returns to the area where he was baptized.|$|E
25|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of layers}} of gas atoms (such as oxygen) onto the emitter surface, {{or part of}} it, can create surface electric dipoles <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> local work function {{of this part of}} the surface. This affects the FEM image; also, the change of work-function can be measured using a Fowler-Nordheim plot (see below). Thus, the FEM became an early observational tool of surface science. For example, in the 1960s, FEM results contributed significantly to discussions on heterogeneous catalysis. FEM has also been used for studies of surface-atom diffusion. However, FEM has now been almost completely superseded by newer surface-science techniques.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{isozymes}} may {{be almost}} identical in function, they may differ in other ways. In particular, amino acid substitutions <b>that</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> electric {{charge of the}} enzyme (such as replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid) are simple to identify by gel electrophoresis, and this forms {{the basis for the}} use of isozymes as molecular markers. To identify isozymes, a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer, and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by gel electrophoresis. Historically, this has usually been done using gels made from potato starch, but acrylamide gels provide better resolution.|$|E
