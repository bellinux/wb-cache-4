25|$|The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) {{performed}} an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl. Thus, {{all types of}} oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders {{were expected to be}} consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil.|$|E
500|$|One {{week before}} Lathrop's death, he {{negotiated}} {{the sale of}} the News-Miner to Charles Willis [...] "Bill" [...] Snedden. Snedden was an efficiency expert and former printer who had been employed by Henry Kaiser during WWII. After the war, he began troubleshooting newspapers. Through 1949 and 1950, Snedden did an efficiency study of the News-Miner and recommended about $100,000 in upgrades. Lathrop was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> much on the newspaper, and Snedded suggested that if Lathrop was unwilling to upgrade, Snedden would be interested in purchasing the paper. The two men worked out a verbal agreement before Lathrop was killed in a coal train accident.|$|E
500|$|The free-associative [...] "Champion" [...] is {{primarily}} composed of motivational lyrics, but West also briefly {{touches on the}} strained relationship he had with his father–who divorced from his mother {{when he was just}} three-years-old–eventually reaching the conclusion that even with their ups and downs, in the end, his father was a champion in his eyes. West described [...] "Stronger" [...] as an [...] "emancipation", as he uses the song to vent his frustration over mistakes he has made in the past. He describes his tribulation's with music critics and media causing his return as a [...] "Stronger" [...] rapper, as the song title implies. [...] "I Wonder" [...] carries an introspective tone, retaining a chorus about finding one's dreams, while West uses the verses to describe the struggle a person experiences in determining the meaning behind their life and achieving those dreams. Inspired by watching Bono open stadium tours, West concentrated on speaking volumes without using too many words on the song and delivers his raps in an exuberant, staccato manner. Using the same vocal stylings, [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] tells the operatic narrative of man contemplating the complexities of a tragic relationship. [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothing" [...] serves as West's reflection on his fame and is characterized by bitter remorse and defiant self-awareness. West begins the song by expounding his conflicted feelings regarding wealth and desire, describing a compulsion <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> overwhelms any and all other objectives in life. He ties this into his perceived overall inability to keep himself together even as he grows into an increasingly prominent figure in the public eye.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Abbott brothers, {{frontman}} Phil Anselmo began behaving strangely and distanced {{himself from}} the band {{when they returned to}} the road in 1995. The rest of the band members first thought that Pantera's perception of his fame had gotten to Anselmo, but Anselmo cited back pain from years of intense performances as the reason for his erratic behavior. Anselmo attempted to subdue his pain through alcohol, but this, as he admits, was affecting his performances and [...] "putting some worry into the band." [...] Doctors predicted that with surgery, Anselmo's back problem could be corrected, but that the recovery time could be a year or more. Not wanting <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>that</b> much time away from the band, Anselmo refused, and began using heroin as a painkiller.|$|E
