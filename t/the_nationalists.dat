5|$|A {{division}} {{developed between}} the uprising's communist leadership and <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> participating. <b>The</b> <b>nationalists</b> recognised the uprising had been crushed {{and wanted to}} stop fighting, while the Partisans were determined to continue the struggle. In late 1941, <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> contacted the Italians and offered to help them fight the communists, who had since been renamed Partisans. The nationalistsincluding Đurišić, who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegrosubsequently withdrew into the hinterland. They sought to avoid provoking the Italians and protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. In northern Montenegro, there was a marked distinction between the communists and nationalists. <b>The</b> <b>nationalists</b> had closer ties with Serbia and possessed a frontier mentality towards Muslims. The communists wished to continue the uprising by turning against their class enemies. Ustaše manipulation of the Muslims in the Sandžak and the expulsion of Serbs from areas annexed by Albania made Đurišić and his Chetniks impatient to continue fighting the Italians. They subsequently turned on the Muslims and Albanians in the region. The uprising continued with reduced intensity until December 1941. In 1941, Đurišić was awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović.|$|E

5|$|The Nationalist and Popular armies also {{designed}} and manufactured {{a number of}} their own tanks. <b>The</b> <b>Nationalists,</b> for example, began the war with three Trubia A4 prototypes, manufactured {{before the beginning of}} the conflict. They also completed the first prototype of the Verdeja light tank. This was designed to overcome the shortcomings of tanks provided by the Germans and the Italians, as well as Soviet tanks captured from the Popular Front. Popular Front production of armored vehicles was segmented throughout different areas of Spain. In the north, between 15 and 20 Carro Trubia-Naval tanks were manufactured at the factory in Sestao, conversely the Trubia factory had built only a single model Landesa tank. In Catalonia, two tanks were produced by the Maquinaría Moderna factory in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia. Though the Popular Front designed and manufactured many more armored fighting vehicles than <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists,</b> this ultimately worked in <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> favor as the factories and their production lines were captured intact during the war.|$|E

The 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 82nd Division was originally organized as the 2nd Cavalry Division during the Second Sino-Japanese War {{to be sent to}} central China to fight the Japanese invaders, but they were sent in Shaanxi by Hu Zongnan to blockade communist base. After the end of World War II, <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> 2nd Cavalry Division returned to Qinghai, along with nationalist 8th Cavalry Division returning from Xuzhou. <b>The</b> <b>nationalist</b> 2nd Cavalry Division was subsequently reorganized as 2nd Regiment of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, and in May 1947, the unit was selected to reinforce the besieged town of Heshui. <b>The</b> <b>nationalist</b> commander of <b>the</b> campaign, Ma Jiyuan, the commander of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 82nd Division selected his uncle, Ma Bufang’s brother-in-law, Lieutenant General Ma Quanyi, the deputy commander of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 82nd Division {{to be in charge of}} all of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> reinforcement forces, and his assistant was the divisional staff officer Han Youlu (...) , who was the original regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade. One reason why Han Youlu was also sent was because Li Wenbin (...) , his replacement after his promotion was selected by the Ma Buluan, the commander of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, but Li Wenbin, the new regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, was not a Muslim and thus might have difficulties in commanding the Muslim troops who were subordinates of Han Youlu, the former regimental commander.|$|R

By October 30, 1945, the 106th Division of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> 40th Army was nearly wiped out, and <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> 30th Army was also badly mauled. Meanwhile, the communist {{chief of staff}} Li Da (李达) personally went to the headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Newly Organized 8th Army and successfully convinced its commander, the deputy commander-in-chief of the 11th War Zone, Gao Shuxun (高树勋) to defect to the communist side. The defection of the most capable fighting unit of <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> force struck a devastating blow on <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> morale and worsened the situation for <b>the</b> remaining besieged <b>nationalist</b> units.

5|$|Elsewhere, French {{public opinion}} was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the far left that Republican ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– on the verge of disaster– were largely in favour, and <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. <b>The</b> <b>Nationalists</b> made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent.

Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have been a success – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain. Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades, a majority of whom were now Spaniards, at the last meeting of the League of Nations, thereby showing his contempt for the Non-Intervention Committee.

5|$|The conference {{failed to}} produce a settlement, {{breaking}} up {{on the same day}} it began with each side blaming the other for its unsuccessful outcome. Smith believed <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> were being unreasonable by requesting preconditions for talks—which they had previously agreed not to do—and asking for diplomatic immunity for their leaders and fighters. <b>The</b> <b>nationalists</b> contended that Smith was being deliberately intransigent and that they did not believe he was sincere in seeking an agreement if he was so adamant about not giving diplomatic immunity. Direct talks {{between the government and the}} Zimbabwe African People's Union followed in December 1975, but these also {{failed to produce}} any significant progress. The Victoria Falls Conference, the détente initiative and the associated ceasefire, though unsuccessful, did affect the course of the Rhodesian Bush War, as they gave the nationalist guerrillas significant time to regroup and reorganise themselves following the decisive security force counter-campaign of 1973–74.
