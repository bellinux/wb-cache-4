50|$|Although DTMF was {{the driving}} {{technology}} implemented in push-button telephones, some telephone manufacturers used push-button keypads to generate pulse dial signaling. Before {{the introduction of}} <b>touch-tone</b> <b>telephone</b> sets, the Bell System sometimes used the term push-button telephone to refer to key system telephones, which were rotary dial telephones that also had a set of push-buttons to select one of multiple telephone circuits, or to activate other features.|$|E
2500|$|North American {{telephone}} customers placing {{calls to}} Mississauga (and other post 1970 Ontario cities) may not recognise the charge details on their billings, as Bell Canada continues {{to use the}} historic community exchanges: Clarkson, Cooksville, Malton, Port Credit, and Streetsville, rather than [...] "Mississauga"; they are combined as a single Mississauga listing in the phone book. <b>Touch-Tone</b> <b>telephones</b> were first introduced at Malton, the first in Canada, on 15 June 1964.|$|R
50|$|When Touch-Tone {{service was}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s, the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) tone generator also required correct polarity as it depended on the line D.C. voltage for operation. Later <b>Touch-Tone</b> <b>telephones</b> included a diode bridge that eliminated the polarity sensitivity, so that consumer telephone service is essentially immune to reversal today. However, some special circuits, such as some direct inward dialing (DID) trunks, T-1 lines, and ground start lines connected to field side (terminal) equipment, e.g., a corporate private branch exchange (PBX) switch, correctly operate only with proper tip and ring polarity.|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>touch-tone</b> <b>telephones</b> {{generate}} twelve DTMF {{signals in}} {{a grid of}} three columns and four rows of buttons, while some special purpose telephones are equipped with a fourth column of key for the A,B,C and D DTMF signals for service priorities in the AUTOVON system. Original sets used a transistor oscillator; newer phones use an integrated circuit. The model 1500 only had push buttons for the 10 digits, while the model 2500 used 12 keys and included the '*' and '#' DTMF signals to allow for extra signaling needed in advanced service features, such as voice response systems and call management.|$|R

5000|$|DTMF {{signaling}} in {{the cable}} industry was discontinued because it was distracting to viewers, and was susceptible to interference when DTMF tones were sounded by characters in television shows.

50|$|Note: The four-digit {{numbers are}} not {{implemented}} in some areas. The codes prefixed with an asterisk (*) symbol {{are intended for}} use on <b>Touch-Tone</b> <b>telephones,</b> whereas the four-digit numbers prefixed 11xx are intended for use on rotary dial <b>telephones,</b> where the <b>Touch-Tone</b> * symbol is not available.Not all NANP countries use the same codes. For example, the emergency telephone number is not always 911: Trinidad and Tobago and Dominica uses 999, as in the United Kingdom. The country of Barbados uses 211 for police force, 311 for fire, and 511 for ambulance, while Jamaica uses 114 for directory assistance, 119 for police force, and 110 for fire and ambulance services.|$|R
50|$|Although {{push-button}} <b>touch-tone</b> <b>telephones</b> {{made their}} debut {{to the general}} public in 1963, the rotary dial telephone still was common for many years. In the 1970s the majority of telephone subscribers still had rotary phones, which in the Bell System of that era were leased from telephone companies instead of being owned outright. Adoption of the push-button phone was steady, but {{it took a long time}} for them to appear in some areas. At first it was primarily businesses that adopted push-button phones. By 1979, the touch-tone phone was gaining popularity, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the majority of customers owned push-button telephones in their homes; by the 1990s, it was the overwhelming majority.|$|R

50|$|A {{genius of}} sonic technology, {{by the age}} of sixteen Rathaway had crafted a {{sophisticated}} flute capable of hypnotizing anyone within range of its sound. He can make anyone do what ever he wants of them, and can even make himself 'invisible' to the perception of others. Although he focused obsessively on sound-based technology in his early years, he later expanded his scope to more general mechanical tinkering. Initially, he employed his mind control techniques almost exclusively on humans (and occasional animals), but during his incarceration in Iron Heights he became infatuated by the prison's ubiquitous rats and incorporated them into his gimmick, adding another similarity to his legendary namesake. He is able to use nearly anything that can create tones for his sonic manipulations, including <b>touch-tone</b> <b>telephones</b> and grass blade whistles. According to Desaad, Rathaway's power is based on the manipulation of the Anti-Life Equation. Rathaway also employs a number of devices that can generate or amplify sound for destructive or protective purposes.|$|R

As analog telephone lines are converted to digital, researchers became interested in digital DTMF detectors. There are many digital DTMF detecting algorithms, but most of them do not comply with the related International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and Bellcore recommen-dations or are not suitable for real-time implementation. In this project, my primary aim was to implement the new DTMF algorithm proposed by M. D. Felder, J. M. Mason, and B. L. Evans on a TMS 320 C 50 digital signal processor for 24 channels. My design tool in this task was Ptolemy, to be more speci c the C 50 domain, which caused several problems during the project. In order to overcome these problems, I started to write a new target for the C 50 domain which is named as SimC 50 due to its ability to run assembly codes on a simulator and display the results. Despite the fact that current C 50 targets generate code for TI TMS 320 C 50 DSP Starter Kit (DSK), the new target generates code for TI TMS 320 C 50 Evaluation Module (EVM). At the time this report was written all the tasks of the new target except getting the results from the simulator part, were nished.

40|$|Proponents {{argue that}} using {{technology}} {{to modernize the}} process of casting a ballot, especially the implementation of remote electronic voting (e-voting), could boost electoral participation. E-voting {{is thought to be}} a particularly important reform designed to encourage turnout among younger people. Evidence to evaluate this claim is available from experiments conducted by the UK Electoral Commission using pilot schemes available to over six million citizens in 59 different English local government districts during the 1 st May 2003 local government elections. These contests are characteristically low-salience events where only a third of the electorate usually cast a ballot. The pilot schemes provide an exceptionally good test of the effects of modernizing electoral administration and voting facilities, as the public in each district cast legal votes in an official contest. The pilots experimented with alternative ways of facilitating remote electronic voting, including use of the Internet from home and public access sites, interactive digital television, SMS text messaging, and <b>touch-tone</b> <b>telephones.</b> Pilots also used all-postal ballots, getting electronic information to voters, and extended voting periods. For comparison, in the remaining areas the public cast a traditional in-person vote by marking crosses on standard paper ballots in local polling stations. The evidence from the aggregate results, and from the post-election survey, confirms that the use of all-postal voting facilities had a significant impact in strengthening turnout by about 15 % on average, as well as improving public satisfaction with the electoral process. Yet claims that remote electronic voting can automatically resuscitate electoral participation should be regarded with considerable skepticism: pilots using remote e-voting combined with traditional polling stations, but without all-postal ballots, proved ineffective in improving overall turnout. The main reason is that all-postal ballots had their most significant impact upon improving voting participation among the older generation, who were already most motivated to vote. In this regard, the simple Victorian postage stamp beats the high-tech microchip hands down. ...|$|R
50|$|Plain old {{telephone}} service (POTS) is a retronym for voice-grade {{telephone service}} employing analog signal transmission over copper loops.
