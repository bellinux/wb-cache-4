5|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} A. McMullen {{noted that}} Kehoe had stopped {{working on his}} farm altogether {{for most of the}} preceding year, and he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be planning suicide. Kehoe had given him one of his horses about April 1927, but McMullen returned it for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Although historians {{differ in}} their {{opinions}} about his relationship, if any, to Kings Edgar the Peaceable and Edward the Martyr, it is generally <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed {{a good relationship with}} King Æthelred II. His daughter Ælfgifu married Æthelred. Thored was ealdorman in Northumbria for much of his reign, disappearing from the sources in 992 after being appointed by Æthelred to lead an expedition against the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|Beorhtwulf and his wife, Sæthryth, {{may have}} had two sons, Beorhtfrith and Beorhtric. Beorhtric is known from {{witnessing}} his father's charters, but he ceased to do so {{before the end of}} Beorhtwulf's reign. Beorhtfrith appears in later sources which describe his murder of Wigstan, the grandson of Wiglaf, in a dispute over Beorhtfrith's plan to marry Wigstan's widowed mother Ælfflæd. Beorhtwulf's death is not recorded in any surviving sources, but it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in 852.|$|E
40|$|This Institutional Reader was {{organized}} by Leonard Dworsky {{as a collection of}} readings and <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believes are important for the student of water and water pollution management in the United States. Some of the material has appeared in print, and some are essentially typed <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wishes to share. [...] Jery Stedinger, friend and colleague, August 2005...|$|R

5|$|Hooper {{was born}} in England but has not {{represented}} the national team at any level. In March 2011 it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may be eligible to represent Scotland. However, this possibility was later closed off. Since his move to Celtic he has been considered for England duty and was called up to the under-21 squad for a friendly but had to pull out due to injury. He was then included in the provisional squad for the 2011 European Under-21 Championship but {{did not go to}} the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all {{relations}} {{with his family}} {{to hide the fact that}} he dropped out of school. His friends <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had drowned in the nearby Mur River. Tesla moved to Maribor, where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to taking the written exam, {{all of the}} applicants {{had to take a}} horse-riding test as well. Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would want to go into the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E
60|$|He {{could hear}} them talking in low, earnest tones; but was so engrossed by his own <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{made no attempt to}} {{distinguish}} the words.|$|R

5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not mention them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He {{did not wish to}} leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.|$|E

None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged; despite Izumo receiving over 20 hits, she only suffered 3 men killed and 16 wounded during the battle. She began repairs at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in mid-September.|$|E

5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and is dressed in traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E
5|$|After he {{returned}} to Australia, Dartnell married Elizabeth Edith Smyth on 15 April 1907 at Holt's Matrimonial Agency on Queen Street, Melbourne. They settled in Fitzroy, and had a daughter in 1908. Little is known about Dartnell's life {{over the next few}} years, though it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> managed his own business and worked as an actor until 1912 or 1913, when he again departed for South Africa. Elizabeth and their daughter remained in Victoria, while Dartnell established himself in East London, a coastal city in the Cape Province. He found employment with the Standard Printing Company, and was a regular contributor to their Saturday newspaper, the Weekly Standard. During this period, he started using the name Wilbur Taylor Dartnell and, according to historian Gerald Gliddon, became engaged to another woman, a Mabel Evans.|$|E
5|$|Beonna (also {{known as}} Beorna) was King of East Anglia from 749. He is notable {{for being the}} first East Anglian king whose coinage {{included}} both the ruler's name and his title. The end-date of Beonna's reign is not known, but may have been around 760. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shared the kingdom with another ruler called Alberht and possibly with a third man, named Hun. Not all experts agree with these regnal dates, or {{the nature of his}} kingship: {{it has been suggested that}} he may have ruled alone (and free of Mercian domination) from around 758.|$|E
60|$|The gloomy look {{returned}} to Arthur's face: and I {{could see it}} was only to distract his <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took his place {{at the side of the}} metaphysical young lady, and resumed their interrupted discussion.|$|R

5|$|Hazlitt's {{commentary}} on Twelfth Night uses Shakespeare's play to illustrate {{some of his}} general ideas about comedy, <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> explored at greater length in later works, such as his Lectures on the English Comic Writers (1819).|$|R
5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from {{his work at the}} Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{also wrote}} commentaries {{on the books}} of Leviticus, the {{historical}} books of the Old Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, and all Pauline epistles, of which the commentary on the Epistle to Galatians shows some of his views prefigure those expressed by both the Waldensians and Protestants centuries later. It was once <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings {{that it was too}} dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
60|$|That gentleman's fury {{carried him}} forward {{at a brisk}} pace, {{and he was so}} {{completely}} occupied in his angry <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never so much as cast a look behind him till he reached his own door.|$|R
60|$|Just then Thorward {{was seen}} {{approaching}} along the beach. His brows were knit, his lips pursed, {{and his eyes}} fixed on the ground. He was so engrossed with his <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not perceive his friends.|$|R
60|$|He drank {{in the air}} luxuriously. Inside him, the wild-cat {{gave him}} a sudden claw, {{but it was a}} half-hearted effort, the effort of one who knows <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is beaten. Mr Meggs was so absorbed in his <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not even notice it.|$|R
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that he believed that the 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E

60|$|Sam was so {{occupied}} with his <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> paid scant {{attention to the}} running of the automobile. As a consequence he went over a number of sharp stones, and a minute later there came a loud report {{from the rear of the}} machine.|$|R
