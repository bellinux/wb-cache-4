5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> and also stated that the court would consider whether <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{continued}} its investigation, issuing five more indictments after Fletcher issued his blanket pardon.

The fifth was issued against Acting Secretary Nighbert for retaliation against a whistleblower. Only the additional charge against Nighbert was alleged to have occurred after Fletcher issued the pardon. On October 24, 2005, Fletcher filed a motion asking Franklin Circuit Court Judge William Graham to order <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to stop issuing indictments for offenses that occurred prior to the blanket pardon; only the names of indicted officials could {{be included in the}} jury's final report. On November 16, Graham ruled that <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> could continue issuing indictments, but in a separate ruling, dismissed the indictments against Fletcher's staff and volunteer advisors on grounds that they were covered by the pardon. Graham did not rule on the latest indictment against Nighbert. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed Graham's ruling on December 16. Immediately after the Court of Appeals' ruling, Fletcher announced his intent to appeal the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|As the Kentucky Supreme Court {{prepared}} to hear Fletcher's appeal on whether <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{could continue to}} indict people covered by his blanket pardon, two of the court's seven justices recused themselves from the case, citing conflicts of interest. Kentucky's constitution provides that, {{in the case of}} more than one recusal on the court, the governor is to appoint special justices to replace them. Accordingly, Fletcher named two replacements, but one of those – Circuit Judge Jeffrey Burdette – declined to serve on grounds that he had contributed to Fletcher's 2003 gubernatorial campaign. Fletcher then named another special justice to replace Burdette, consistent with a precedent set by former Democratic Governor Brereton Jones. Stumbo challenged this third appointment, claiming that Burdette's refusal to serve created only one vacancy on the court, and that the case could be tried with six justices. The Kentucky Supreme Court sustained Stumbo's complaint. In a 4–2 ruling issued May 18, 2006, the Kentucky Supreme Court barred <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> from issuing further indictments against individuals covered by Fletcher's blanket pardon, reversing the Court of Appeals. The ruling did not affect indictments for crimes allegedly committed after the pardon was issued. The Supreme Court also held that <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> could issue a general report of its findings at the conclusion of its investigation, but left open {{the question of whether the}} names of unindicted individuals could appear in the report. A later decision by the Court of Appeals found that unindicted individuals could not be named in the report.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. <b>The</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E
