It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it.

A different version places the cherry tree on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree {{was struck by a}} thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

5|$|Several {{residential}} squares with terraces of three-storey {{houses were}} laid out around central gardens. An example is Portland Square, which was built between 1789 and 1820, and is now largely occupied by offices. In the 1830s, much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the Bristol Riots, and {{to the north of}} the city, Kings Square. The most fashionable areas were at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> as in wet weather the cesspits overflowed down the hill. Further development, though in a less formal manner, continued along the radial roads to Stokes Croft and Cheltenham, towards Horfield and in the St Phillips, Redcliffe and Bedminster areas.|$|E

The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh's had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the area, who consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between the two communities in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland.|$|E
