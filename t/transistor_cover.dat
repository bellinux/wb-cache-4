Each transducer contained a differential pair of two identical p-channel field-effect transistors {{placed on a}} single crystal with the total area of 8  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm. N-type (100) silicon wafer {{was used as a}} substrate. The gate of dielectric layer was formed from thermally oxidized SiO 2 film 50  nm thick and Si 3 N 4 film of the same thickness deposited in the low-pressure reactor. The gate area had zigzag-shaped geometry with the length to width ratio of 100, which provided sufficient gain factor of p-channel transistors. The p-type conducting busses covered with a dielectric layer were used to form the electric contact to the transistor drain and source areas. The crystal with FETs was mounted on the specifically designed printed-circuit boards (5  cm[*]×[*] 0.8  cm) for convenient connection. There were two pH-FETs on each chip, which allows measurements in differential mode to avoid an influence of the non-specific changes in output signal associated with the fluctuations in temperature, environmental pH, and electrical noise. The contact from the chip to the board copper layer was made by ultrasonic welding with an epoxy glue sealing. The signals from both transistors were recorded, and then, the signal from the reference <b>transistor</b> (<b>covered</b> with the “blank” membrane) was subtracted from the signal of the <b>transistor</b> <b>covered</b> with the enzymatic membrane (biorecognition element). The transistors demonstrated pH-sensitivity of approximately 40  mV/pH and transconductance of 400 – 500  μA/V, thus providing pH-sensitivity of the transistor channel current of 15 – 20  μA/pH.|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of biomimetic structures based on one-dimensional nanomaterials and lipid membranes {{will provide a}} unique platform for achieving functionalities of biological machines and mimicking nature at the nanoscale. Silicon nanowires (SiNW) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) are of significant interest due to the novel properties not present in bulk materials as well as characteristic dimensions comparable {{to the size of}} biological molecules. My thesis describes the {{creation of}} fabricated nanomaterials integrated with biomaterials such lipid membranes and their constitutive proteins to create biomimetic assemblies. In the first part of my dissertation, I report transmembrane carbon nanotube pores as a biological ion channel analogs. Biological ion channels in nature transport ions across cellular membranes showing two functions of gating and ion selectivity. CNT pores give structural and functional mimic of an ion channel, in part because smooth, narrow and hydrophobic inner pores of the CNT are remarkably similar to natural biological pores. First, CNTs served as a materials platform that can replicate the features of biological channels. I successfully created ultrashort CNTs (ca. ~ 10 nm) using lipid-assisted sonication-cutting method. Lipid molecules self-assemble on the long CNTs to form a template for sonication cutting. These short CNT pores with their length comparable to the lipid membrane thickness provide a much closer match to protein-channel dimensions. Short CNT pores were incorporated into lipid vesicles to mimic membrane ion channels and study transport properties through CNT pores. These short CNTs in a lipid membrane can transport water, protons, and small ions and reject large uncharged species. Ion rejection in CNT channels is determined by charge repulsion at the CNT rim. Electrophoretic ion transport measurements for individual CNT pores revealed an ion conductance value of 0. 63 ns which is comparable to those of biological channels. CNT pores inserted in the membrane exhibited stochastic gating behavior common for biological ion channels. These fluctuations result from a spontaneous reversible ionic penetration-exclusion transition previously reported in nanofluidic transport of sub- 2 -nm pores. Electrophoretically-driven translocation of individual single-stranded DNA molecules through CNT pores produced well-defined ion current blockades. Overall, short CNT mimics transport properties of a biological protein channel. Since the structure and functionality of short CNT pores self-inserted in a lipid membrane resemble the &# 946;-barrel structure of a porin, they are termed as "carbon nanotube porins". In the second part, I describe synthesis of SiNWs grown via vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Silicon nanowires were grown on silicon substrates via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using silane as a precursor gas and diborane for p-type doing of wires. These nanowires were utilized for a bioelectronics platform for integration of membrane protein functionality based on one-dimensional lipid bilayer. This lipid bilayer provides shielding the nanowires from the solution species and environment for proteins preserving their functionality, integrity, and even vectorality. Here, I report a hybrid lipid bilayer- silicon nanowire bioelectronic device with output controlled via light-induced proton pump protein, bacteriorhodopsin (bR). SiNW field effect transistors (FET) were fabricated via conventional micro/nanofabrication process. bR proteins were incorporated into SiNW <b>transistors</b> <b>covered</b> with a lipid bilayer shell and different ionophore molecules, valinomycin and nigericin were co-assembled to create biologically-tunable bioelectronics devices.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{empirical}} modeling of symmetrical Field-Effect <b>Transistors</b> (FETs). It <b>covers</b> three distinct topics within {{the areas of}} modeling and parameter extraction of microwave FETs. First, the symmetry of FET devices is addressed. Such devices are often used in transceivers as a building block for switches. These devices are intrinsically symmetrical around the gate. Hence, their source and drain terminals are interchangeable. For these devices, the extraction of small signal model parameters is addressed. It is shown that the commonly used small-signal FET model does not translate the intrinsic symmetry of the device into its equivalent circuit. Thus, a big opportunity of {{reducing the number of}} measurement points and the complexity of modeling is overlooked. Therefore, a new small-signal model is proposed to address the intrinsic symmetry present in such devices. Second, the small-signal parameters of the symmetrical model are further improved using a modified optimizer based extraction and a new error expression. This new error function improves the extraction result, and ensures that the symmetry of the device is taken into the account. Finally, the symmetrical small-signal model is extended to find the symmetry in a large-signal model. This leads to the reduction of the intrinsic model so that one current and one charge expression is sufficient to represent its nonlinear behavior. While the modeling procedure is inspired from switch FETs, commonly available devices are symmetrical except for high power transistors. Hence, the modeling procedure which is not limited to switch FETs, can be applied across various device technologies e. g., MOSFET, GaAs pHEMTs/mHEMTs, InP transistors, etc. The applications are also not limited to switches, but include resistive mixers, switch mode oscillators etc...|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{nanowires}} are structures {{made from}} silicon {{with at least}} one spatial dimension in the nanometer regime (1 - 100 nm). From these nanowires, silicon nanowire field-effect transistors can be constructed. Since their introduction in 2001 silicon nanowire field-effect transistors have been studied because of their promising application as selective sensors for biological and chemical species. Their large surface-to-volume ratio promises an increased sensitivity compared to conventional, planar field-effect transistors. Selectivity can be added by smart modification of the surface of the nanowire. The application of nanowire field-effect transistors as chemical sensors for ions is studied in this thesis. After briefly discussing the working principle of field-effect transistors, an extensive review on reported state-of-the-art surface modification techniques is presented. By far, most of this work covers the covalent attachment of molecules to the silicon oxide layer that is typically present on as-prepared silicon nanowires. In addition, some examples on non-covalent approaches have been reviewed. Alternatively, the oxide layer can be removed to attach molecules directly onto silicon. Nanowire field-effect transistors are prepared using top-down fabrication techniques. Nanowires with a width of 20 to 2000 nanometer, a length of 3 to 5 micrometer and a height of 50 to 100 nanometer are etched from silicon-on-insulator wafers. Using a newly developed complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible process, nanowire field-effect transistors are obtained. This process allows for the use of a broad variety of front oxides, which enables selective surface modification of the nanowires and the implementation of materials with different dielectric constants. Furthermore, the presence of a silicon nitride passivation layer on the area around the nanowire provides the possibility to modify only the nanowire surface. Chips typically consist of 28 individual nanowire field-effect transistors. The devices are characterized in air and the variation of the threshold voltage over the wafer is mapped. It is shown that the electrical characteristics make the devices suitable for sensing experiments. The nanowire field-effect transistors are electrically characterized while exposed to water using a newly developed flow cell. A pulsed gate potential is applied as method for stable characterization. While most methods reported in literature use a reference electrode, the pulsed method can be applied without it. Using the sensitivity towards protons of the Si-OH groups at the SiO 2 surface, the pH of aqueous solutions is determined using this pulsed gate potential method. It is found that upon increasing pH the threshold voltage increases, which is as expected. The nanowire field-effect transistors are studied using two types of gating: back gating and front gating through the liquid via an Ag/AgCl electrode. It is found that both methods can be used to gate the device, and that in general smaller potentials are needed for front gating compared to back gating. Using this front-gate method, the influence of the non-aqueous solvent 1, 4 -dioxane on the device characteristics is studied by exposing the devices to different water- 1, 4 -dioxane mixtures. The dependency of the threshold voltage on the mixture composition is found {{to be related to the}} decreased dissociation of the surface silanol groups and the electrical conductivity of the mixture used. In the final experiments, the nanowire field-effect <b>transistors</b> are <b>covered</b> with an ionophore-containing polymer membrane via drop casting. This membrane consists of a silicon rubber polymer (Siloprene), embedding the ionophore valinomycin, which has a K+/Na+ selectivity of ~ 10 ^ 5. Using a setup with liquid gating and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, accurate potassium ion concentrations are determined. Upon exposure of the membrane modified device to sodium ions at a fixed potassium ion concentration, the potential of the device only changes at very high sodium ion concentrations. This confirms the high ion selectivity of the membrane modified device. These results are comparable in line with those obtained using a conventional ion-selective electrode setup. In conclusion, the experiments presented in this PhD thesis lead to an increased understanding of the electrical behavior of nanowire field-effect transistors under different circumstances. This will support the construction and operation of nanowire field-effect sensors, facilitating the further development of advanced sensors. Chemical EngineeringApplied Science...|$|R
