5|$|Animation enthusiasts {{have noticed}} {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film <b>The</b> <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to <b>The</b> <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler, <b>The</b> <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in <b>The</b> <b>Thief</b> and the Cobbler being labeled a rip-off of Aladdin.|$|E

5|$|Hail to <b>the</b> <b>Thief</b> was {{produced}} by longtime Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich in Los Angeles.

5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both <b>the</b> <b>thief</b> and handler, if he could show who <b>the</b> <b>thief</b> was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because <b>the</b> <b>thief,</b> at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place.

At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. <b>The</b> <b>thief</b> chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but <b>the</b> <b>thief</b> falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels held an {{exhibition}} marking {{fifty years of}} The Adventures of Tintin. As part of this, they included artefacts that featured in the series, with the broken-eared Peruvian statue that inspired HergÃ©'s Arumbaya fetish as the centre piece of the show; however, they feared {{that it might be}} stolen, so a replica was exhibited rather than the genuine article. Imitating the events of The Broken Ear, a thief broke in and stole the statue. A letter was then sent to Le Soir in which an individual alleging to be <b>the</b> <b>thief</b> stated that the item would be returned if HergÃ© returned {{to the scene of the}} crime at a certain time with a copy of the book under his right arm. HergÃ© did so, but carried the book under his left arm; <b>the</b> <b>thief</b> never appeared, and the replica fetish was never recovered.|$|E
