5|$|The {{player can}} choose from five skills to {{overcome}} situations: Stealth, Athletics, Lore, Mechanics and Survival. As the player fights more creatures, more information is added to their bestiary. This helps the player collect information about how to attack them effectively. Early in the game, the protagonist will <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> stronghold, which acts as the party's fortress. This can be upgraded.|$|E

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|Since 1887, {{the borough}} has {{included}} the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and small parts of Earley and Tilehurst. By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham {{and still more}} of Tilehurst. A small area of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An attempt to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> small area of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997. Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.|$|E
5|$|Studies and {{environmental}} assessments into various extensions began {{almost immediately after}} the completion of the route to Newmarket in 1989; it would <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> decade for any northward progression to take place. The completion of the route to Davis Drive was met with scorn as traffic in Newmarket rapidly increased as the bedroom community grew with the new highway access. Municipal officials warned prior to the opening of the route that major traffic delays would be faced along Davis Drive. Then-mayor Ray Twinney began an immediate push to widen Green Lane – at that time an unpaved rural route – into a bypass of the town.|$|E

5|$|The Tramp Dentists is a 1913 American silent short comedy film {{released}} by the newly formed Joker productions by the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. Directed by Allen Curtis, the film's cast includes Max Asher, Lee Morris, Eddie Boland Joseph Singleton and Bobby Vernon. The film is centered on two tramps, Dusty and Weary, who <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> dentist shop and get rich through their untrained dentistry, extracting teeth with pincers and ice tongs. After earning {{a large amount of}} money, the tramps return to their old way of life. Released on October 29, 1913, this film was the second Joker comedy. The film received some criticism for its vulgar humor. The film had a wide national release in the United States, but the film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{begins by}} {{describing}} how Hester {{and her family}} (who in the story represent all citizens) live in fear of the Judges, and have virtually no say over their lives. Even on a family picnic in the park they are threatened and intimidated by a judge when their young son accidentally throws a ball at him. Finally deciding that enough is enough, Hester reveals that she has decided to join a terrorist group and <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> television studio at gunpoint to announce their manifesto for reform to the whole city.|$|E
5|$|During {{character}} creation, {{the player}} chooses a class: fighter, ranger, paladin, thief, bard, mage, cleric, druid, barbarian, monk, or sorcerer; {{the last three}} of which are new for the sequel. Different classes have different special abilities and restrictions; a thief character, for instance, can find and remove traps, but thieves have limitations on which weapons and armor they may use, and cannot be of lawful good alignment. Most classes also have a subset of kits, or specializations within a class, from which to choose. Kits have special advantages and, usually, disadvantages; for example, one of the kits of the paladin class, the cavalier, specializes in fighting monsters such as dragons and demons, but cannot use missile weapons. At {{some point in the}} game, the player may join or <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> stronghold. The type of stronghold is determined by the protagonist's class.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} wishes to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate {{dialogue with the}} local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival {{in an attempt to}} impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, the City of Marquette {{agreed to}} {{exchange}} jurisdiction {{over a number}} of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed Bus. US41 and the unsigned M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. Negotiations regarding the transfer centered on MDOT deferring to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway and snowmobile access and the city's assumption of expenses and liabilities related to the business loop. The transfers were made official on October 10, 2005, when MDOT and the city finalized the paperwork. As a result, Bus. US41 was decommissioned when the city took control over Washington and Front streets; signage was removed on November 9, 2005, to complete the process. Some local maps continue to label Bus. US41 through downtown Marquette, even years after the decommissioning of the designation, and some local businesses and organizations still use it in their advertising.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is {{too embarrassed to}} examine the teeth {{of a young woman}} and Potter has to <b>take</b> <b>over.</b> <b>A</b> thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E

5|$|The War of the Ring mode {{carried over}} from the first game in the series {{combines}} turn-based strategy elements with real-time skirmishes. Middle-earth is divided into territories; players can construct buildings to produce troops only in a claimed territory. During each turn, the player can move their armies into neutral and enemy territories {{to take control of}} them. While neutral territories are conquered by simply entering them, enemy territories must be wrested from the other player by defeating them in a skirmish. Troops can be garrisoned in conquered territories to defend against enemy attacks. When the player chooses to attack another territory, or one of their territories is being invaded by an enemy, they can either simulate the match and let the computer determine the outcome, or play the match by commanding the units in real time. The winner of the skirmish gains the territory, and all surviving units gain experience points. To win the game, players must either control the enemy's capital territory, or <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> given number of territories in Middle-earth.|$|E
5|$|The brolga breeds {{throughout}} its range in Australia and New Guinea. The {{start of the}} breeding season is largely determined by rainfall rather than the time of year; thus the season is February to May after the rainy season in the monsoonal areas, and September to December in southern Australia. The flocks split up and pairs establish nesting territories in wetlands. In food-rich habitats, nests can be quite close together, and are often found {{in the same area}} as those of the sarus crane. The nest, which is built by both sexes, is a raised mound of sticks, uprooted grass, and other plant material sited on a small island in shallow water, or occasionally floating. If no grasses are available, mud or roots unearthed from marsh beds are employed. Sometimes the birds make hardly any nest, <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> disused swan nest, or simply lay on bare ground.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{registering}} a domain, {{the user}} signs a declaration {{that they are}} not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume full responsibility for any consequences of use of the domain name. The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> domain name include infringements of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{his second}} effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars and <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> year to craft his second album. West was {{significantly}} inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had {{inspired him to}} incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. Late Registration sold over 2.3million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{hard times}} follow, with the Autobots {{becoming}} a corrupt galactic police force. While shutting down an Energon-mining operation, they incite a riot by beating an outspoken miner to death. The riot is extinguished, {{resulting in the}} miners either dead or imprisoned. A surviving miner, Megatron, manages to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> prison shuttle and hide it in Kaon, the seediest city on Cybertron. Megatron makes {{a name for himself}} in the underground gladiatorial matches, learning to enjoy the kill. He recruits the Seekers, Soundwave, and the future Cassetticons to perform acts of terrorism throughout Cybertron. Megatron rallies a large group of gladiators and proposes for them to unite under the same badge, but they are caught and arrested by Sentinel Prime's police force. However, this is part of Megatron's plan, as Starscream kills the Autobot Senate. Megatron kills Sentinel Prime, and the newly forged Decepticons take over the city-state of Kaon, heralding the beginning of the war. The populace at large is distracted by mass sports race games, with racers like the arrogant but talented Blurr becoming celebrities. Early on during the war, both Autobot and Decepticon try to recruit Blurr to their cause, with a young Optimus talking Blurr into saving the life of Zeta Prime from Starscream's assassination squad. A rookie Tracks is saved from the elite Predacons by special ops soldier Jazz. In later years, Tracks passes on the story of the lone Autobot to boost morale in times of crisis.|$|E
