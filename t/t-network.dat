50|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{applications}} for antenna tuners is in AM and shortwave broadcasting transmitters. AM transmitters usually use a vertical antenna (tower) which can be from 0.20 to 0.68 wavelengths long.

The most commonly used circuit is a <b>T-network,</b> using two series inductors with a shunt capacitor between them. When multiple towers are used the ATU network may also provide for a phase adjustment so that the currents in each tower can be phased relative to the others to produce a desired pattern.

40|$|<b>T-network</b> tuners {{are popular}} for {{matching}} antennas for 160 through 10 meters. Recent articles by Frank Witt, AI 1 H[1] and Andrew Griffith, W 4 ULD,[2] addressed {{how to measure}} tuner loss for various resistive loads; gave some example calculations and measurements; and showed how to adjust the tuner for minimum loss. Measuring your tuner’s loss is the only sure way to know, but by examining the worst case losses at various standing wave ratios, some useful simplifications and estimates of tuner losses can be made. Simple computer programs can accurately analyze your tuner once you know the component values and all the numerical results here can be obtained in this way, but often a “back of the envelope ” calculation can give additional insight. You can, for example, look at a hamfest tuner, or read the advertised specifications of a tuner, and easily make an educated guess {{of the sort of}} power loss that you can expect on 80 and 160 meters. 1 Figure 1 a gives the schematic diagram of a typical <b>T-network</b> tuner. Since most of the loss is in the coil, lossless capacitors are assumed, and coil loss is included by the equivalent parallel resistance QXL. Figure 1 b shows an equivalent circuit where the desired impedance R 0 = 50 ohms in series with the input capacitor C 1 is transformed into its equivalent parallel resistance and reactance. The output resistance R and reactance X in series with the output capacitor C 2 are also transformed into their parallel equivalents.

40|$|The {{instrumentation}} amplifier (IA) {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} blocks in an electrocardiogram recording system. It is the first block in the analog front-end chain that processes the ECG signal from the human body and thus it defines {{some of the most important}} specifications of the ECG system like the noise and common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The extremely low ECG signal bandwidth also makes it difficult to achieve a fully integrated system. 	In this thesis, a fully integrated IA topology is presented that achieves low noise levels and low power dissipation. The chopper stabilized technique is implemented together with an AC coupled amplifier to reduce the effect of flicker noise while eliminating the effect of the differential electrode offset (DEO). An ultra low power operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is the only active power consuming block in the IA and so an overall low power consumption is achieved.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our research}} is to develop system architectures and CMOS circuits that interface with high-Q silicon microgyroscopes to implement navigation-grade angular rate sensors. The MEMS sensor used in this work is an in-plane bulk-micromachined mode-matched tuning fork gyroscope (M² – TFG), fabricated on silicon-on-insulator substrate. The use of CMOS transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) as front-ends in high-Q MEMS resonant sensors is explored. A <b>T-network</b> TIA is proposed as the front-end for resonant capacitive detection. The T-TIA provides on-chip transimpedance gains of 25 MΩ, has a measured capacitive resolution of 0. 02 aF /√Hz at 15 kHz, a dynamic range of 104 dB in a bandwidth of 10 Hz and consumes 400 μW of power. A second contribution {{is the development of}} an automated scheme to adaptively bias the mechanical structure, such that the sensor is operated in the mode-matched condition. Mode-matching leverages the inherently high quality factors of the microgyroscope, resulting in significant improvement in the Brownian noise floor, electronic noise, sensitivity and bias drift of the microsensor. We developed a novel architecture that utilizes the often ignored residual quadrature error in a gyroscope to achieve and maintain perfect mode-matching (i. e. 0 Hz split between the drive and sense mode frequencies), as well as electronically control the sensor bandwidth. A CMOS implementation is developed that allows mode-matching of the drive and sense frequencies of a gyroscope {{at a fraction of the}} time taken by current state of-the-art techniques. Further, this mode-matching technique allows for maintaining a controlled separation between the drive and sense resonant frequencies, providing a means of increasing sensor bandwidth and dynamic range.

40|$|Alternating current {{measurements}} of the effective capacity and resistance of Valonia cells were undertaken {{to determine whether a}} static or polarization capacity was responsible for the large slow time curves of counter E. M. F. produced by the flow of direct current. (For this purpose it was necessary that the cells be in the regular state.) With external contacts at the ends of ceils, a large fall of impedance occurs over the frequency range from zero to 20, 000 cycles, above which the impedance is low and essentially that of the cell interior. As a first approximation to the cell circuit, a simple series-parallel circuit was employed in the bridge balance, with a resistance setting to represent the cell wall (and protoplasmic leakage), shunting the protoplasmic capacity in series with a resistance (sap plus polarization resistance). Both the capacity and its associated series resistance fall off regularly with frequency, giving curved lines on logarithmic plots against frequency, the slope of the resistance plot being steeper, and approaching that of f– 1, although curved to it. These parallel roughly the behavior of a polarizing electrode, which is also shown. Before concluding that the cell's capacity is therefore due to polarization, a further complication of the circuit was considered. This was the effect of the protoplasmic capacity distributed along the wall between the contacts. Both logically and experimentally it was shown that a distributed capacity, as represented by its approximate <b>T-network</b> of resistances and capacities invariant with frequency, could give rise to changes of capacity and series resistance with frequency which simulate to some extent the cellular phenomena. Distributed capacity was therefore reduced in the cells by using shorter air-gaps between the contacts, or abolished by measuring impaled cells, in which the current flow across the protoplasm was entirely radial. These measurements showed a smaller, but still significant change of capacity and of equivalent resistance (in series with it) with frequency, somewhat less than with electrodes, and probably representing the true protoplasmic behavior. It is concluded that the cells display a certain degree of polarization capacity, possibly in parallel with a static capacity invariant with frequency. This might result from an insulating (e. g. lipoid) cell surface, having a residual differential permeability to ions. This structure is consistent with other evidence showing the cells to be chiefly permeable to non-ionized, lipoid-soluble materials, but still displaying electrical effects (conductance, potential difference, polarization) ascribable to ionic mobility...|$|E
