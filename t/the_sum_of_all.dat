5|$|In Vienna, {{two women}} were {{poisoned}} at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of them}} were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> dioxin-like compounds in young people today. She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} SG-1 and General Hank Landry (Beau Bridges) are {{travelling}} on the Earth ship Odyssey to the Asgard home world, Orilla, when the Asgard Thor beams aboard.

However, Orilla and Odyssey are soon attacked by Ori warships. Orilla erupts with huge explosions, and after Odyssey escapes to the next planet with a Stargate and beams the bulk of its crew down, the Ori fire a final energy beam upon the ship. Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) activates a localized time dilation field that makes time look frozen outside the field to give SG-1 and Landry time to find a defense.|$|E
