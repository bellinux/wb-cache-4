5000|$|Room (formerly Room of One's Own) is a Canadian {{quarterly}} literary {{journal that}} features {{the work of}} emerging and established women and genderqueer writers and artists. Launched in Vancouver in 1975 by the West Coast Feminist Literary Magazine Society, or <b>the</b> <b>Growing</b> <b>Room</b> Collective, the journal has published an estimated 3,000 women, serving as an important launching pad for emerging writers. Currently, Room publishes short fiction, creative non-fiction, poetry, art, feature interviews, and features that promote dialogue between readers, writers and the collective, including [...] "Roommate" [...] (a profile of a Room reader or collective member) and [...] "The Back Room" [...] (back page interviews on feminist topics of interest). Collective members are regular participants in literary and arts festivals in Greater Vancouver and Toronto.|$|E
40|$|An {{environmental}} control system proposed here {{was named the}} decentralized autonomous production management system (DAPMS). It was constructed {{based on the idea}} that each plant individual itself could require the desirable environment to the plant production equipments and growers to attach small computer chips. In the DAPMS, each plant individual is an element whose production state and goal are known. A potential function based on this information expresses how well the goals of each element are satisfied. The global discipline in the DAPMS was kept using the potential function in each plant individual. A simulation model of the DAPMS was developed to test this idea. In the simulation, different parts of <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> were characterized by different environmental variables to reflect the situation in a real transplant production facility. Each plant individual was moved (for example, by a robot) to the place within <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> that was best suited for its growth. A reasonable arrangement of the plant individuals was obtained by the DAPMS, even when changes were made in the scale of the facility, the number of plants, and other variables. The DAPMS was applied to cell tray production of sweetpotato transplants in a closed-type transplant production system. Even though <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> had uneven environmental conditions and a variety of transplant individuals, the DAPMS was able to provide a desirable environment to the transplant individuals and to produce transplants with a uniform number of leaves...|$|E
40|$|White button {{mushrooms}} are fragile and discolor soon after mechanical bruising. This hampers {{the development of}} mechanical harvesting for button mushrooms and causes loss of postharvest quality. The extent of discoloration can be affected by environmental conditions. A factorial design analysis was conducted to screen the effect of factors influencing the bruising sensitivity of button mushrooms, {{and to find out}} a combination of environmental factors generating the largest variation among bruising sensitive and bruising resistant strains. In this way a maximal variation of the trait ‘bruising sensitivity’ can be induced in segregating populations intended to map this trait. Three environmental factors were investigated on four genotypes (strains), i. e., thickness of the casing layer (2. 5 cm and 5 cm), wetness of casing (dry and normal), and relative humidity in <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> (80 % and 87 %). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that genotype (strain) was a significant factor influencing bruising sensitivity as well as casing thickness. Significant factor interaction effects were observed. The factor combination generating the largest difference in bruising sensitivity between the four strains was identified, i. e., a thickness of the casing layer of 5 cm, normal humidity of the casing, and 87 % for relative humidity in <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room.</b> <br/...|$|E

40|$|To {{obtain a}} {{reliable}} estimation on the yield of illicit indoor cannabis cultivation in The Netherlands, cannabis plants confiscated {{by the police}} {{were used to determine}} the yield of dried female flower buds. The developmental stage of flower buds of the seized plants was described on a scale from 1 to 10 where the value of 10 indicates a fully developed flower bud ready for harvesting. Using eight additional characteristics describing <b>the</b> <b>grow</b> <b>room</b> and cultivation parameters, regression analysis with subset selection was carried out to develop two models for the yield of indoor cannabis cultivation. The median Dutch illicit <b>grow</b> <b>room</b> consists of 259 cannabis plants, has a plant density of 15 plants/m 2, and 510 W of growth lamps per m 2.

30|$|A {{mushroom}} farm (Sina farm {{located in}} Hamedan area, Iran) was selected where {{the process of}} compost making and mushroom culturing was performed. In this experiment, the compost {{had been made by}} mixing wheat straw, poultry manure, calcium sulfate, sugar beet molasses and urea in amount of 590, 350, 40, 10 and 10 per metric ton, respectively. The mixture passed the composting process for 2  weeks then it was pasteurized and used as substrate after cooling. The spawn of Agaricus bisporus mushroom was prepared by inoculating at 200 – 250  g per square meter on wheat straw based compost. Production and harvesting of mushroom was completed after 8  weeks, then the bags of compost were removed from <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> and the top layer of soil casing was separated and sun dried on a cement bed. The dried MSWS chopped and sampled for chemical analysis.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, some {{treatments}} were missed {{due to the}} pollution in substrate such as ink cap growth. Although applying a pasteurization step assumes that the material used was not already heavily contaminated with microorganisms before it was pasteurized, the pasteurization condition can be revised in further studies. Ink cap (Coprinus spp.) fungi appeared on the substrate before mushroom fruiting. Coprinus indicates the presence of free ammonia or conversely a high content of nitrogen in the compost. On the other hand, the appearance of ink cap fungi in <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> indicates the low quality of substrate due to the disturbance of the fermentation and the substrate’s pasteurization process (Sharma et al. 2007). Sterilized substrate production and containers and use of plant products could considerably minimize the nematode damage to mushrooms and maximize the yields. Therefore, the need for substrate supplementation to complement is necessary to afford the nutrient requirement of the fungi {{in terms of both}} organic (carbon and nitrogen) and inorganic components.|$|E
30|$|Agaricus bisporus A 15 (Sylvan, Kittanning, PA) and its {{derivatives}} {{were grown}} at 25  °C on malt extract agar medium [MEA; 20  gr l− 1 malt extract (BD biosciences, Franklin Lakes, USA), 2.1  gr l− 1 3 -morpholinopropane- 1 -sulfonic acid, pH 7.0, and 1.5 % agar], wheat bran [WB; 4 % wheat bran (w/w) in water], or PII-end compost (CNC Grondstoffen, Milsbeek, the Netherlands). Spawn was produced using {{a mixture of}} 24  gr kg− 1 CaSO 4, 6.87  gr kg− 1 CaCO 3, and 75  gr Sorghum seeds. The seeds had been heated in water at 100  °C for 20  min followed by sterilization for 20  min at 121  °C. The mixture was colonized for 3  weeks at 25  °C using 2 1 -week-old MEA-grown A. bisporus colonies as inoculum. PII-end compost was colonized using 18 boxes per strain (40  cm width ×  60  cm length ×  22  cm height) each containing 16  kg substrate (CNC, Milsbeek, The Netherlands) and each inoculated with 75  gr of spawn. Compost temperature was maintained at 25  °C using an air temperature of 22  °C. RH in <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> was kept at 95 %, while CO 2 levels were 1500 – 2000  ppm. Boxes that had been randomly distributed in <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>room</b> (Unifarm, Wageningen) were overlaid with 7  kg casing layer (CNC, Milsbeek, The Netherlands) after 16  days, after which growth was prolonged for 14  days. The casing was manually broken and mixed (ruffled) to create fast regenerative growth and a more equal distribution of A. bisporus in the casing layer 4  days prior to venting (i.e. 10  days after casing). Venting resulted in a gradual decrease of compost and air temperature to 19 and 18  °C, respectively, while RH and CO 2 levels decreased to 85 % and 1200  ppm. The first buttons {{were removed from the}} bed 9  days after venting. The compost from four boxes of each strain was collected at casing (day 15), venting (day 30), and after the 2 nd flush (day 56). After removing the casing, compost was mixed manually for 3  min, after which samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 20  °C.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Harare (Zimbabwe) in 2004 to investigate the effect of substrate (wheat straw) quantity and shelf position on yield of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sajor-caju) using plastic tray culture. The {{experiment was}} laid out as a 2 -way factorial in a randomized block design with five substrate quantities (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 kg of wheat straw per tray) and two shelf positions (0. 5 and 1. 2 m above ground). Mushroom yield increased with an increased substrate quantity of up to 6 kg and thereafter remained constant. Shelf position had no significant effect (p> 0. 05) on mushroom yield {{and there was no}} interaction (p> 0. 05) between substrate quantity and shelf position on yield. Biological efficiency decreased with an increase in substrate quantity per tray. It was concluded that 6 kg of substrate per tray (50 x 35 and 20 cm deep) would result in optimal yields.

50|$|Some plants (e.g. cultivars of Cannabis sativa subsp. indica), {{can give}} off strong odors as they grow, {{resulting}} in detection of illegal growing operations. Growers frequently use carbon scrubbers and ventilation to control odors. This typically involves forcing air from <b>the</b> <b>grow</b> <b>room</b> through a device containing activated carbon, then venting it outdoors. Others use an ozone generator. Ozone reacts with odor molecules in the air, permanently eliminating them. However, ozone can {{build up to}} levels that may be hazardous both for grower and plant. As a last resort, keeping windows firmly shut and using strong air fresheners can control smells. Checking outside {{to see if any}} smells are emanating from indoors is often a necessary precaution, as many growers become acclimated to the smell, and fail to realize just how pervasive the odor may be. Many store plants in more isolated areas such as a basement or attic to prevent smell detection. Another less common solution is to simply grow a strain with a weaker odor.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 University of Washington Abstract Ultraviolet and Visible Light Exposure Among Indoor Agricultural Workers Maximilian Chmielinski Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Associate Professor Dr. Edmund Seto Department of Environmental and Occupational Hygiene Background: Little is {{documented}} for UV exposure to ‘grow’ lights used by indoor farms {{as well as}} the cannabis industry. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize UV light exposure in nursery and <b>grow</b> <b>rooms</b> in two medical cannabis production facilities using area and personal sampling. Methods: Three different light spectrums were assessed: UV-Broadband (180 to 400 nm), UVA (315 to 400 nm) and blue light (305 to 700 nm). The radiometer hub supported one spectral sensor at a time, therefore the spectrums were assessed consecutively rather than simultaneously. Area surveys were accomplished by consecutively mounting the spectral sensors on a tripod at a fixed height of 1. 6 meters for several minutes per sample. In <b>grow</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>the</b> tripod was systematically moved to 32 to 37 locations; in nurseries samples were taken from 4 to 6 locations. Personal sampling utilized sensors consecutively mounted on a helmet worn by the worker. In each facility, one worker wore each sensor for 20 minute periods in <b>the</b> <b>grow</b> <b>room.</b> Results: In both area and personal sampling, the ACGIH TLV (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Threshold Limit Value) for UV Broadband exposure was exceeded. For area sampling in <b>grow</b> <b>rooms,</b> 8 of 69 (12 %) samples exceeded the UV Broadband TLV of 0. 003 J/m 2 in under 8 hours, and all (n= 10) area nursery room samples exceeded this TLV. In area <b>grow</b> <b>room</b> and nursery samples, the average number of exposure-minutes resulting in a TLV exceedance was 318 and 61 minutes, respectively. Personal <b>grow</b> <b>room</b> sampling in <b>the</b> UV Broadband spectrum resulted in a mean (SD) effective irradiance of 0. 0001 (3. 807 e- 5) Eff mW/cm 2 over a 20 minute interval. At this mean exposure level, the worker did not exceed the UV Broadband TLV during the 20 minute sample but would be projected to exceed the TLV in 446 minutes (less than 8 hours). No sample from any facility or room type exceeded the ACGIH TLVs for UVA or blue light. Conclusion: While data is limited for the three light spectrums surveyed, the UV Broadband spectrum did have samples that exceeded the ACGIH TLV. Nurseries had more UV Broadband exposure than <b>grow</b> <b>rooms.</b> Additional assessment, particularly personal sampling, is needed to more fully characterize cannabis workers’ exposure to UV light. Further research is needed to establish validated UV light sampling methods, to examine the effectiveness of protective equipment, and to establish employer best practices...|$|R
