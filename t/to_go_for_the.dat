5|$|The Sooners had {{the ball}} first in overtime, with Adrian Peterson scoring on their first play. Boise State then drove the ball toward the goal line, but faced fourth-and-two from the five yard line. They then sent quarterback Jared Zabransky into motion and snapped to backup wide {{receiver}} Vinny Peretta, who ran an option pass and found Derek Schouman in the end zone. The Broncos chose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two-point conversion and the win instead of kicking for the tie. They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass {{to the right side}} and handing the ball behind his back to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered the end zone untouched, giving the Broncos a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half, and in their opening drive, Robinson rushed for six yards and threw a 20-yard pass to Drew Dileo before Alabama's defense forced a punt. Alabama's next drive started strong with a 28-yard reception by Kevin Norwood {{and a pair of}} 14-yard runs by T. J. Yeldon. However, McCarron was sacked for a 16-yard loss and as a result, Cade Foster later missed a 52-yard field goal wide left. On the Michigan drive that ensued, the Wolverines stalled at around midfield, but Michigan elected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first down on fourth and three. Robinson then rushed for what was initially ruled a three-yard first down, but later was overturned by video evidence that turned the ball over on downs. Alabama then drove to the Michigan 33-yard-line where Foster connected on a 51-yard field goal that extended the Crimson Tide lead to 34–7. The Wolverines responded on their next possession with their final points of the game after Robinson connected with Devin Gardner for a 44-yard touchdown reception to make the score 34–14 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. After each team again traded punts, on their second possession of the fourth quarter the Crimson Tide started at their own 43-yard-line. On the drive, Jalston Fowler rushed for 25 yards, McCarron passed to Kelly Johnson for 16 yards and Michigan was called for a 15-yard pass interference penalty to set up a one-yard touchdown run for Yeldon and a 41–14 Alabama lead. After this, Michigan and Alabama traded possessions without scoring, and on Michigan's last possession of the game, backup Michigan quarterback Russell Bellomy threw an interception to Alabama's Dillon Lee.|$|E

25|$|Nebraska and Miami {{are known}} for having a bitter bowl rivalry {{that dates back to}} the 1951 season when Nebraska lost the last game of their season to Miami. The most notable event of the rivalry is the 1984 Orange Bowl, in which Nebraska coach Tom Osborne decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{two-point}} conversion instead of an extra point so Nebraska would have the lead and would not settle for a tie. It was unsuccessful, and Miami went on to beat Nebraska 31–30 for a national title.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Vuckovich retired Jorge Orta on a ground ball. Vuckovich then struck out Richie Zisk. For the day, Zisk had four hits in five at bats. With one out <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> win, Jim Spencer hit a line drive to left field but Scott dropped the ball for a two-base error. Oscar Gamble was up at the plate and he {{grounded}} out to the shortstop.

25|$|Against Tennessee, coach Bryant elected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> victory {{instead of}} a tie in the final minutes of the game, and after the failed {{two-point}} conversion the Volunteers held onto a 10–9 victory at Knoxville. Tennessee took an early 7–0 lead {{in the first quarter}} after Richmond Flowers scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Alabama responded later in the quarter with a 28-yard Mike Dean field goal that made the score 7–3. The score remained the same through the fourth quarter when Karl Kremser kicked what was then a SEC record 54-yard field goal that extended the Volunteers lead to 10–3.|$|E

Gleeson's wife Dawn was battling breast cancer at the time and the couple decided to move home to Victoria so they could get more family support to care for their two toddlers. Gleeson said he had always planned to stay in basketball despite his wife's cancer battle and the Crocs had given their blessing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> job.|$|E

25|$|Following {{two short}} running plays, Thomas threw a 16-yard pass to Coale {{for a first}} down. On the ensuing play, David Wilson ran 32 yards for a first down to Michigan's 24-yard line. Josh Ogelsby {{followed}} Wilson's run with an 11-yard run of his own. Ogelsby then rushed for five yards and one-yard respectively. Thomas followed these plays with a three-yard rush, setting up a fourth-and-one at the Michigan 4-yard line. Instead of kicking the field goal {{that would have given}} Tech a 9–0 lead, Frank Beamer decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first down. Thomas was stopped for no gain and Tech turned the ball over on downs.|$|E
25|$|Houston {{took the}} opening kickoff {{and drove to}} the Steelers 40-yard line, but were stopped there and Tony Zendejas missed a 55-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, Steelers rookie Jerry Olsavsky blocked a punt from Greg Montgomery and Pittsburgh {{recovered}} on the Oilers 23. Eventually facing fourth and 1 on the Houston 9-yard line, Steelers coach Chuck Noll decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first down. This paid off as running back Tim Worley took a pitch and ran {{all the way to the}} end zone, evading linebacker Robert Lyles and plowing right through safety Bubba McDowell on the way to a 7–0 Steelers lead with 2:36 left in the first quarter.|$|E
25|$|However, {{her back}} was still painful, more so when she ran shorter distances, so she decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 800 metres at the 1969 European Athletics Championships in Athens that September.

She won her heat comfortably (2:04.2) and then, two days later, produced a superb performance in the final on 18 September sprinting away from her rivals on the final bend and winning by eight metres in a personal best time of 2:01.4, a new championship record.

25|$|Brett Lee had {{dominated}} {{the clash between}} himself and Sehwag for some brief moments when he hit Sehwag on the helmet twice, with just-short of a length deliveries each time. Sehwag also enjoyed a slice of luck, when a comedy of errors by the Australian fielders resulted in a run-out chance being put down. Sehwag had just struck a ball off Lee on the off-side, and had run a single, and had made his mind <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second, but a moment's hesitation, left {{him in the middle}} of the pitch and when the fielder threw the ball to Lee, the bowler, Sehwag was a few yards away from the crease. Unmindful of this, Lee threw the ball to the batting end, where Chopra was struggling to get to. The wicketkeeper, however, dropped the ball, only for Chopra to make it back to the crease in time.|$|E
25|$|England were {{chasing a}} total of 256 runs to win the match, with just under four hours left to play. Scoring rapidly, they reached 150 for 1 wicket. Then Ted Dexter and Peter May got out in quick {{succession}} to Benaud, who was pitching his leg breaks into the rough outside the right-handers' leg stump. This brought Close to the crease. May, the captain, was instructing his players <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> runs and secure the victory. Close accordingly took a calculated risk, and chose to hit out. He took one six off Benaud, but to the tenth ball he faced he played another unorthodox shot which Norman O'Neill caught above his head with two hands. Purists were outraged, and as England collapsed to 201 all out and a 54 run defeat, Close took most of the blame, with some commentators saying that he should never play for England again.|$|E
25|$|Navy {{scored a}} {{touchdown}} {{in the third quarter}} but they missed the potential game-tying extra point. It was the only score of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Navy's Chris Kuhar-Pitters collected a fumble at the Notre Dame 16 yard line and ran it in for a touchdown. Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada rushed for the two-point conversion to take a 28–21 lead – their first of the game. Notre Dame tied the score with a touchdown. The game eventually went to overtime, {{with the aid of a}} questionable decision from Irish head coach Charlie Weis: With 45 seconds left in regulation, Notre Dame faced a fourth-and-8 on the Navy 24; instead of attempting a 41-yard field goal that could have won the game, Weis opted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first down. The gamble backfired in spectacular fashion when Navy sacked quarterback Evan Sharpley, with Midshipmen linebacker Ram Vela literally leaping over a blocker to assist in the sack.|$|E

25|$|Taylor did {{not finish}} {{top of the}} Premier League {{for the first time}} this year. He won eight, drew four and lost four of his 16 matches to finish third in the table. He played Van Barneveld in the semi-finals who he had beaten 7–3 and drawn with 6–6 during the league stage. From 3–3, Taylor surged ahead to triumph 8–4 and book his spot in the final against Van Gerwen. Taylor started the better of the two as he led 5–3 at the break. However, he then lost four {{successive}} legs upon the resumption of play. In the 14th leg, Van Gerwen opted not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bull when on 87 and Taylor stepped in to hit a 160 finish to level the match at 7–7. At 9–8 down, Taylor had left 40 after 12 darts. Nonetheless, Van Gerwen hit a 132 finish on the bull to seal a 10–8 win and the title. After the match, Taylor vowed to ease up on his schedule but increase his practice in order to play his best at the major events.|$|E
25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an extra day of rest due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, {{was supposed to take}} the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout enabled him to get a third day of rest and thus be ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night if he was needed.|$|E
25|$|The Browns scored {{first when}} quarterback Bernie Kosar threw a 6-yard {{touchdown}} pass to running back Herman Fontenot {{at the end of}} an 86-yard drive. But then Cleveland turned the ball over on three consecutive drives. First Ricky Hunley intercepted Kosar's pass on the last play of the first quarter. Then after a punt, linebacker Jim Ryan picked off a Kosar pass and returned it 21 yards to the Browns 9-yard line. Denver then drove to the 1-yard line, but were halted there and decided to settle for Rich Karlis' 19-yard field goal. After the ensuing kickoff, running back Kevin Mack lost a fumble that was recovered by Ken Woodard on the Cleveland 37. On the next play, Denver quarterback John Elway's 34-yard scramble moved the ball to the 4-yard line. Once again, they ended up facing fourth down on the 1-yard line, but this time they decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> touchdown and Gerald Willhite scored on a sweep right. Cleveland managed to respond with Kosar's 42-yard completion to receiver Clarence Weathers, setting up Mark Moseley's 29-yard field goal to tie the score at 10 with less than a minute left in the half.|$|E
