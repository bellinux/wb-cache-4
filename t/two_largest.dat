2500|$|In {{celestial}} mechanics, the Lagrangian points ( [...] ; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are {{positions in}} an orbital configuration of <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies {{where a small}} object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. The first three {{are on the line}} connecting the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies; the last two, L4 and L5, each form an equilateral triangle with the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. The <b>two</b> latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies.|$|R

Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's <b>two</b> <b>largest</b> moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, {{claimed to have}} observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.|$|E
5|$|Juno, minor-planet {{designation}} 3 Juno in the Minor Planet Center catalogue system, is {{an asteroid}} in the asteroid belt.

50|$|The <b>two</b> <b>large</b> squares {{shown in}} the figure each contain four {{identical}} triangles, and {{the only difference between}} the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> squares is that the triangles are arranged differently.

25|$|In astronomy, Lagrangian {{points are}} five {{positions}} in the orbital plane of <b>two</b> <b>large</b> orbiting bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. The first three Lagrangian points (L1, L2, L3) lie along the line connecting the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies, while the last two points (L4 and L5) each form an equilateral triangle with the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies. The L4 and L5 points, although they correspond to maxima of the effective potential in the coordinate frame that rotates with the <b>two</b> <b>large</b> bodies, are stable due to the Coriolis effect. The stability can result in orbits around just L4 or L5, known as Tadpole orbits, where trojans can be found. It can also result in orbits that encircle L3, L4, and L5, known as horseshoe orbits.|$|R
