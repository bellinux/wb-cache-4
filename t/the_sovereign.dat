5|$|The Chapel of the Order is the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. Every four years, an {{installation}} ceremony, {{presided over by}} the Great Master, and a religious service are held in the Chapel; <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> attends every alternate ceremony. The last such service was in May 2014 and was attended by <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sovereign</b> and each knight who has been installed is allotted a stall in the choir of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sovereign</b> is {{traditionally}} advised by various counsellors, including the peers of the realm. After the Norman conquest of England, peers were summoned {{to form the}} magnum concilium, or Great Council, {{which was one of}} the four councils belonging to <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign.</b> The other three were the Privy Council, Parliament (which was called the commune concilium, or Common Council), and judges (who are considered counsellors of <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> on legal matters).|$|E
5|$|The monarch has {{a similar}} {{relationship}} with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>Sovereign</b> appoints the First Minister of Scotland on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament, and the First Minister of Wales on the nomination of the National Assembly for Wales. In Scottish matters, <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> acts {{on the advice of}} the Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>Sovereign</b> can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the state}} of Massachusetts, the second area of {{greatest}} penetration by <b>the</b> <b>Sovereigns</b> of Industry was in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Some 11,500 people {{were said to have}} joined <b>the</b> <b>Sovereigns</b> in that state, taking part in 78 local councils.|$|R

5|$|From the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> {{made his}} or her choices {{on the advice of}} the Government. In 1946, with the {{agreement}} of the Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Leader of the Opposition Winston Churchill, membership of the United Kingdom's highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St. Patrick) became a personal gift of <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> once again. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, and need not act on or solicit the advice of His or Her Government.|$|E
5|$|In Commonwealth realms {{other than}} the UK, royal assent is granted or {{withheld}} either by the realm's sovereign or, more frequently, by the representative of <b>the</b> <b>sovereign,</b> the governor-general. In federated realms, assent in each state, province, or territory is granted or withheld by the representatives of <b>the</b> <b>sovereign.</b> In Australia, this is the governors of the states, administrators of the territories, or the governor-general in the Australian Capital Territory. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to <b>the</b> <b>sovereign.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Scottish heraldry, use of the banner is not restricted to <b>the</b> <b>sovereign.</b> Several Great Officers of State who officially represent <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> in Scotland are permitted to use the Royal Banner of Scotland, including; the First Minister of Scotland (as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland), Lord Lieutenants within their respective Lieutenancies, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms and other lieutenants who may be specially appointed by <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sovereign</b> has {{historically}} {{had the power}} to choose Knights of the Order. From the eighteenth century onwards, <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned to the personal gift of <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign.</b>|$|E

5|$|The monarch's {{official}} flag in the United Kingdom is the Royal Standard, which {{depicts the}} Royal Arms in banner form. It is flown only from buildings, vessels and vehicles in which <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> is present.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sovereign</b> {{does not}} have the power to {{withhold}} assent from a bill against the advice of ministers. The last bill that was refused assent by <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> (on the advice of ministers) was the Scottish Militia Bill during Queen Anne's reign in 1708.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sovereign</b> {{exercises}} executive {{authority by}} making Orders in Council upon {{the advice of}} the Privy Council. Orders-in-Council, which are drafted by the government rather than by <b>the</b> <b>sovereign,</b> are secondary legislation and are used to make government regulations and to make government appointments. Furthermore, Orders-in-Council are used to grant Royal Assent for Measures of the National Assembly for Wales, and laws passed by the legislatures of British Crown dependencies.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Sovereigns</b> of Industry {{maintained}} a friendly {{relationship with the}} Granger movement, the organization's relations with the existing trade unions tended to be frosty. Many local unions of the era were organized into lodges and {{the rapid growth of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sovereigns</b> of Industry engulfed them. Moreover, some unions began to see the Order as part of the problem, trying to bid down labor costs in an effort to obtain commodities for their cooperative stores as cheaply as possible. One October 1875 attack on the Order in the National Labor Tribune charged that [...] "the only object of <b>the</b> <b>Sovereigns</b> is to buy cheap, if they have to help reduce wages to a dollar a day to do it." ...|$|R

5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> acts on {{the advice}} of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for <b>the</b> <b>sovereign,</b> a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume on the history of <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E

Two senior knights of the order assist <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> in these ceremonies by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight and by assisting <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight, and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar. After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.|$|E
