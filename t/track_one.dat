5|$|Vienne and Perez held several {{meetings}} on the <b>track,</b> <b>one</b> {{including the first}} appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and then looked for further ideas. In February 1896 they hit {{on the idea of}} holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems. The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E
5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the <b>track.</b> <b>One</b> possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|Tyrone Anthony Wheatley, Sr. (born January 19, 1972) is {{the running}} backs {{coach of the}} NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and a former {{professional}} American football player who played 10seasons in the National Football League (NFL) {{and was one of}} the most successful high school and collegiate athletes in Metropolitan Detroit history. In high school, he was a member of state-champion teams in both track and field and football, and he was named Michigan's track and field athlete of the year and football athlete of the year in the same academic year. He earned All-America track honors in both high school and college. Following his graduation as one of Michigan's best high school athletes, he attended the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship and earned first-team All-Big Ten Conference honors on Big Ten Champion football and track teams. He ranks among the Wolverines' all-time rushing leaders in numerous categories, and his name appears in several places in the Big Ten football record book. He was named to All-Big Ten teams in football and track and field a total of four times, and he earned portions of seven Big Ten championships (two team awards for football, one team award for indoor <b>track,</b> <b>one</b> award for 110 meter hurdles, and three awards for individual football statistical performances).|$|E

25|$|In October 1919 an amended {{route to}} Beeston was proposed, {{incorporating}} {{an extension of}} this route to Chilwell.

A further proposal was for {{the extension of the}} Bulwell line to Hucknall. These proposals were carried by the Council, with only one dissension.|$|E
25|$|While {{awaiting}} {{his court}} appearance for the café incident, Ant attempted several fresh musical projects. In 2003, Ant and Wonderful collaborator, Boz Boorer, teamed with the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund (now called The Gorilla Organisation) in a reworking of Stand and Deliver as Save the Gorillas. This {{was to have}} been the title track for a five-track EP, together with four primate/jungle-themed covers. Originally intended as a benefit record for the endangered mountain gorilla, it was never released, due to copyright and licensing issues relating to the title <b>track.</b> <b>One</b> track from the EP, Jungle Rock, was eventually released on Boorer's 2008 solo LP Miss Pearl.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 June 1949 a fire {{broke out in the}} tenth coach of an express {{passenger}} train from Edinburgh to King's Cross, {{about two and a half}} miles beyond Cockburnspath. The train stopped somewhere near the tunnel, within one and a quarter minutes of the fire starting, but the fire spread rapidly and with such ferocity that, within seconds, the brake-composite carriage was engulfed and the fire had spread to the coach in front. Most passengers escaped by running to the guard's compartment or forwards along the corridor, but some were compelled to break the windows and jump down onto the <b>track.</b> <b>One</b> lady was seriously injured by doing this.|$|E

25|$|Geotechnically, the {{accident}} was investigated by performing both test drilling and strength calculations on site. The investigation into the cause of {{the accident}} had a major impact {{on the development of the}} field of geotechnics in Sweden. The scene of {{the accident was}} cleared in autumn 1918 so that the train line could be reopened by December. This was made possible by shifting the <b>track</b> <b>one</b> metre towards the side of the mountain and by reinforcing the embankment with rocks. At the site of the accident, the speed limit was lowered to 15km/h, with the speed limit on either side of that stretch of track being 30km/h. In modern times, the speed limit has been set at a flat 100km/h.|$|E
25|$|Caribou are {{monitored}} {{through a}} capture and collaring with VHF or Global Positioning System (GPS) collars tracking collars. Satellite tracking Argos system, a satellite-based system collects, processes and disseminates {{the data from}} caribou tracking collars, clearly locating exact geographically coordinates. Satellite networks have tracked the migration and territorial movements of caribou. Electronic tags are giving scientists a complete, accurate picture of migration patterns. Using radio transmitters to <b>track</b> <b>one</b> herd of caribou, scientists learned that the herd moves much more than previously thought and they learned that each year the herd returns to about the same place to give birth. Environment Canada uses Landsat satellite imagery, for example, to identify anthropogenic disturbance (human-caused disturbance) to the natural landscape. This includes roads, seismic lines, pipe lines, well sites, and cutblocks that accompany industrial activities such as {{oil and gas exploration}} and development and forestry. British Columbia uses telemetry and computer modelling.|$|E
25|$|The Lieråsen Tunnel was {{launched}} {{as a project}} to cut distance and travel times between Asker and Drammen, as the Drammen Line was nearly twice the length compared to a straight line. The first proposals were developed by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in the early 1940s, albeit at first for a single track. During the process of double tracking the Drammen Line between Asker and Sandvika, NSB launched a proposal to build two additional sections of double <b>track,</b> <b>one</b> from Hokksund to Drammen and one from Brakerøya to Asker. For the latter two main proposals were made: one which would run from the old Lier Station to Asker and a shorter direct tunnel. The advantage of the former was the ability to still serve Lierbyen and smaller construction costs, while the latter would give a shorter overall line length. NSB called for prioritizing the Drammen–Hokksund segment if there was not funding for both.|$|E

500|$|However, The Guardians Alexis Petridis {{review was}} very negative.

Similarly, Matt D'Cruz from Drowned in Sound also criticised Burgess' [...] "strained" [...] vocal, calling it [...] "proving a poor fit for the Chems' stuttering rave pianos and ponderous beats." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media agreed on the [...] "unremarkable verses and nasally vocals", although the song, along with [...] "Galvanize", {{reminded him of the}} duo's [...] "early B-Boy/techno days," [...] but both of them missing the ferocity and sub-bass rattlings of their [...] "earlier cousins."

500|$|Bradley Stern of MuuMuse {{said the}} song is [...] "all sorts of throwback '80's-R ferociousness, {{blending}} dirty-minded temptation with a seriously fierce strut a la Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul— {{and a bit of}} Divinyls' 'I Touch Myself'." [...] In his album review, he described the song as [...] "a purely Prince/Vanity 6-inspired production, seductively sauntering into the speakers across a nasty, smutty slap of a beat".
