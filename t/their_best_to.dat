5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> leave them stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding {{it to be a}} surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} and did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> {{restrict}} Liverpool's passing {{game in the}} opening 45 minutes through tackling and quick counter-attacking with the long ball; with the game's flow interrupted and the two teams cancelling each other out, neither side built any momentum {{in the first half}} with few clear-cut chances. The first notable action came for Arsenal when a cross from Michael Thomas on the right which was met by Steve Bould, but Steve Nicol cleared it over the bar for a corner. Liverpool responded with a shot from outside the box from Rush after being teed up by Aldridge. However, soon after Rush was forced to go off with a groin strain and had to be replaced by Peter Beardsley in the 32nd minute. The score was 0–0 at half time.|$|E

5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions between East and West, Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their own team. They made a major breakthrough when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships. The East Germans did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> get Brundage's support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted full membership, with their own team under their own flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich. Brundage, while finally supporting full membership for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.|$|E

While the staff try <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> keep their jobs, Liz struggles with making a {{decision}} of whom to fire. Liz's problem is solved when Floyd, for whom Liz has romantic feelings, tells her that his girlfriend works in accounting at TGS. After Liz fires Floyd's girlfriend, she goes on a rampage around 30 Rock firing people, including her producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), who disagrees with her decision to fire Floyd's girlfriend for her own personal gain. Jack later tells her that he hired all the fired people back, but he is transferring Floyd's girlfriend to General Electric headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|New York, Boston, and Philadelphia did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> outdo {{each other}} in the {{celebrations}} honoring Lafayette. Needing a place to hold a reception for him, Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today Independence Hall), which might otherwise have been torn down. Until that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit set off a wave of construction, usually with Lafayette, in his capacity as Mason, laying the cornerstone. The arts benefited by his visits as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original thirteen states during a four-month visit; the stay stretched to sixteen months as he visited all twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{defeated}} Romania 37 to 0 {{in front}} of a crowd of 6,000. France then defeated Romania 61 to 3 and entered the final game as favorites. The gold medal game was played on 18 May {{in front of}} 21,000 spectators at the Colombes venue, which had a large wire fence built around the field for the game. The U.S. defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport. At the final whistle the pitch was invaded and the French team, aided by the police, did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> protect their opponents. The medal ceremony took place with police protection – gold for the U.S., silver for France, and bronze for Romania.|$|E
5|$|While Cope and Marsh dueled for fossils in the American West, {{they also}} tried <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> ruin each other's {{professional}} credibility. Humiliated by his error in reconstructing the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus, Cope {{tried to cover}} up his mistake by purchasing every copy he could find of the journal {{in which it was}} published. Marsh, meanwhile, made sure to publicize the story. Cope's own rapid and prodigious output of scientific papers meant that Marsh had no difficulty in finding occasional errors with which to lambast Cope. Marsh himself was not infallible; he put the wrong skull on a skeleton of Apatosaurus and declared it a new genus, Brontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|While Margaret {{was still}} an infant, William lost his job {{and was unable to}} find regular work. The family {{suffered}} hardship, with the threat of the workhouse a constant fear. Nevertheless, William and Ann did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> ensure that their children were educated and prepared for life. Margaret was a clever child, whose skills at reciting poetry or playing piano pieces were often displayed at town events and Sunday School outings. Until the age of 13 she attended the local elementary school; she then worked for a year as a pupil-teacher (she was paid three shillings a week) in the school's boys' department. Local employment opportunities being scarce, she left Chard in 1887, at the age of 14, to begin an apprenticeship at a draper's shop in Hove, near Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the attackers}} {{seem to have}} wanted to force the Jews to convert, {{although}} they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto {{to protect them from}} Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home. The attacks on the Jews were witnessed by Ekkehard of Aura and Albert of Aix; among the Jewish communities, the main contemporary witnesses were the Mainz Anonymous, Eliezer ben Nathan, and Solomon bar Simson.|$|E
5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, {{they were forced to}} break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews {{had no way of knowing}} that the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E

5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities did <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming {{on top of the}} previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices {{for the remainder of the}} medieval period.|$|E
