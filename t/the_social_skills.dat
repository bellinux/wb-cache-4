5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

25|$|Supportive {{psychotherapy}} is {{also used}} in an inpatient or outpatient setting by a trained professional that focuses on areas such as coping skills, improvement of social skills and social interactions, communication, and self-esteem issues. People with SPD {{have a tendency to}} miss differences that causes an inability to pick up environmental cues and limits their experience. The perception of varied events only increases their fear for intimacy and limits them in their interpersonal relationships. Their aloofness may limit their opportunities to refine <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and behavior necessary to effectively pursue relationships. Socialization groups may help people with SPD. Educational strategies in which people who have SPD identify their positive and negative emotions also may be effective. Such identification helps them to learn about their own emotions and the emotions they draw out from others and to feel the common emotions with other people with whom they relate. This can help people with SPD create empathy with the outside world.|$|E

Strong <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> can facilitate interpersonal interactions, which can in turn lead to effective job outcomes. Although the change in organizational structures and <b>the</b> importance of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> have heightened awareness of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> in organizational outcomes, little is known about what <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> is and its role in influencing work outcomes. In this study, I provide some insight into the definition and measurement of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> and how <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> influences job and career success outcomes. Based on my review of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> literature, I defined <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a learnable social behavior used to achieve social goals. Further, I proposed an integrated <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> framework that theorized <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a higher-order construct with three sub-factors: social presentation, social scanning, and social flexibility. I conducted three studies to develop a measure of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> and examine <b>the</b> antecedents and outcomes of <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> <b>The</b> results, based on over 400 employees, show that personality factors, such as self-monitoring and extraversion, {{have a positive effect on}} <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> <b>The</b> findings also suggest that <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> successfully predicts <b>the</b> number of mentors, mentoring received, social support, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between certain demographic variables and <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels of university students. Material and Methods: There were 100 participants (n= 51 female, n= 49 male) in the study group who were the students at the department of Sport Sciences Faculty of Istanbul University in the 2015 - 2016 academic year. Of the study group 28 participants were between 18 - 20 years old, 27 participants were between 21 - 23 years old, 23 participants were between 24 - 26 years old and 22 participants were above 27 years old.
