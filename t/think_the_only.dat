Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing I said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E

Prior to his appearance, Reynolds was referenced in several episodes of the series. Series creator Adam Reed opined: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{person on the}} planet who's a bigger fan of Burt Reynolds than me is Sterling Archer. Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing." [...] After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added {{a scene in which}} Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films. [...] "We sent him the script beforehand and he noted the script up pretty good. But it was all to make it more self-deprecating." [...] Reed, a fan of Reynolds, said that working with him was a great experience. [...] "It was such a surreal experience being in the room with Burt Reynolds, my childhood hero," [...] he affirmed.

[...] At trial, he noted, some of the items the village claimed had been purchased at the Flipside turned out to have been, in fact, acquired at other shops.

But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May.

[...] (p.76), {{and went on to}} say that [...] "Contrary to general belief, Madhubala is rather simple and unassuming" [...] (p.78). This is echoed in Madhubala's sister's {{interview}} with Filmfare: [...] "(Madhubala) became a craze because she was never seen in public. She wasn't allowed to attend any function, any premiere. She had no friends. But she never resisted, she was obedient. Being protective, my father earned the reputation of being domineering". Dilip Kumar added: [...] "She was extremely popular... and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> star for whom people thronged outside the gates. Very often when shooting was over, there’d be a vast crowd standing at the gates just to have a look at Madhu... It wasn’t so for anyone else. That was her personal effect on fans. Her personality was vivacious." [...] But, [...] "She was aware of her beauty," [...] reminisces B. K. Karanjia, former Filmfare editor and a close friend of both Madhubala and her father, [...] "and because there were so many in love with her, she used to play one against the other.
