He's very disciplined, he's good-looking, and all the sisters want him." [...] Sanders enjoyed the food so much, she agreed to come back and meet the woman's minister. At the second dinner, the nurse's aide told her the minister was present and Sanders <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "Big deal." [...] In 1992 she recalled how her demeanor changed when she caught a glimpse of MalcolmX: ...|$|E
500|$|Milian's second studio album, It's About Time, was {{released}} in the US on July 13, 2004. The critical response to the album was mixed; the club tracks, most notably lead single [...] "Dip It Low", were praised while the ballads {{were said to be}} disappointing. The style and sound of the album was compared to that of Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez by several critics. Milian later admitted that her new sexy image for [...] "Dip It Low" [...] and the whole album was mainly for shock value. She had to make her way back into the US market, and by choosing a sexier image, she made a name for herself. [...] "Dip It Low" [...] was also meant to show that she was not the same 18-year-old girl in the [...] "AM to PM" [...] video. To create her new image, Milian also decided to change her appearance and lightened her hair. Taking inspiration from Janet Jackson who constantly changed her image, Milian <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "'When did I like Janet Jackson the most?' It was when she had her lightened hair." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Swift and {{produced}} by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, [...] "He came across as prince charming." [...] As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. [...] "And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was," [...] she said. She wrote [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] in an emotional state, which she described as [...] "the breaking point", where she <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "'You know what? Don’t even {{think that you can}} keep on hurting me.'" [...] The circumstances reached a point where she felt she had to walk away. [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on October 28, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store. The song was reissued on March 5, 2009, as remix, the same day she made her guest appearance on the television series [...] in the episode [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn". The remix was featured in the episode.|$|E

"'Er own {{daughter}} {{was sitting there}} beside 'er with 'alf a dozen silver bangles on 'er wrist, and a sort of thing 'anging around 'er neck, as, 'ad it been real, would 'ave been worth perhaps a thousand pounds.

500|$|Swift self-penned [...] "Our Song" [...] for {{the talent}} show of her {{freshman}} {{year in high school}} with no intentions of including it on her debut album. She <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relatable to her classmates. [...] "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one", she said. The writing process, as with her lead single [...] "Tim McGraw", took place in approximately 20 minutes. Several months after performing it at the talent show, some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show, singing a few lines. [...] "They'd only heard it once, so I thought, 'There must be something here!'", Swift recalled. When choosing tracks to record for Taylor Swift, Swift [...] "stood by" [...] "Our Song", repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her. She claimed she [...] "knew there was something about it." [...] She concluded, [...] "I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing." [...] Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on Taylor Swift due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase [...] "Play it again", which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album. Big Machine Records executives chose [...] "Our Song" [...] to be the third single from Taylor Swift, which Swift was surprised yet glad about.|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga the Grammy {{performance}} {{was inspired by}} many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E

[...] Before they officially started to date in 1997, they hung out together at a bar and Larry kept putting quarters in the jukebox, playing romantic songs by Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline. [...] This was when he was still drinking, and Bambi wrote that at one point he started crying, and said to her, “No one else is ever really going to know my soul". And Bambi <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> “I will. I could do that.” ...|$|E

60|$|Billy {{was seldom}} heard to cry. Perhaps he had wept all his stock of tears away, before {{he entered the}} house. He had seldom fits of bad temper, and was a really lovable child. Mrs. Dickson never wavered in the opinion she had first formed--that the dead tramp was not Billy's mother--but as no one else agreed with her, she kept her <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|Happy! <b>thought</b> Fanny <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> No, indeed, I'm not happy! She didn't say so, however; and Kilcullen, after {{a little}} while, went on speaking.|$|R

Liz' best friend, Mary Jane, has also told Liz to keep her mutant phobia <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> when she's around MJ, and that she'd prefer it if Liz kept those <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> in general.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a perfect}} daughter, or daughter-in-law!" [...] she <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> {{and could not}} help {{contrasting}} her with Cassandra, surrounded by innumerable silkworms in her bedroom.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] <b>thought</b> Augusta <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "how {{on earth}} do {{they all get}} a living?" [...] a {{question}} {{that many of them}} would have found it hard enough to answer.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps {{her heart}} leapt as she <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "At last it is coming, I knew it would!" [...] {{but she only}} made some {{innocent}} note of attention.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I'll have ONE, please,' said Alice, {{as she put}} {{the money}} down on the counter. For she <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> 'They mightn't be at all nice, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beautiful but dangerous," [...] said Sandra, {{immediately}} {{talking to}} {{her husband in the}} presence of a third person. ("Ah, an English boy on tour," [...] she <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.)</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Returns by {{the mail}} train tonight, <b>thought</b> Eleanor <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> as she strove {{to screw up}} her courage;--away again tonight;--then it must be now or never; and she again sat down, having risen to go.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy that it {{has arrived}} in that poor man's case," [...] <b>thought</b> Mary <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> Lady Jones, who also knew Mrs. Tomley {{and the power of}} her tongue, nodded her head sympathetically and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} would,' <b>thought</b> Mary <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> as {{she looked back at}} him: 'what a {{quantity}} of kind, right feeling there in under that odd, dry manner, that strives to appear to love nothing but a joke.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm {{not used}} to it!" [...] pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone, and she <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> [...] "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!" ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they sat}} down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> 'I don't {{see how he}} can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.|$|E

Iwasato Yuho is also considered as a secretive person on her whereabouts nor biographical details, but she never keeps her <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> and always kept them written in songs for people around the world to discover her through it. Piece of my Wish which was sung in 1991 by Miki Imai has given a mark in history to one of her works. A beautiful song of friendship in between lovers who were far apart.|$|R
