5|$|It was {{announced}} on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the {{contract for the}} production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket, Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for <b>the</b> <b>Economics</b> Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of <b>the</b> <b>Economics</b> medal. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} current decline of <b>the</b> relationship between <b>economics</b> and <b>the</b> history of <b>economics,</b> and proposes a framework called the panorama-cum-scenario {{model for the}} practice of <b>the</b> history of <b>economics.</b> Starting with <b>the</b> Hegelian thesis that <b>the</b> history of <b>economics</b> is <b>economics</b> itself, <b>the</b> paper argues that such a relationship is necessary but not sufficient because <b>the</b> history of <b>economics</b> is a metatheory addressed to economic theory. <b>The</b> history of <b>economics</b> needs a panoramic view of the subject and a scenario for the construction, interpretation, and evaluation of <b>the</b> system of <b>economics.</b> <b>The</b> panorama-cum-scenario model enables us to work on <b>the</b> history of <b>economics</b> not only by historical and rational reconstruction but also by global reconstruction. Nietzsche's anti-Hegelian viewpoint and Heidegger's hermeneutical standpoint are useful for identifying the role of historical research in developing economic knowledge based on the panorama-cum-scenario model. Several approaches to <b>the</b> history of <b>economics</b> are examined in light of the panorama-cum-scenario model. Schumpeter's history of economics is interpreted {{as an example of the}} panorama-cum-scenario model. Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Schumpeter, historicism, panorama-cum-scenario model,...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>economics</b> of fission–fusion designs {{have always}} been questionable. The same basic effect can be created by {{replacing}} the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E

5|$|By the 14th century, castles were {{combining}} defences with luxurious, sophisticated {{living arrangements}} and landscaped gardens and parks. Early gunpowder weapons {{were used to}} defend castles {{by the end of}} the 14th century and gunports became an essential feature for a fashionable castle. <b>The</b> <b>economics</b> of maintaining castles meant that many were left to decline or abandoned; in contrast, a small number of castles were developed by the very wealthy into palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid elaborate architecture. Smaller defensible structures called tower houses emerged in the north of England to protect against the Scottish threat. By the late medieval period, town walls were increasingly less military in character and more often expressions of civic pride or part of urban governance: many grand gatehouses were built in the 14th and 15th centuries for these purposes.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by Dennis Robertson). Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} the fellowship, because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people. From 1968 to 1978, he and Paul Samuelson participated in <b>the</b> <b>Economics</b> Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.|$|E
