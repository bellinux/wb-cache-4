40|$|SummaryObjectiveMicrofracture is used {{to treat}} {{articular}} cartilage injuries, but leads {{to the formation of}} fibrocartilage rather than native hyaline articular cartilage. Since bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP- 7) induces cartilage differentiation, we hypothesized that the addition of the morphogen would improve the <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> generated by microfracture. We determined the effects of these two treatments alone and in combination on {{the quality and quantity of}} <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> formed in a model of full-thickness articular cartilage injury in adolescent rabbits. DesignFull-thickness defects were made in the articular cartilage of the patellar grooves of forty, 15 -week-old rabbits. Eight animals were then assigned to (1) no further treatment (control), (2) microfracture, (3) BMP- 7, (4) microfracture with BMP- 7 in a collagen sponge (combination treatment), and (5) microfracture with a collagen sponge. Animals were sacrificed after 24 weeks at 39 weeks of age. The extent of healing was quantitated by determining the thickness and the surface area of the <b>repair</b> <b>tissue.</b> The quality of the <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> was determined by grading specimens using the International Cartilage Repair Society Visual Histological Assessment Scale. ResultsCompared to controls, BMP- 7 alone increased the amount of <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> without affecting the quality of <b>repair</b> <b>tissue.</b> Microfracture improved both the quantity and surface smoothness of <b>repair</b> <b>tissue.</b> Compared to either single treatment, the combination of microfracture and BMP- 7 increased both the quality and quantity of <b>repair</b> <b>tissue.</b> ConclusionsMicrofracture and BMP- 7 act synergistically to stimulate cartilage repair, leading to larger amounts of <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> that more closely resembles native hyaline articular cartilage...|$|R

Discrimination of structural cartilage differences in patients with osteoarthritis is critical, yet challenging. This study assesses the variation in the optical attenuation coefficient (OCT) between healthy cartilage, <b>repair</b> <b>tissue,</b> bone and layers within <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> in a controlled setting. OCT and histology was used to assess goat talus articular surfaces in which central osteochondral defects were created. Exact matches of OCT and histology were selected for research. OCT measurements were taken from healthy cartilage, <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> and bone. Measured μOCT in healthy cartilage was higher compared to both <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> and bone tissue. Two possible mechanisms for the difference in attenuation were investigated. We studied morphological parameters in terms of nucleus count, nucleus size and inter-nucleus distance.

40|$|To {{determine}} if expression of specific proteoglycan epitopes distinguishes articular cartilage <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> from normal articular cartilage, we used seven monoclonal antibodies to examine normal articular cartilage and cartilage <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> from osteochondral defects 3. 2 mm {{in diameter and}} 4. 0 mm deep in the medial femoral condyles of 27 New Zealand white rabbits and seven cynomolgus monkeys. Following creation of the osteochondral defects, one limb of each animal was treated with cast immobilization while the other limb was treated with passive motion for two weeks. Rabbit knees were examined at eight (13 animals, 26 knees) and 36 weeks (14 animals, 28 knees) and monkey knees at eight weeks (seven animals, 14 knees) following surgery. Staining for six of the antibodies did not differ between repair cartilage and normal articular cartilage, but an antibody that recognizes atypical glycosaminoglycan structures in developing tissues (MAb 7 D 4) consistently distinguished repair cartilage from normal cartilage in rabbits and monkeys. <b>Repair</b> <b>tissue</b> consisting of hyaline toluidine blue-staining matrix containing chondrocytic cells uniformly showed strong 7 D 4 staining. In contrast, normal articular cartilage and fibrous <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> showed inconsistent weak 7 D 4 staining. At eight weeks following surgery, rabbit cartilage <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> stained more intensely for 7 D 4 than monkey cartilage repair tissue; in rabbits, cartilage <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> stained more intensely for 7 D 4 at eight weeks than at 36 weeks following surgery. <b>Repair</b> <b>tissue</b> staining for 7 D 4 did not differ between osteochondral defects treated with passive motion and those treated with immobilization in rabbits and monkeys. These results indicate that expression of {{a high level of}} proteoglycan epitope 7 D 4 distinguishes hyaline articular cartilage <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> from normal articular cartilage and fibrous cartilage <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> {{in the early stages of}} osteochondral healing, and that as hyaline articular cartilage <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> matures expression of 7 D 4 decreases.

25|$|Aragonite {{scaffolds}} {{have recently}} been shown to support the growth of neurons from rat hippocampi. Shany et al. (2006) proved that aragonite matrices can support the growth of astrocytic networks in vitro and in vivo. Thus, aragonite scaffolds may be useful for nerve <b>tissue</b> <b>repair</b> and regeneration. It is hypothesized that aragonite-derived Ca2+ is essential for promoting cell adherence and cell–cell contact. This is probably carried out through the help of Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules such as cadherins. Aragonite crystalline matrices have many advantages over hydrogels. They have larger pores, which allows for better cell growth, and the material is bioactive {{as a result of}} releasing Ca2+, which promotes cell adhesion and survival. In addition, the aragonite matrices have higher mechanical strength than hydrogels, allowing them to withstand more pressure when pressed into an injured tissue.|$|E
25|$|Regeneration among hydra {{occurs as}} foot {{regeneration}} {{arising from the}} basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region. Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and a foot in the basal end so that both regions {{are present in the}} newly regenerated organism. Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to <b>tissue</b> <b>repair.</b> In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct molecular cascades that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to differentiation. This early-injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, cell death, phagocytosis of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix.|$|E
25|$|Lp(a) is {{assembled}} at the hepatocyte {{cell membrane}} surface, while other scenarios exist {{with regard to}} the location of assembly. It mainly exists in plasma. Lp(a) contributes to the process of atherogenesis. Because of its structural similarity to plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, competitive inhibition leads to reduced fibrinolysis, {{and as a result of}} the stimulation of secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, Lp(a) leads to thrombogenesis. It may also enhance coagulation by inhibiting the function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Lp(a) carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids as a preferential carrier of oxidized phospholipids in human plasma, which attract inflammatory cells to vessel walls and leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, Lp(a) is also hypothesized to be involved in wound healing and <b>tissue</b> <b>repair,</b> interacting with components of the vascular wall and extra cellular matrix. Apo(a), a distinct feature of the Lp(a) particle, binds to immobilized fibronectin and endows Lp(a) with the serine-proteinase-type proteolytic activity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: to {{evaluate}} the ability of T 2 mapping on an 8. 5 T imager to characterize morphologically and quantitatively spontaneous repair of rat patellar cartilage following full thickness defect. Methods: Patellar cartilage defects were created in 24 rats knees on D 0. Eight rats per time-point were killed on D 20, D 40 and D 60 after surgery. T 2 maps of <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> in patellar defects were obtained from eight different axial spin echo images on an 8. 5 T imager. Global, superficial and deep T 2 values were evaluated in spontaneous <b>repair</b> <b>tissues</b> (3 × 8 right patellae) vs the opposite patellae (3 × 8 left patellae) of the same animals. MR data were compared with macroscopic and histological studies. Results: T 2 map was able to identify morphologically three types of <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> observed macroscopically and histologically: ‘total’, ‘partial’ and ‘hypertrophic’ <b>repair</b> <b>tissue.</b> ‘Total’ and ‘partial’ <b>repair</b> <b>tissues</b> were characterized by global T 2 values almost similar to controls, whereas ‘hypertrophic’ <b>repair</b> <b>tissues</b> were characterized by T 2 global values higher than controls. Zonal variation between superficial and deep T 2 values observed in controls was not depicted in <b>repair</b> <b>tissue</b> before D 60.

25|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} {{develops}} {{in more than}} 25% of people with A-T. Three major types of lung disease can develop: (1) recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections; (2) lung disease caused by ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired airway clearance; and (3) restrictive interstitial lung disease. It is common for individuals with A-T {{to have more than}} one of these lung conditions. Chronic lung disease can occur because of recurrent lung infections due to immunodeficiency. Individuals with this problem are at risk of developing bronchiectasis, a condition in which bronchial tubes are permanently damaged, resulting in recurrent lower airway infections. Gamma globulin for people with antibody deficiency and/or chronic antibiotic treatment may reduce the problems of infection. Other individuals with A-T have difficulty with taking deep breaths and may have an ineffective cough, making it difficult to clear oral and bronchial secretions. This can lead to prolonged respiratory symptoms following common viral respiratory illnesses. Techniques that allow clearance of mucus can be helpful in some individuals during respiratory illnesses. Some people will develop swallowing problems as they age, increasing their risk of aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent injury to the lungs caused by chronic infections or aspiration may cause lung fibrosis and scarring. This process may be enhanced by inadequate <b>tissue</b> <b>repair</b> in ATM-deficient cells. A small number of individuals develop interstitial lung disease. They have decreased pulmonary reserve, trouble breathing, a need for supplemental oxygen and chronic cough in the absence of lung infections. They may respond to systemic steroid treatment or other drugs to reduce inflammation.|$|E
