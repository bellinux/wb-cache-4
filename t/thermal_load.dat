40|$|The {{objective}} of the Mined Geologic Disposal System (MGDS) <b>Thermal</b> <b>Loading</b> Systems Study being conducted by the is to identify a thermal strategy that will meet the performance requirements for waste isolation and will be safe and licensable. Specifically, both postclosure and preclosure performance standards must be met by the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> strategy ultimately selected. In addition cost and schedule constraints must be considered. The Systems Engineering approach requires structured, detailed analyses that will ultimately provide the technical basis for the development, integration, and evaluation of the overall system, not just a subelement of that system. It is also necessary that the systems study construct options from within the range that are allowed within the current legislative and programmatic framework. For example {{the total amount of}} fuel that can legally be emplaced is no more than 70, 000 metric tons of uranium (MTU) which is composed of 63, 000 MTU spent fuel and 7, 000 MTU of defense high level waste. It is the intent of this study to begin the structured development of the basis for a <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> decision. However, it is recognized that {{to be able to make}} a final decision on <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> will require underground data on the effects of heating as well as a suite of ''validated'' models. It will be some time before these data and models are available to the program. Developing a final, <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> decision will, therefore, be an iterative process. In the interim, the {{objective of}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> systems study has been to utilize the information available to assess the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>loading.</b> Where technical justification exists, recommendations to narrow the range of <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> options can be made. Additionally, recommendations as to the type of testing and accuracy of the testing needed to establish the requisite information will be made. A constraint on the ability of the study to select an option stems from the lack of primary hard data, uncertainties in derived data, unsubstantiated models, and the inability to fully consider simultaneously coupled processes. As such, the study must rely on idealized models and available data to compare the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> options. This report presents the findings of the FY 1993 MGDS <b>Thermal</b> <b>Loading</b> Systems Study. The objectives of the study were to: (1) if justified, place bounds on the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> which would establish the loading that is ''too hot''; (2) ''grade'' or evaluate the performance as a function of <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> of the potential repository to contain high level spent nuclear fuel against performance criteria; (3) evaluate the performance of the various options with respect to cost, safety, and operability; and (4) recommend the additional types of tests and/or analyses to be conducted to provide the necessary information for a <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> selection...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} meet the overall {{performance}} requirements for the proposed Mined Geology Disposal System at Yucca Mountain, Nevada requires the two major subsystem (natural barriers and engineered barriers) to positively contribute to containment and radionuclide isolation. In addition to the postclosure performance the proposed repository must meet preclosure requirements of safety, retrievability, and operability. Cost and schedule were also considered. The <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> strategy chosen may significantly affect both the postclosure and preclosure performance of the proposed repository. Although the current Site Characterization Plan reference case is 57 kilowatts (kW) /acre, other <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> strategies (different areal mass loadings) have been proposed which possess both advantages and disadvantages. The objectives of the FY 1993 <b>Thermal</b> <b>Loading</b> Study were to (1) place bounds on the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> which would establish the loading regime that is ``too hot`` and the loading regime that is ``too cold``, to (2) ``grade`` or evaluate the performance, {{as a function of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>loading,</b> of the repository to contain high level wastes against performance criteria and to (3) evaluate the performance of the various options with respect to cost, safety, and operability.
