Accordingly, this paper explores the notion of cross-source integration of cloud-based, context-aware information in ubiquitous computing through a developed prototypical solution. Moreover, the described solution incorporates remote and automatic configuration of Android smartphones and advances the research area of context-aware information by harvesting information from several sources to build a rich foundation on which algorithms for context-aware computation can be based. Evaluation results show the viability of integrating and tailoring contextual information to provide users with timely, relevant and adapted application behaviour and content...|$|R
2500|$|The {{drawback}} {{of having}} juries rather than judges fix the penalty in capital cases {{is the risk}} {{that they will have}} no frame of reference for imposing the death penalty in a rational manner. Although this problem may not be totally correctible, the Court trusted that the guidance given the jury by the aggravating factors or other special-verdict questions would assist it in deciding on a sentence. The drafters of the Model Penal Code [...] "concluded that it is within <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> to point to the main circumstances of aggravation and mitigation that should be weighed and weighed against each other when they are presented in a concrete case." [...] For the Court, these factors adequately guarded against the risk of arbitrary imposition of the death sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{suggest that}} {{substantial}} Jewish immigration probably {{occurred during the}} Roman period of Hispania.

Exactly how soon after this time Jews made their way onto the scene in this context is a matter of speculation. It is within <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>possibility</b> that they went there under the Romans as free men to take advantage of its rich resources. The Jewish historian Josephus confirms that as early as 90 CE there was already a Jewish Diaspora living in Europe, made-up of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Thus, he writes in his Antiquities: [...] “…there are but two tribes in Asia (Turkey) and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now and are an immense multitude.” ...|$|E
