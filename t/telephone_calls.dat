5|$|The American Red Cross set up {{operations}} at the Crum drugstore and {{took the lead in}} providing aid and comfort to the victims.

5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E

An equivalent time service operated by the U.S. Naval Observatory can be accessed by calling +1-202-762-1401 (Washington, D.C.). <b>Telephone</b> <b>calls</b> are limited to two minutes in length, and the signal is delayed {{by an average of}} 30 milliseconds.|$|E
5|$|Less than 35minutes {{into the}} flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the {{passengers}}, crew, and pilots {{to the rear}} of the aircraft. Hani Hanjour, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.|$|E

5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
5|$|Because of his long-running {{television}} {{career and}} eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised {{and became a}} popular public figure. In 1976 {{it was used to}} good effect for an April Fools' Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event that meant that if listeners could jump at that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of weightlessness. The BBC received many <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation. He was a key figure in the establishment of the International Birdman event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN began {{promoting}} audience interaction {{early in}} its history, by the regular incorporation of viewer <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> in its programming. It has since expanded into social media. In March 2009, viewers began submitting questions live via Twitter to guests on C-SPAN's morning call-in show Washington Journal. The network {{also has a}} Facebook page to which it added occasional live streaming in January 2011. The live stream is intended to show selected well-publicized events of Congress. In June 2010, C-SPAN joined with the website Foursquare to provide users of the application with access to geotagged C-SPAN content at various locations in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional method of placing a <b>telephone</b> <b>call,</b> new technologies allow different methods for initiating a <b>telephone</b> <b>call,</b> such as voice dialing. Voice over IP technology allows calls to be made through a PC, using a service like Skype. [...] Other services, such as toll-free dial-around enable callers to initiate a <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> through a third party without exchanging phone numbers. Originally, no phone calls could be made without first talking to the Switchboard operator. Using 21st century mobile phones {{does not require the}} use of an operator to complete a phone call.|$|R

5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and <b>telephone</b> <b>calls.</b> The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft <b>telephone</b> <b>calls,</b> which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, CFMT-TV in Toronto {{broadcast}} Neighbours on weeknights at 11:00 pm, {{starting in}} September 1990. From 20 May 1991, CFMT moved {{the show to}} 4:00pm. After announcing its cancellation, CFMT decided to keep Neighbours on its schedule throughout September 1994, following numerous letters and <b>telephone</b> <b>calls.</b> From April 2017, Neighbours began airing on OutTV. Episodes are broadcast on weekdays at 2:30pm ET and 5:30pm ET, with an omnibus on Saturdays.

5|$|On 15 December, Suffolk Constabulary's website {{revealed}} that a total of 7,300 <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> {{had been made to}} police regarding the investigation, and that over 300 police staff and specialists were working on the cases, with support from at least 25 other police forces. As of 18 December, the number of officers involved in the investigation had increased to 650 including 350 officers from 40 other police forces who had assisted in the inquiry. The number of calls received regarding the case had also increased to around 10,000.|$|E

5|$|Selfridges {{was bombed}} again on 17 April 1941, {{suffering}} further damage, including {{the destruction of}} the Palm Court Restaurant. The basement was converted to a communications base, with a dedicated line run along Oxford Street to Whitehall, and allowed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to make secure and direct <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> to the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The store was damaged again on 6 December 1944 after a V2 rocket exploded on nearby Duke Street, causing its Christmas tree displays to collapse into the street outside. Damage was quickly repaired and the shop re-opened the following day.|$|E
5|$|Using mobile-phone {{tracking}} techniques, {{police were}} able to trace who had used cell phones near {{the scene of the}} disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries. The analysis turned up several <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> and texts between three men near the Ocean Club {{around the time of the}} disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E

5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E
