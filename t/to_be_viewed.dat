5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters {{in such a way}} as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.|$|E

The game's prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E
