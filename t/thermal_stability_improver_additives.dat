30|$|The {{following}} is a summary of many rheological studies on waxy crude oils {{in the presence of}} polymeric and surfactant DRAs. Popoola et al. (2015) studied the effect of triethanolamine (TEA) as a flow <b>improver</b> <b>additive</b> on Niger-Delta crude oil and investigated the rheological properties of the crude oil under nonisothermal conditions. They noted that the flow properties of the crude oil were influenced by the resins and asphaltenes present in the oil. They concluded that TEA is an effective flow <b>improver</b> <b>additive</b> for Niger-Delta crude oil and temperature variations have a direct effect on the crude oil viscosity.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} Cetane <b>Improver</b> <b>additives</b> {{manufactured}} today is 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (CAS n°: 27247-96-7) which starts to decompose at 130 °C. 2-ethylhexyl nitrate {{is the result of}} the reaction of 2-ethylhexanol and nitric acid.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{chemical}} composition, a Cetane <b>Improver</b> <b>additive</b> has {{the faculty}} to decompose itself at lower temperature than Diesel fuel.

Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual cetane number, and the cetane index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) cetane number. Cetane number should equal or exceed cetane index, depending on the amount of additive used. The most common additive is 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2EHN).|$|R

Significant correlations were found among first degree relatives, confirming the previously reported familial aggregation of TS PST basal {{activity and}} <b>thermal</b> <b>stability.</b> Commingling analysis of basal TS PST activity provided evidence for multiple component distributions, and after transformation to remove skewness, segregation analysis supported a major gene hypothesis. For TS PST <b>thermal</b> <b>stability,</b> commingling analysis also provided evidence for multiple component distributions. However, segregation analyses were equivocal {{with regard to}} the presence of a major gene for <b>thermal</b> <b>stability,</b> since support for a major gene model depended on skewness. Bivariate commingling analysis, which examined <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> by simultaneously considering basal activity and activity after heating, suggested that genotypes, as defined by the inferred component distributions for TS PST activity, differ in <b>thermal</b> <b>stability.</b> A three-allele model is proposed as one hypothesis that may account for the combined results of basal activity and <b>thermal</b> <b>stability.</b> The results {{of this study indicate that}} a major gene polymorphism in conjunction with polygenic inheritance plays an important role in the regulation of both level of activity and <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> of this important drug-metabolizing enzyme in humans...|$|R

The chemical composition of four wood species - Quercus alba, Pinus radiata, Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia cyclops - has been determined, as the species is expected to affect the <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> of wood. Subsequently, the hot-water (HW) extractives, ethanol/cyclohexane (E/C) extractives and both extractives were eliminated from the wood via Soxhlet extraction and the <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> of the wood determined with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under identical conditions. The results suggest that a higher cellulose and lignin content leads to better <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> of wood in different temperature regimes. In all cases, the removal of extractives improved the <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> of the wood. The effect of combined extractions was more pronounced than of an individual extraction and E/C-extraction caused less improvement in the <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> of wood than HW extraction. The degradation of the investigated wood extractives occurred at low rates over a broad temperature range.
