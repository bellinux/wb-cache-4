25|$|Several Deputies and {{high-ranking}} {{civil servants}} {{were of the}} opinion that Luxembourg could retain a measure of autonomy under the military administration, as had occurred in World War I, and attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> sort of arrangement with Germany. However, it was soon made clear by the authorities in Berlin that Luxembourg's fate would be very different this time. The Nazis considered the Luxembourgish people as just another Germanic ethnic group and the Grand Duchy a German territory. The military authorities had to leave Luxembourg by 31 July 1940, {{to be replaced by a}} civil administration under Gustav Simon.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-five {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave. The {{absence of the}} French element left practically only two contending parties—the young and the old. The former had secretly settled on Giovanni de' Medici; the second openly supported S. Giorgio, England's candidate. The Sacred College had been assembled almost {{a week before the}} first serious scrutiny took place. Many of the cardinals, wishing to temporise and conceal their real intentions, had voted for the man they considered least likely to have any supporters. As luck would have it, thirteen prelates had selected the same outsider, with the result that they all but elected Arborense, the most worthless nonentity present. This narrow shave gave the Sacred College such a shock that its members determined <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> agreement which would put matters on a more satisfactory basis for both parties.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{following}} {{the end of}} the series. Keith DeCandido reviewed [...] "Q Who" [...] for Tor.com, describing it as [...] "one of the best hours of TNG". He called de Lancie's performance a [...] "triumphant return", said that Goldberg brought [...] "mystery and depth" [...] to her role and that Stewart [...] "just kills" [...] as Picard. He said that the introduction of the Borg was [...] "phenomenal", and gave the episode a score of ten out of ten. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club said that the plot was [...] "brilliant" [...] because Q was proved right. He thought that had the crew been able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> sort of solution then {{it would have been a}} [...] "strong" [...] episode, but because Picard is forced to plead with Q, it made it the first [...] "great episode" [...] of the series because [...] "it admits that these humans... can be arrogant, and weak, and that they can be bested". He gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] grade.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the ranking}} and {{influential}} {{leaders of the}} Quraysh tried and failed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> arrangements with Muhammad in exchange for abandoning his preaching. They offered him admission into the inner circle of merchants and establishing his position in the circle by an advantageous marriage, but Muhammad refused. During this period, Muhammad urged his followers to be pacifist, commanding them to [...] "deal gently with the infidels".|$|E
2500|$|The Royal United Services Institute said in 2012 that an {{independent}} Scotland {{could set up}} a Scottish Defence Force, comparable in size and strength {{to those of other}} small European states like Denmark, Norway and Ireland, at an annual cost of £1.8 billion. The authors acknowledged that {{an independent}} Scotland would [...] "need <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> arrangement {{with the rest of the}} UK" [...] on intelligence-gathering, cyber-warfare and cyber-defence, that the future cost of purchasing and maintaining equipment of its forces might be higher due to smaller orders, and that recruitment and training [...] "may prove problematic" [...] in the early years.|$|E

2500|$|The United States treaty negotiators had overtly {{misrepresented}} {{the purpose}} and effect of the proposed treaty as merely conveying a [...] "right of passage" [...] over the Ojibwe lands to the United States. [...] The United States intention to bring in settlers {{as well as the}} railroad had been an established policy for years, as was plainly stated in newspapers and governmental reports of the time. [...] Governor Ramsey's journal of the treaty negotiations contained his speech to the assembled Ojibwe in which he, as a trained lawyer and experienced politician and Indian negotiator, directly misrepresented {{the purpose and}} intent of the treaty: Now, there is growing up a trade of considerable importance between the British settlements on the north and the American settlements on the south. ... Now, this is a trade which cannot and must not be interrupted. [...] And their Great Father, feeling this, and desirous to prevent any trouble between his white and red people, has sent us here <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> understanding with you about it. [...] Their Great Father has no especial desire to get possession of their lands. [...] He does not want their lands at all if {{they do not want to}} part with them. [...] He has more land now than he knows what to do with. [...] He simply wishes that his people should enjoy the privilege of traveling through their country on steamboats and wagons unmolested Even after the initial proposal for a mere right of way was rejected, he was representing that if they sold their land, the Ojibwe could still occupy it and hunt on it for a long time.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Wingfield had entered, and {{his manner}} was very {{different}} {{to that of the}} secretary.

60|$|She spoke very softly, almost {{under her}} breath, {{and when she}} had {{finished}} there seemed everywhere a strange emptiness of sound.

40|$|An {{economic}} theory of knowledge {{makes sense of}} much of the phenomenon of religious belief as merely a form of knowledge.

2500|$|Considering himself [...] "the first {{servant of}} the state", Frederick was a proponent of enlightened absolutism.
