25|$|Casualty {{rates were}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> sign of this disaster. Already, {{by the end}} of 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained {{recruits}} had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the troops in 1917.|$|E
25|$|The Laas Geel cave {{paintings}} {{are thought to}} be some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> rock art in Africa. Among other things, they depict cattle in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans, who are believed to have been inhabitants of the region. The necks of the cattle are embellished with a kind of plastron. Some of the cattle are also portrayed wearing decorative robes. Besides long-horned cattle, the rock art also shows an image of a domesticated dog, several paintings of canidae as well as a giraffe. The site is excellently preserved due to the location of the paintings which are covered by the granite overhangs.|$|E
25|$|The Black Death ravaged Ireland 1348–49. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> {{accounts}} of the plague was written by Friar John Clyn at Kilkenny, who thought that all mankind might die. He reports that particularly in the months of September and October, 1348, people came from all over Ireland to St. Mullins, County Carlow, including many no doubt from County Wexford, out of fear, to seek divine protection from the 'pestilence' {{as he calls it}} – as it was then very prevalent. He comments on how it was rare for only one member of a family to die, but that usually the entire family was wiped out. John Clyn himself is believed to have died in 1349 from the plague.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} Soviet times Russia has {{experienced}} another wave of Western cultural influence, {{which led to}} the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> example, perhaps, is the Russian rock music, which takes its roots both in the Western rock and roll and heavy metal, and in traditions of the Russian bards of Soviet era, like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Saint-Petersburg (former Leningrad), Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) and Omsk became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include Mashina Vremeni, Slot, DDT, Aquarium, Alisa, Kino, Nautilus Pompilius, Aria, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Splean and Korol i Shut. At the same time Russian pop music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as estrada into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like t.A.T.u. in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or Vitas in China.|$|E

An early American environmentalist named Gifford Pinchot said of the Everglades, [...] "It is a region so different that it hardly seems to belong to the United States.

500|$|Among Waters' Victorian-set novels, {{depictions of}} sexual {{encounters}} are also, according to Palmer, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> in Tipping the Velvet. A review in The Advocate calls the book [...] "riotously sexy", and The Seattle Times suggests {{the scene where}} Nan shows Kitty how to open and eat an oyster is evocative of Tom Jones. This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians. Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour, or employed it as an erotic element controlled by, and for the benefit of, men. Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes, [...] "Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal stereotype of the lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed. It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or under the covers. We don’t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Preface of [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] {{began by}} {{explaining}} {{that it was}} printed [...] "at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity, {{and as far as}} the author's own opinions are concerned, rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed poetic merits". The preface then provided an origin to both the poem and why it was merely a smaller portion of an intended larger work. After reading from Purchas's book, [...] "The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two or three hundred lines ... On Awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved." [...] The image of himself that Coleridge provides is of a dreamer who reads works of lore and not as an opium addict. Instead, the effects of the opium, as described, are intended to suggest that he was not used to its effects.|$|E

On awakening he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved. At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour, and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone had been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration of the latter: ...|$|E

5000|$|Michael Brooke of Sight & Sound commented, [...] "Although it’s {{easy to see}} why it was pigeonholed as {{a horror}} film, its first half {{presents}} what is still one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> viscerally <b>vivid</b> portraits of a disintegrating relationship yet committed to film, comfortably rivalling Lars von Trier’s Antichrist, David Cronenberg’s The Brood and Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage." [...] Reviewing the Blu-ray release of the movie in 2013 Michael Dodd of Bring The Noise UK was similarly impressed with what he called [...] "an intense exploration of marital breakdown".

5000|$|For most of {{his artistic}} life Chetkov painted in {{isolation}} as his work did not conform with Communist-approved Socialist Realism. However, despite difficult early experiences and an almost total lack of recognition, he never lost his [...] "irrepressible strength of spirit", and it comes across in his paintings, which are for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part <b>vivid</b> in palette and vital in execution. He returned to certain genres again and again: still life, landscape, equine art, abstract expressionism, portraiture and music, continuously experimenting with new colour palettes and media. Chetkov was also influenced by nostalgia for his early childhood experiences on his grandfather's farm, frequently harking back to an idealised, pre-Stalin version of country life in glass works and in his genre and landscape paintings.|$|R
