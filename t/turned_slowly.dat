25|$|As {{the ship}} <b>turned</b> <b>slowly</b> to comb torpedoes, two sticks of bombs fell {{on either side}} of the tanker. The vessel lifted, and went on lifting until she was clean out of the water. Cascades of spray and bomb {{splinters}} lashed the deck, she fell back with a crash. Ohio had differential gearing which slowed the propeller automatically; on other ships, the same effect would have shaken the engines out of their rooms. Continuously bombed, the tanker kept on steaming until another explosion to starboard sent her reeling to port. The engine-room lights went out, plunging her into darkness. The master switches had been thrown off by the force of the explosion, but they were quickly switched on again by an electrician. This time, the ship had not escaped damage. The boiler fires were blown out, and it was a race against time to restore them before the steam pressure dropped too low to work the fuel pumps. The engineers lit the fire starter torches to restart the furnaces.|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{was drawn}} to this story because {{he spent much of}} his {{childhood}} in San Anselmo in Marin County during the initial Zodiac murders. [...] "I remember coming home and saying the highway patrol had been following our school buses for a couple weeks now. [...] And my dad, who worked from home, and who was very dry, not one to soft-pedal things, <b>turned</b> <b>slowly</b> in his chair and said: 'Oh yeah. There's a serial killer who has killed four or five people, who calls himself Zodiac, who's threatened to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tires of a school bus, and then shoot the children as they come off the bus. For Fincher as a young boy, the killer [...] "was the ultimate boogeyman". The director was also drawn to the unresolved ending of Vanderbilt's screenplay because it felt true to real life, as cases are not always solved. Toschi later stated that he had watched Zodiac several times and added [...] "I thought Ruffalo did a good job," [...] but also reported that the film reminded him of old frustrations that the case was never closed.|$|E
