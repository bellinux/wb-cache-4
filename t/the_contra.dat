5|$|Violeta Barrios Torres de Chamorro (born 18 October 1929) is a Nicaraguan politician, former {{president}} and publisher, known for ending <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> War, {{the final chapter}} of the Nicaraguan Revolution, and bringing peace to the country. She was the first and, to date, only woman to hold the position of president in Nicaragua.|$|E
50|$|Fearing that Communists {{would take}} over the Central American nation of Nicaragua if it {{remained}} {{under the leadership of}} the left-wing Sandinistas, the Reagan administration authorized CIA Director William J. Casey to arm <b>the</b> right-wing <b>Contras</b> early in his tenure. Congress, which favored negotiations between <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> and Sandinista, passed the 1982 Boland Amendment, prohibiting the CIA and Defense Department from using their budgets to aid to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Still intent on supporting <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> <b>the</b> Reagan administration raised funds for <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> from private donors and foreign governments.|$|R
25|$|During {{their war}} against the Nicaraguan government, <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> {{committed}} {{a large number of}} human rights violations and used terrorist tactics, carrying out more than 1300 terrorist attacks. These actions were frequently carried out systematically {{as a part of the}} strategy of <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> tried to downplay these violations, particularly the Reagan administration in the US, which engaged in a campaign of white propaganda to alter public opinion in favor of <b>the</b> <b>contras.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{front of}} the International Court of Justice, Nicaragua claimed that <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> were {{altogether}} a creation of the U.S. This claim was rejected. However, the evidence of a very close relationship between <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> and <b>the</b> United States was considered overwhelming and incontrovertible. The U.S. played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> over a long period, and <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> only became capable of carrying out significant military operations {{as a result of}} this support.|$|R
5|$|Since 2008 the {{district}} has been adding Library-a-Go-Go book vending machines. <b>The</b> <b>Contra</b> Costa County Library machine {{was added to the}} Pittsburg/Bay Point station in 2008. The $100,000 machine, imported from Sweden, was the first in the nation and was followed by one at the El Cerrito del Norte station in 2009. Later in 2011 a Peninsula Library System machine was added at the Millbrae Station.|$|E
5|$|The chapel's organ has 7,897 {{pipes in}} 135 ranks and 109 stops. It was {{designed}} by Ernest M. Skinner and installed in 1928.

In 1990 the organ was dismantled and shipped to England for a major restoration by Mander Organs. Thomas Trotter gave the re-opening recital on the restored organ in 1992.|$|E
5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 the Nicaraguan {{government}} filed a suit in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{against the}} United States. Nicaragua stated that <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> were completely created and {{managed by the}} U.S. Although this claim was rejected, the court found overwhelming and undeniable evidence of a very close relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> and <b>the</b> United States. The U.S. {{was found to have}} had a very large role in providing financial support, training, weapons, and other logistical support to <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> over a lengthy period of time, and that this support was essential to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beyond restricting overt U.S. {{support of}} <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> <b>the</b> most {{significant}} effect of the Boland Amendment was the Iran-Contra affair, during which the Reagan Administration circumvented the Amendment, without consent of Congress, {{in order to continue}} supplying arms to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{addition}} to the mandate, after discussions between the Government of Nicaragua and <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> included <b>the</b> proposal to create five [...] "security zones" [...] within Nicaragua within which <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> would demobilise.|$|R
5|$|In 1986, the Iran–Contra affair {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{acted as}} a conduit for U.S. support to <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> militants in Nicaragua for many years, {{including}} funds and weapons. He allowed the CIA to establish listening posts in Panama, and also helped the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government against the leftist Salvadoran insurgent Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front. U.S. spy ships used bases in Panama in their operations against the Nicaraguan government, {{and much of the}} intelligence gathered by these ships was processed in the U.S. bases in Panama. Noriega permitted these activities despite the Panama Canal treaties restricting the use of the U.S. bases to protecting the canal.|$|E
5|$|The bungee jump {{was filmed}} at <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> Dam (also {{known as the}} Verzasca or Locarno Dam) in Ticino, Switzerland. The film's casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter's {{demonstration}} were shot in Monte Carlo. Reference footage for the tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to the studio at Leavesden. The climactic scenes on the satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The actual MI6 headquarters were used for external views of M's office. Some of the scenes in St. Petersburg were actually shot in London – the Epsom Downs Racecourse doubled as the airport – to reduce expenses and security concerns, as the second unit sent to Russia required bodyguards.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the case}} for support of <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> {{continued}} {{to be made in}} Washington, D.C., by both the Reagan administration and The Heritage Foundation, which argued that support for <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> would counter Soviet influence in Nicaragua.|$|R
25|$|In August 1989, {{the month}} that campaigning began, <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> redeployed 8,000 troops into Nicaragua, after a funding boost from Washington, {{continued}} their guerrilla war. 50 FSLN candidates were assassinated. <b>The</b> <b>Contras</b> also distributed thousands of UNO leaflets.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Contras</b> were a counter-revolutionary militia {{formed in}} 1979 to oppose Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The Catholic Institute for International Relations {{asserted}} <b>the</b> following about <b>contra</b> operating procedures in 1987: [...] "The record of <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> in <b>the</b> field... {{is one of}} consistent and bloody abuse of human rights, of murder, torture, mutilation, rape, arson, destruction and kidnapping." [...] Americas Watchsubsequently folded into Human Rights Watchaccused <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> of targeting health care clinics and health care workers for assassination; kidnapping civilians, torturing civilians; executing civilians, including children, who were captured in combat; raping women; indiscriminately attacking civilians and civilian houses; seizing civilian property; and burning civilian houses in captured towns. <b>The</b> <b>contras</b> disbanded after <b>the</b> election of Violetta Chamorro in 1990.|$|R
5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{started on}} 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June. The producers {{were unable to}} use Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, {{because it had been}} reserved for First Knight, so an old Rolls-Royce factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio. In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter. The pre-credits sequence involved a bungee jump, which was filmed at <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont. Scenes on a satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, while in the UK, Epsom Downs Racecourse and the Nene Valley Railway were both used. For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya, and other effects, Derek Meddings built a number of miniature sets at Leavesden. Meddings had worked on the Bond films since Live and Let Die and died before the film's release; GoldenEye was dedicated to his memory.|$|E

5000|$|Released on April 13, 1989, the Kerry Committee {{report found}} that the U.S. State Department had {{assisted}} drug traffickers: [...] "who provided support for <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> were involved in drug trafficking … and elements of <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> themselves knowingly received financial and material assistance from drug traffickers." [...] Some of these payments were after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges or while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies. [...] The report declared, [...] "It is clear that individuals who provided support for <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> were involved in drug trafficking … and elements of <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> themselves knowingly received financial and material assistance from drug traffickers." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Contras</b> {{also carried}} out a {{systematic}} campaign to disrupt the social reform programs of the government. This campaign included attacks on schools, health centers {{and the majority of}} the rural population that was sympathetic to the Sandinistas. Widespread murder, rape, and torture were also used as tools to destabilize the government and to [...] "terrorize" [...] the population into collaborating with <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Throughout this campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> received military and financial support from the CIA and the Reagan Administration. [...] This campaign has been condemned internationally for its many human rights violations. Contra supporters have often tried to downplay these violations, or countered that the Sandinista government carried out much more. In particular, the Reagan administration engaged in a campaign to alter public opinion on <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> that has been termed [...] "white propaganda". In 1984, the International Court of Justice judged that the United States Government had been in violation of International law when it supported <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b>|$|R
50|$|North {{came into}} the public {{spotlight}} {{as a result of}} his participation in the Iran-Contra affair, a political scandal during the Reagan administration, in which he claimed partial responsibility for the sale of weapons through intermediaries to Iran, with the profits being channeled to <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> in Nicaragua. It was alleged that he was responsible for the establishment of a covert network which subsequently funneled those funds to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Congress passed <b>the</b> Boland Amendment (to the House Appropriations Bill of 1982 and following years), which prohibited the appropriation of U.S. funds by intelligence agencies for the support of <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> <b>The</b> money was passed through a shell organization, the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, to the Palmer National Bank of Washington, D.C., and then to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{opposition}} militias {{were initially}} organized and largely remained segregated according to regional affiliation and political backgrounds. They conducted attacks on economic, military, and civilian targets. During <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> war, the Sandinistas arrested suspected members of <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> militias and censored publications they accused of {{collaborating with the}} enemy (i.e. the U.S., the FDN, and ARDE, among others).|$|E

25|$|The Reagan administration's {{support for}} <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> {{continued}} to stir controversy {{well into the}} 1990s. In August 1996, San Jose Mercury News reporter Gary Webb published a series titled Dark Alliance, alleging that <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> contributed to <b>the</b> rise of crack cocaine in California.|$|R
25|$|By 1986 <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> were {{besieged by}} charges of corruption, human-rights abuses, and {{military}} ineptitude. A much-vaunted early 1986 offensive never materialized, and Contra forces were largely reduced to isolated acts of terrorism. In October 1987, however, <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> staged a successful attack in southern Nicaragua. Then on 21 December 1987, the FDN launched attacks at La Bonanza, La Siuna, and La Rosita in Zelaya province, resulting in heavy fighting. ARDE Frente Sur attacked at El Almendro {{and along the}} Rama road. These large-scale raids mainly became possible as <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> {{were able to use}} U.S.-provided Redeye missiles against Sandinista Mi-24 helicopter gunships, which had been supplied by the Soviets. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> remained tenuously encamped within Honduras and weren't able to hold Nicaraguan territory.|$|R
50|$|In early 1990 <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> {{were showing}} {{considerable}} reluctance to disband. This {{was due in}} part to the lack of control on the part of <b>the</b> fragmented <b>Contra</b> leadership, as well as the very real fears among <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> that if they disbanded and gave up their weapons they would be at the mercy of the Sandinista military. Although diplomats on all sides pressured <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> <b>the</b> hard line being taken on <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> was undermined by the reality that 260 unarmed UN observers were not going to force <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> to do anything. And so, setting aside their historical aversion to peace-enforcement, the Security Council decided to expand ONUCA's mandate and temporarily give it some combat power: a battalion of paratroopers with their basic weapons. On 15 March 1990 the UN Secretary-General asked the Security Council, on an urgent basis, that ONUCA be expanded from its 260 observers to add 116 more for observation plus an armed infantry battalion of at least four rifle companies (about 800 troops) for supervision of Contra demobilization. Venezuela, which already was providing observers to ONUCA, had agreed to provide this battalion. Although the Secretary-General's Report did not say that the demobilization would be forced, there was a clear implication that adding armed paratroopers to the unarmed UN military observers would be a powerful message to <b>the</b> reluctant <b>Contras.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Commander Carrion {{testified that}} the ability of <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> to carry out {{military}} operations was completely dependent upon United States funding, training and logistical support. Carrion [...] stated that the U.S. Government supplied <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> with uniforms, weapons, communications equipment, intelligence, training, and coordination in using this material aid.|$|R
25|$|In 1982, {{legislation}} was enacted by US Congress to prohibit further direct aid to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Reagan's officials attempted to illegally supply {{them out of}} the proceeds of arms sales to Iran and third party donations, triggering the Iran-Contra Affair of 1986–87. Mutual exhaustion, Sandinista fears of Contra unity and military success, and mediation by other regional governments led to the Sapoa ceasefire between the Sandinistas and <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> on March 23, 1988. Subsequent agreements were designed to reintegrate <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> and their supporters into Nicaraguan society in preparation for general elections.|$|R
25|$|Commander Carrion {{began by}} {{explaining}} {{the condition of}} <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> prior to United States' aid in December 1981.
