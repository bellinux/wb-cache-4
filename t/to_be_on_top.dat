25|$|Indeed, Sri Lanka's first Test matches were promising, {{but in the}} end {{it often}} ran away from them at crucial moments. An example of this would be Dias' third Test, which was the second Test of three in Pakistan. Batting first, Sidath Wettimuny and Dias added 217 for the second wicket, then a Sri Lankan record {{partnership}} for any wicket. That enabled Sri Lanka <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> leading by 184 on first innings, but they could not bowl out Pakistan and had to settle for a draw. Sri Lanka went on to lose the series 0–2, despite Dias recording a career best 109 in the Third Test.|$|E

Regan continued, [...] "She knows that <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin." [...] After Carter defeats Underwood and Leviathan in the first season, Underwood becomes [...] "a lone wolf ... she’s a woman without a country right now, but she is more involved in the [...] case" [...] for the second season than it initially appears.|$|E

The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and forth on the 59th Street Bridge.|$|E
500|$|Recording of Satisfied {{began in}} September 2007 at Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. [...] As with DecembeRadio's {{previous}} album, Scotty Wilbanks {{was hired as}} the producer. [...] Said Reedy of Wilbanks, [...] "We just have a kindredship as musicians and as players.... There's {{a lot of excitement}} and passion that comes from his end.... big thing for us is having a really good time. [...] If we're not having a good time making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of his game and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music that you really can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E
500|$|However, Auerbach {{could not}} prevent the Celtics from {{going into a}} slump {{at the end of}} the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary {{increases}} that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. [...] While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family. Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, [...] "I'm not going anywhere. [...] We're going to sign Larry Bird, and we're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> again." [...] Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.|$|E

2500|$|Henry is {{presented}} as a good man, but a poor king, to whom Roger Warren refers as [...] "a man of deep religious conviction but no political acumen."

As director Peter Hall says, [...] "In theory, Henry should be a good king. He applies Christian ethics to government. But he is up against men who don't. They justify their behaviour by invoking the great sanctions – God, the King, Parliament, the People – that unscrupulous statesmen, motivated by the naked desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> have used throughout the ages.

Barton and Hall were insistent there be no direct references to contemporary events in the production itself; [...] "instead, contemporary issues were used to help the company explore the political and psychological meanings of the plays." [...] The plays were approached as a collective analysis of power, with the behaviour of unscrupulous politicians contrasted with the political innocence and religious idealism of Henry.

Similarly, Crockett's perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear {{a small amount of}} beard stubble, also known as a five o'clock shadow (or [...] "designer stubble") at all times.
