25|$|Clarett's time at Ohio State University {{was marked}} by several troubling incidents. He was seen yelling at his {{position}} coach during the Northwestern–Ohio State game in the 2002 season. In December 2002, he publicly maligned OSU officials for not paying for him to fly home for the funeral of a friend and accused administrators of lying when <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had not filed the necessary paperwork. In July 2003, Clarett {{became the center of}} an academic scandal when a teaching assistant told the New York Times that Clarett had received preferential treatment from professors, claiming he had not attended any classes during his only year at Ohio State. However, the investigation did not find sufficient evidence of academic misconduct.|$|E

He was elected member of the Michigan State Senate 22nd District for 1893–94 again under the Fusion ticket, and as Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative from Michigan 8th District in 1900. [...] "In the capitol at Lansing", one Saginaw News account read, [...] "Sen. Burt was more conspicuous for his political naiveté than for any distinguished act of statesmanship. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> tried hard, but to him, politics were strange shenanigans.

500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant and that Mr. Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have him go to schools to talk to the children. The cast really liked Tom Jones as a guest star. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was fun to work with, and was really nice, and even offered to perform a concert after he was done recording lines.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Excursions In and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840, the {{geologist}} Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's water dog. [...] "A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal {{was of a}} breed {{very different from what}} we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth." [...] wrote Jukes. [...] "These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot was white, and Harvey said he did it to [...] "toil" [...] or entice the fish. The whole proceeding struck me as remarkable, more especially as <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had never been taught anything of the kind." ...|$|E
500|$|When McClure refused, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would soon}} notice {{a loss of}} advertising. The church {{purchased}} the manuscript when the book appeared, and there were rumors that the plates had been destroyed. In June 1920 it also purchased some of McClure's research files from a New York manuscript dealer, including notes from Milmine and drafts of the book handwritten by Cather. Christian Scientists {{were reported to have}} bought and destroyed copies of the book, and removed them from libraries. Sergeant wrote in 1953 that the book [...] "disappeared almost immediately from circulation—the Christian Scientists are said to have bought the copies". It had become scarce even in libraries. According to Sergeant, readers in the 1950s were likely to have to borrow it from the chief librarian and be watched while reading it. The book's copyright expired 28 years after publication. Baker Book House, a Christian publishing house, republished it in 1971 [...] "in the interest of fairness and objectivity", according to its back cover.|$|E

500|$|Political ideologues {{took issue}} with Ray's work. In a public debate during the 1960s, Ray and the Marxist filmmaker Mrinal Sen engaged in an argument. Sen criticised him for casting a matinée idol such as Uttam Kumar, whom he {{considered}} a compromise. Ray said that Sen only attacked [...] "easy targets", i.e. the Bengali middle-classes. However Ray himself has made movies on Bengali middle class in films like Pratidwandi and Jana Aranya set {{during the period of}} the naxalite movement in Bengal. Advocates of socialism said that Ray was not [...] "committed" [...] to the cause of the nation's downtrodden classes; some critics accused him of glorifying poverty in Pather Panchali and Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder) through lyricism and aesthetics. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> provided no solution to conflicts in the stories, and was unable to overcome his bourgeois background. During the naxalite movements in the 1970s, agitators once came close to causing physical harm to his son, Sandip. Early in 1980, Ray was criticised by an Indian M.P. and former actress Nargis Dutt, who accused Ray of [...] "exporting poverty." [...] She wanted him to make films to represent [...] "Modern India." ...|$|E

In July 2010, she placed Miles second on her list of best soap characters. She spoke about how [...] "ridiculous storylines" [...] {{turn out to}} be great onscreen and referred to Miles's visions of Rabbit, which she went on to praise. She said [...] "Miles's grief, his visions of Rabbit and his torment at everyone telling him she wasn't real were devastating to watch, and this was a really interesting avenue to take one of the soap's best-loved characters down that could have spectacularly backfired, but instead, had people bawling their eyes out." [...] Holy Soap have said that Miles's most memorable moment is [...] "When he found student Trey trying to kiss Kirsty, Miles pushed him and found his job as a teacher in jeopardy". The website also named Miles as one their Summer Bay hunks.

500|$|Horch, who had {{remained}} a devoted follower of the Roeriches since his acceptance of their spiritual quest {{as his own}} in 1923, [...] started to fall out with them for unclear reasons. The Roeriches maintained that Horch's motives were base: through guile and deception <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had taken control of the Master Building, closed the cultural institutions it contained, and severed them and their associated from everything connected with the building and its contents. Horch countered that the Roeriches had improperly attempted to countermand his decisions as building owner {{and director of the}} cultural organizations it contained. He said they had shown bad faith when they asserted that they alone could receive and interpret the commands of the supreme being whom they all worshiped. On June 8, 1935, he wrote Helena Roerich to say he feared that the Roeriches had lost confidence in himself and his wife Nettie. Then, on July 13, 1935, Nettie wrote Helena of her and Horch's [...] "fourteen years of complete devotion in heart and in deed" [...] and of their enduring [...] "loyalty and selfless sacrifice" [...] over that period. She reaffirmed their [...] "flaming devotion" [...] which they continued to hold in their hearts. And she said the Roeriches' attempt to exert unilateral control over their affairs had caused them to [...] "contemplate, review and think of matters in a new light." [...] These letters explain actions that Horch took on June 5, 1936, to sever relations between the Institute and the other cultural organizations housed at the Master Building and discharge all their employees. The employees who occupied rent-free apartments were told to vacate immediately.|$|E
