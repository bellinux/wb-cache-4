5|$|After {{serving as}} the most {{influential}} policymaking body of the dynasty for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> the Deliberative Council was displaced and then made obsolete by the more ethnically mixed Grand Council, which the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) created in the late 1720s to circumvent {{the influence of the}} deliberative princes and ministers.

5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional.

5|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{astronomy}} {{has been the}} identification of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would provide useful constraints on supernova models. As of 2006, the search for such a progenitor had been ongoing for longer <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> Observation of the supernova SN 2011fe has provided useful constraints. Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope did not show a star at {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant as the source. The expanding plasma from the explosion was found to contain carbon and oxygen, making it likely the progenitor was a white dwarf primarily composed of these elements.|$|E
5|$|Family {{members of}} the Omiš branch were known for piracy in the Adriatic Sea, clashes with Venice, and were even accused of Patarene heresy.

5|$|Gilbert Charles Stuart (born Stewart; December 3, 1755– July 9, 1828) was an American painter from Rhode Island who {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of America's foremost portraitists.

Stuart retained the portrait and used it to paint 130 copies which he sold for $100 each.

5|$|Oswald {{was the son}} of Æthelfrith of Bernicia {{and came}} to rule after {{spending}} a period in exile. After defeating the British ruler Cadwallon ap Cadfan, Oswald brought the two Northumbrian kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira once again under a single ruler, and promoted the spread of Christianity in Northumbria. He was given a strongly positive assessment by the historian Bede, writing a little less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> after Oswald's death, who regarded Oswald as a saintly king; it is also Bede who is the main source for present-day historical knowledge of Oswald. After eight years of rule, in which he was the most powerful ruler in Britain, Oswald was killed in the Battle of Maserfield.|$|E

Plumlee also enjoyed camping, fishing, genealogy, and traveling.|$|E

5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared an intense rivalry as cities. For more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and {{economic}} power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E

They were promoted to the top flight in 1923, when they were also losing finalists in the first FA Cup Final held at Wembley. In 1940, the club won the inaugural Football League War Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of {{considerable}} debate for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> In 1920, British palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was {{an early version of}} the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.|$|E
