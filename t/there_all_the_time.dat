500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being <b>there</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} this visit, while {{on a trip to}} Las Vegas, that Priscilla first took amphetamines and {{sleeping}} pills to keep up with Elvis's lifestyle. After another visit at Christmas, Priscilla's parents finally let her move to Graceland for good in March 1963. Part of the agreement was that she would attend an all-girls Catholic school, the Immaculate Conception High School in Memphis, Tennessee, and live with Elvis's father and his stepmother in a separate house adjacent to the Graceland estate until she {{graduated from high school in}} June 1963. Part of the agreement also was that they would eventually marry. After a few weeks, however, she was moved into Graceland to be with Elvis, although her parents did eventually agree to her living there if Elvis promised to marry her. Priscilla later said, [...] "The move was natural. I was <b>there</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, the five-year-old Duan's Buddhist parents, still {{worried about}} his health, {{took him to the}} 1,500-year-old Shaolin Temple, the only remains of which after {{repeated}} destruction by warring dynasties and the current government were the foundation and some walls. (The temple as it is known today was reconstructed {{around the turn of the}} 21st century.) As this was in the middle of the Cultural Revolution, the familiar red and yellow robes and shaved heads were also not present among the monks, and would not be until approximately 1980, after the Cultural Revolution ended. Since there had not been an abbot at the temple in about 300 years, Duan was taken to the head monk, Shi Xing Zheng (who would later be appointed abbot in 1986). Shi Xing Zheng, whom Duan addressed as [...] "Shigong" [...] ("Grandmaster") or [...] "Shifu Shifu" [...] ("master's master"), looked at the young Duan and accepted him into the temple, where his parents were happy to leave him. As soon as he was accepted in the temple, which was populated by about 16 or 17 monks, all of them older than Duan (most of them in their seventies), his name was changed to Shi Yan Ming. The name is derived from [...] "Shi", as in Shakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, a family name that Buddhist monks of this tradition take in order to denote that they follow Buddha, [...] "Yan", which denotes the [...] "34th generation" [...] at the Shaolin Temple, and [...] "Ming", which means [...] "perpetual", as in the infinite cycle of the Dharma wheel. Shi says that his [...] "kung fu uncles" [...] at the temple were very loving, and took care of him as his own parents would, though they did not live <b>there</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> for fear of marauding gangs of Mao's Red Guard, and therefore, Shi saw his parents often.|$|E

500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as he bends {{down to pick up}} the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at <b>all.</b> <b>There</b> was <b>time</b> now. <b>There</b> was—was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!"

5000|$|Bleicher {{was moved}} to the Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp in October 1938 and remained <b>there</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> till national military defeat delivered liberation in May 1945. He was placed in [...] "Block 37" [...] with other [...] "political detainees", learning early on about the chicanery and ill-treatment to be expected from the guards, although he also learned how to exploit the corrupt ones in order to smuggle in supplies. Bleicher {{became a member of the}} resistance group inside the camp and worked increasingly with other inmates who had been fellow members of the KPD-O, notably Ludwig Becker, Eugen Ochs und Robert Siewert.|$|R

6000|$|... "There I join {{issue with}} you, sir," [...] the Frenchman replied. [...] "These are the obvious and {{expressed}} views of other European countries, yet month by month come rumours {{of the training}} of great masses of troops, far {{in excess of the}} numbers permitted by the League of Nations. <b>There</b> is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> a haze of secrecy over {{what is going on in}} certain parts of Germany. And as for Russia, ostensibly the freest country in the world, Tsarism in its worst days never imposed such despotic restrictions concerning the coming and going of foreigners, in one particular district, at any rate." ...|$|R
2500|$|At times, Lyne's {{directing}} {{took its}} toll on the cast and crew. In a scene taking place in an office, the director pumped it full of smoke, an effect that [...] "makes the colors less contrasty, more muted". According to Biziou, [...] "The texture it gives helps differentiate and separate various density levels of darkness farther back in frame". The smoke was piped in for 18 to 20 {{hours a day and}} Gere remembers, [...] "Our throats were being blown out. We had a special doctor who was <b>there</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> who was shooting people up with antibiotics for bronchial infections". Lane acquired an oxygen bottle in order to survive the rigorous schedule.|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} the child, however, and his {{development}} on his two planes of consciousness. <b>There</b> is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> a direct dynamic connection between child and mother, child and father also, from the start. It is a connection on two planes, the upper and lower. From the lower sympathetic center the profound intake of love or vibration from the living co-respondent outside. From the upper sympathetic center the outgoing of devotion and the passionate vibration of given love, given attention. The two sympathetic centers are always, or should always be, counterbalanced by their corresponding voluntary centers. From the great voluntary ganglion of the lower plane, the child is self-willed, independent, and masterful.|$|R

60|$|He went forth again furious, {{and wandered}} in <b>the</b> town <b>all</b> day.

6000|$|... "Why, {{it appears}} to be good, when it really is not so. Reasoning very often appears to be good, while <b>there</b> is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> some latent flaw in it which makes the {{conclusion}} wrong. Very often something is left out of the account which ought to be taken in and calculated for, and that is the case here. The truth is, that the current helps the steamer in going down just as much as it retards her in coming up for any given time; as for instance, for an hour, or for six hours. But we are to consider that in accomplishing any given distance, the steamer is longer in coming up than she is in going down, and so is exposed to the retarding effect of the current longer than she has the benefit of its coöperation.|$|R
5000|$|During {{their peak}} touring years the Olson Sisters, who then lived in Chicago, {{had a home}} away from home at Mrs. Dikka Koren's {{boarding}} house in Minneapolis. Other notable Norwegian-Americans also stayed there such as J. A. O. Preus, who was a future governor of Minnesota, and Herbjørn Gausta. Agnes Preus, Mrs. Koren's niece, recalls that the boarders were a convivial group: [...] "At the dinner table <b>there</b> were stories <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> I can remember it was hard to eat a meal because we spent so much time laughing." ...|$|R

[...] Nevertheless he was so shocked and indignant at being confronted in his own suppressions and falsehoods by an even greater and more astounding misconception of fact, {{that for a moment}} he felt helpless. What, he reflected, if it were alleged that 'Lige had returned again after the loafers had gone, or had never left the store as had been said? Nonsense! There was John Milton, who had been <b>there</b> reading <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and who could disprove it.

40|$|The sliding mode {{control and}} {{optimization}} are investigated for a class of nonlinear neutral systems with the unmatched nonlinear term.

60|$|He forgot, perhaps, {{that this}} was how he had treated her. His famous desire for her, what had it been but this same attempt to strike a magic fire out of her, for his own ecstasy. They were playing the same game of fire. In him, however, <b>there</b> was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{something}} hard and reckless and defiant, which stood apart. She was absolutely gone in her own incantations. She was absolutely gone, like a priestess utterly involved in her terrible rites. And {{he was part of}} the ritual only, God and victim in one. God and victim! <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> God and victim. When his aloof soul realised, amid the welter of incantation, how he was being used,--not as himself but as something quite different--God and victim--then he dilated with intense surprise, and his remote soul stood up tall and knew itself alone. He didn't want it, not at all. He knew he was apart. And he looked back over the whole mystery of their love-contact. Only his soul was apart.|$|R
