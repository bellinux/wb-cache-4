5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E

5|$|Biden {{was born}} in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1942, and lived there for ten years before moving {{with his family to}} Delaware. He became an {{attorney}} in 1969, and was elected to the New Castle County council in 1970. He was first elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1972, and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Senate, Stanley {{returned}} to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, he threw his support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve his chances of returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1930. Beckham lost to Republican Flem D. Sampson, greatly diminishing Stanley's chances in the senatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Parker was {{the caucus}} nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri Senate seat. However, the {{political}} tide had shifted in Missouri; it seemed unlikely {{that he would}} be elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> so he sought a presidential appointment as judge for the Western District of Arkansas.|$|E
5000|$|These factors doubtless contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate’s</b> {{decision}} <b>to</b> readmit <b>the</b> Jews in December 1573.

Another proposal presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Venetian <b>Senate</b> earlier that year suggested the Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal be permitted entry, provided they lived in ghettos.

5|$|In 1884, McCreary {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a legislator, he was an advocate of free silver and a champion of the state's agricultural interests. After two failed bids for election <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> McCreary secured the support of Governor J. C. W. Beckham, and in 1902, the General Assembly elected him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> He served one largely undistinguished term, and Beckham successfully challenged him for his Senate seat in 1908. The divide between McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> McLaurin, {{who had been a}} Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E

5|$|McCreary {{campaigned for}} Democrat William Goebel during the {{controversial}} 1899 gubernatorial campaign. Between 1900 and 1912, he represented Kentucky at four consecutive Democratic National Conventions. Governor J. C. W. Beckham and his well-established political machine supported McCreary's nomination <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1902. His opponent, incumbent William J. Deboe, {{had been elected}} as a compromise candidate six years earlier, becoming Kentucky's first-ever Republican senator. Deboe had done little to secure support from legislators since his election, however, and McCreary was easily elected {{by a vote of}} 95–30. Following his election <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> McCreary supported Beckham's gubernatorial re-election bid in 1903. In a largely undistinguished term as a senator, he continued to advocate the free coinage of silver and tried to advance the state's agricultural interests.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the House of Delegates, the Senate has {{the sole}} {{responsibility}} in the state's legislative branch for confirming gubernatorial appointees to positions that require confirmation. After the Governor forwards his nomination <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> the Executive Nominations Committee reviews the nominee and makes a recommendation for confirmation or rejection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> as a whole. Only one gubernatorial nominee in recent history has been rejected; Lynn Buhl, nominated as Maryland Secretary of the Environment by Governor Robert Ehrlich, was rejected over concerns about her qualifications. The Senate also has sole responsibility for trying any persons that have been impeached by the House of Delegates. They must be sworn in before such a trial takes place, and a two-thirds majority is required for conviction of the impeached person.|$|E
