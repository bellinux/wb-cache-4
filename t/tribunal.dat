This includes the Tribunal's {{view of the}} validity of any law, the bill of which {{has been the subject of}} a reference to a <b>Tribunal.</b> This means that although the <b>Tribunal</b> lies outside the normal hierarchy of the courts since it does not hear appeals from any courts, its opinions are binding on all other courts.

5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown <b>Tribunal</b> and Lithuanian <b>Tribunal.</b> The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State <b>Tribunal</b> of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals <b>Tribunal</b> opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the <b>Tribunal</b> was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the <b>Tribunal</b> reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the <b>Tribunal</b> found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The <b>Tribunal</b> did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E
50|$|Employment <b>tribunals</b> {{were created}} as {{industrial}} <b>tribunals</b> by the Industrial Training Act 1964. Industrial <b>tribunals</b> were judicial bodies {{consisting of a}} lawyer, who was the chairman, an individual nominated by an employer association, and another by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) or TUC-affiliated union. These independent panels heard and made legally binding rulings in relation to employment law disputes. Under the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998, their name was changed to employment <b>tribunals</b> from 1 August 1998. Employment <b>Tribunals</b> continue to perform the same function as the Industrial <b>Tribunals.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{recent article}} in the California Law Review by Professors Eric Posner and John Yoo, Judicial Independence in International <b>Tribunals,</b> argues that the only {{effective}} international <b>tribunals</b> are dependent <b>tribunals,</b> by which the authors mean ad hoc <b>tribunals</b> staffed by judges closely controlled by governments {{through the power of}} reappointment or threats of retaliation. Independent <b>tribunals,</b> by contrast, meaning <b>tribunals</b> staffed by judges appointed on similar terms as those in domestic courts, pose a danger to international cooperation. According to Posner and Yoo, independent <b>tribunals</b> are suspect because {{they are more likely to}} allow moral ideals, ideological imperatives or the interests of other states to influence their judgments. In this response, we identify the many shortcomings in the theory, methodology, and empirics in Judicial Independence in International <b>Tribunals.</b> We do so to challenge the authors 2 ̆ 7 core conjecture: that formally dependent international <b>tribunals</b> are correlated with effective judicial outcomes. We then offer our own counter-theory; a theory of constrained independence in which states establish independent international <b>tribunals</b> to enhance the credibility of their commitments and then use more fine grained structural, political, and discursive mechanisms to limit the potential for judicial excesses...|$|R

40|$|For {{my thesis}} I {{would like to}} focus on the two <b>tribunals</b> that are most well known in the world, the ICTY and the ICTR.

40|$|While {{there has}} been a {{significant}} focus on a few international <b>tribunals,</b> there have been insufficient efforts to compare and contrast the various courts and <b>tribunals.</b> Even a cursory comparison of these <b>tribunals</b> reveals that there are many unanswered questions regarding the interrelationship of these courts and <b>tribunals</b> and, more disturbing, a profound lack of attention to the collective impact these international <b>tribunals</b> are having on the field of international law. That is changing, as is evidenced by the new Project on International Courts and <b>Tribunals</b> at New York University School of Law, but we as an international legal community are still in the earliest stages of analyzing the importance of these new <b>tribunals.</b> This lecture will sample a few of the representative issues that merit further attention...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Tribunal</b> has to {{consider}} and {{answer a question}} referred to it not more than 60 days after the date of such reference. The <b>Tribunal</b> is mandated to certify to the President for his information its opinion on the question referred to it with reasons for its answer, and any <b>Tribunal</b> judge who differs from {{the opinion of the}} majority shall similarly certify his opinion and his reasons. The opinion of the majority of judges is the opinion of the <b>Tribunal,</b> and is required to be pronounced in open court.|$|E
5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional <b>Tribunal</b> {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the <b>Tribunal</b> is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the <b>Tribunal</b> feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional <b>Tribunal,</b> the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional <b>Tribunal</b> rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the <b>Tribunal</b> when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} <b>Tribunal</b> the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the <b>Tribunal</b> not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the <b>Tribunal</b> rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} the conventional view of contemporary international adjudication. It identifies {{a new generation}} of international <b>tribunals,</b> which has been largely ignored by commentators, and argues that these <b>tribunals</b> offer a highly successful, alternative model to traditional public-international-law adjudicatory bodies. The proliferation of international <b>tribunals</b> is widely {{regarded as one of the}} most significant developments in international law over the past century. The subject has given rise to an extensive and robust body of academic commentary. Although commentators reach widely divergent conclusions about many aspects of international law and adjudication, they all agree that international <b>tribunals</b> differ fundamentally from national courts. In particular, according to the commentary, international <b>tribunals</b> such as the International Court of Justice lack the power to render enforceable decisions or to exercise compulsory jurisdiction. This Article argues that commentators have proceeded from a flawed and incomplete understanding of contemporary international adjudication. Virtually all commentary on the subject ignores the development of a second generation of international <b>tribunals,</b> best represented by international commercial and investment <b>tribunals,</b> World Trade Organization panels, and claims-settlement mechanisms. Contrary to the conventional wisdom about international adjudication, this new generation of international <b>tribunals</b> has the power to exercise what is effectively compulsory jurisdiction and to render enforceable decisions that can often be coercively executed against states and their commercial assets. These second-generation <b>tribunals</b> have been the most frequently used and, in many respects, the most successful form of international adjudication in recent decades. The caseloads of these <b>tribunals</b> have grown rapidly over the past forty years and now substantially exceed those of traditional public-international-law <b>tribunals.</b> Moreover, an analysis of state treatymaking practice over recent decades shows that states have virtually never concluded treaties accepting the jurisdiction of traditional first-generation tribunals—concluding less than one treaty per year—whereas they have frequently accepted the jurisdiction of second-generation <b>tribunals</b> capable of rendering enforceable decisions—accepting some fifty treaties per year. More fundamentally, second-generation <b>tribunals</b> have played an essential role in facilitating international trade, finance, and investment; have contributed to the development of important fields of international law; and have provided leading contemporary examples of international law working in practice. Although largely ignored by the commentary, the success and frequent use of second-generation <b>tribunals</b> have important implications for conventional analysis of international adjudication. The success of these <b>tribunals</b> flatly contradicts the claims, advanced by a number of academic commentators, that international adjudication is unimportant in contemporary international affairs and that states do not use international tribunals—particularly <b>tribunals</b> that would be effective. In reality, second-generation <b>tribunals</b> have been frequently and successfully used in vitally important fields, in part because they issue effective and enforceable decisions. At the same time, the success of second-generation <b>tribunals</b> also contradicts prescriptions, offered by a number of commentators, that future international <b>tribunals</b> be modeled on “independent” first-generation <b>tribunals</b> or, alternatively, on entirely “dependent” adjudicative mechanisms. Successful second-generation <b>tribunals</b> exhibit a blend of structural characteristics that defy blanket prescriptions for either “independence” or “dependence” and that counsel for more tailored, nuanced institutional designs...|$|R
