5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fire}} brigade had trouble {{bringing}} the inferno {{in the main}} cell block under control, as the prison's gate was <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> for their trucks, and prisoners impeded their endeavours by throwing debris at them.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighbouring}} Russell {{family of}} Aden were concerned their land would be flooded when {{the lake was}} built, and their animosity was fully demonstrated when a bridge had to be jointly constructed by the two landowners over the River Ugie. It was wide enough for carriages on the Pitfour side but <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> on the Russell's half.|$|E
5|$|Yoke valves {{are rated}} between 200 and 240 bar, and {{there does not}} appear to be any {{mechanical}} design detail preventing connection between any yoke fittings, though some older yoke clamps will not fit over the popular 232/240 bar combination DIN/yoke cylinder valve as the yoke is <b>too</b> <b>narrow.</b>|$|E

60|$|Crawling Elk, with {{a half-dozen}} {{of his head}} men, was seated in his tepee, calmly {{discussing}} the same question. The canvas of his lodge was raised, as much to insure privacy as to let the wind sweep through. It {{was not easy to}} accuse any man of this crime, or even to suggest the name of any one as capable of such a foolish deed of blood. For relationships were close; therefore it was that he, <b>too,</b> <b>narrowed</b> the investigation down to Cut Finger. It is easier to accuse the son of a neighbor than your own son, especially if that other is already a marked man among reckless youths.|$|R

5|$|Bristol Bridge, {{the only}} way of {{crossing}} the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> and congested to cope with the amount of traffic that needed to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. Eleven people were killed and 45 injured, {{making it one of the}} worst riots of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much <b>too</b> <b>narrow,</b> and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E
5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is <b>too</b> <b>narrow,</b> but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{there is}} {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} parallel genetic algorithms used for segmentation of brain images and how their efficiency varies in the cloud setup with Hadoop. Since the current health care industry is moving towards the utmost usage of cloud to make the data available round the clock for the analysis, it is mandatory that {{the efficiency of the}} analysis also to be enhanced to produce the accurate result. Here, {{the focus is on the}} study of medical image processing that <b>too</b> <b>narrowed</b> down to the brain images with the help of parallel genetic algorithms in the cloud environment. The study aims to help the researchers to augment the competence of the algorithm when it functions in the remote cloud setup...|$|R
50|$|In Alicante <b>too,</b> the <b>narrow</b> gauge railway {{is being}} {{developed}} into a modern tramway. It has been extended through a tunnel to Mercado and will ultimately reach the RENFE railway station through an extension of this tunnel.

5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} after Thrud issue 1 was published, Critchlow {{returned}} to 2000AD using his new computer-drawn style. His first story was the Judge Dredd, Out of the Undercity story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by 2000AD Review and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> a palette, with too many greys and blues, although {{this might have been}} {{as a result of the}} story being set underground.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{has limited}} {{examples}} of Brutalism, one such being the Leeds International Swimming Pool (designed by disgraced architect John Poulson). until {{the commencement of}} its demolition in Autumn 2009, following its closure in October 2007. The Leeds International Pool was not without its design flaws, the pool size was miscalculated and was less than an inch <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> to qualify for Olympic Standard meaning that it never held the competitions the council had hoped for and it {{spent much of the}} 1960s closed while problems with its construction were rectified.|$|E

5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were <b>too</b> <b>narrow.</b> A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|The watchmen {{were quick}} to sound the alarm, but given the fire department's {{relatively}} primitive equipment, {{the fact that the}} streets of Vester Kvarter were <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> for the fire pumps, the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire, and a series of unlucky events, the fight was nearly hopeless. The wind blew from the southwest that evening, carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde, Store Sankt Clemens Stræde, Vombadstuestræde, Antiquitetsstræde and Hellig-Kors Stræde. By 9:00 p.m the main street of Vestergade was burning on both sides. From here the fire spread along Store Lars Bjørns Stræde, Lille Lars Bjørns Stræde and Studiestræde.|$|E

5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> for it.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, {{but the group}} has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E
50|$|Ticinosuchus {{is thought}} to be very close to or {{possible}} even the same species that made the Cheirotherium trace fossils found in Germany. It <b>too</b> shows a <b>narrow</b> track-way, similar to that of Tinicosuchus.|$|R

5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed {{during one of his}} routine pit stops due to a problem with a loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be <b>too</b> <b>narrow</b> for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
5|$|The Limehouse Cut {{would give}} {{direct access to}} the River Thames, {{avoiding}} the tidal Bow Creek. It was expected to open in July 1770, but some of the brickwork collapsed, and had to be repaired before the cut opened on 17 September 1770. It closed again briefly in December, when a bridge collapsed into it, and it was soon decided that it was <b>too</b> <b>narrow,</b> and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length. This work was finished on 1 September 1777. The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768, and a bricklayer called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on the cut on 23 April 1768. A millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper was given the job of building Bromley Lock (close to Bow tidal gates). Work progressed quickly, and the cut was opened for traffic on 7 August 1769.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is <b>too</b> <b>narrow,</b> in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
50|$|According {{to local}} sceptics, {{most of the}} {{accidents}} were caused by people who were unfamiliar with the area driving <b>too</b> fast down <b>narrow</b> country roads with high walled sides, resulting in them either losing control or misjudging the road and running off its edges.|$|R
30|$|Philosophies {{of science}} and {{environmental}} sociology (such as those of Robert Merton and Karl Popper) have long debated the role of science in society and in decision-making processes, firstly posing high confidence in science {{as the source of}} every solution for improving human conditions and later on questioning the reliability of scientific results and raising scepticism about science and scientists. Other studies relate to the discussion about ‘technological optimism’, which emphasizes the role of technology and proposes technological efficiency as the solution for improving sustainability [12, 13], and ‘science scepticism’, which poses the blame for environmental problems to the scientific approach and its being <b>too</b> <b>narrowed</b> about technological improvements without considering the human dimension of society [14 – 16]. The debate is still ongoing, as demonstrated by the essay ‘We cannot live by scepticism alone’ published in 2009 by Collins [17] and the related letters published on the following issue of Nature (see, for instance, [18, 19]). Recent studies advocate also a civil role by scientists in democracy: Dean [20] states that scientists should understand that trying to interpret the scientific results and to communicate them to the politicians and to the public is not a waste of time but a valuable public engagement.|$|R
