5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered {{so far have been}} found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for Category 4 by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would round down to 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02km/h, which according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
5|$|Two spur routes {{were added}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of Route30 in 1914. One of these, a route {{connecting}} Lockport to Medina, utilized {{what is now}} NY31 from the Lockport city line to NY77 and from Gasport Road in Gasport to Medina (via modern NY31E). On March1, 1921, several routes were altered or eliminated {{as part of a}} partial renumbering of the legislative route system. Among these was Route30, which was modified to follow Ridge Road instead between Ridgeway and Rochester. Its former routing from Medina eastward and the Lockport spur of Route30 mostly became part of an extended Route20, which now began in North Tonawanda and followed modern NY425 and Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads north and east through Cambria Center to Lockport. From Middleport to Medina, however, Route20 was routed on modern NY31 instead. East of Rochester, the section of Route20 between Fairport and Macedon was reconfigured to utilize what is now NY250 and NY31.|$|E

5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, it is the case that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E
