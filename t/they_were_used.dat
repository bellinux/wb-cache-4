5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E
5|$|After the Munich Agreement, two tank battalions {{were sent}} to {{reinforce}} the 3rd Mobile Division in Slovakia. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They screened the infantry {{when they had to}} evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938.|$|E
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> for agriculture. In Paris, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E
50|$|Because silhouettes give a {{very clear}} image, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often <b>used</b> in any field where the speedy {{identification}} of an object is necessary. Silhouettes have many practical applications. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> for traffic signs (see pic below). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to identify towns or countries with silhouettes of monuments or maps. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to identify natural objects such as trees, insects and dinosaurs. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> in forensic science.|$|R

5|$|Civil War tokens are token coins {{that were}} privately minted and {{distributed}} in the United States between 1861 and 1864. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.

5|$|Slaves {{were also}} used as {{craftsmen}} and tradespersons. As in agriculture, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> for labour that was beyond the capability of the family. The slave population was greatest in workshops: the shield factory of Lysias employed 120 slaves, {{and the father of}} Demosthenes owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{people used}} the {{turntable}} trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They were all called 'fire trebuchets' because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance. They were {{the ancestors of}} the cannon.|$|E
5|$|The main {{application}} of scandium by weight is in aluminium-scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components. These alloys contain between 0.1% and 0.5% of scandium. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> in the Russian military aircraft, specifically the MiG-21 and MiG-29.|$|E

50|$|The Legendary Cooking Utensils have immense power, whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being <b>used</b> by good or evil. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> by good, <b>they</b> {{can bring}} about great results that would make people happy. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> by evil, <b>they</b> can have {{destructive}} powers that could devastate all of China. Also, if a Legendary Cooking Utensil <b>is</b> <b>used</b> on something other than cooking (i.e. killing), its mystical powers would diminish.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> also <b>used</b> as {{measuring}} instruments for determining cyclic speed. As a timing light <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> {{to set the}} ignition timing of internal combustion engines.|$|R
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} June, the ZNDH {{received}} the first of 22 Bücker Bü 181 Bestmann aircraft. The 19th and 20th Transport Squadrons received five each, with the remainder issued to the 1st Pilot School. Besides liaison duties, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to transport fresh meat from Bosnia to Zagreb, {{where there was a}} food shortage.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 628 CTMS tanks were {{ordered by the}} Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. Of these, a small number were {{delivered}} to Java, {{just in time to}} see combat in the Dutch East Indies campaign following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. 149 from this order were diverted to Australia where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> for training. 600 CTLS-4TACs and 4TAYs were delivered to China under Lend-Lease after Pearl Harbor. After the war, the Indonesian Army is reported to have used several captured Dutch vehicles, with the type remaining in Indonesian service until 1949 amidst the Indonesian National Revolution.|$|E

5|$|After {{writing down}} rules {{about how the}} music was to be used, such as {{specific}} scenes certain songs should be used in, or ways a certain song should not be used, the game's scripters implemented the music at points they found fitting. During debugging, Nakazawa would request fixes for songs {{that he did not}} think fit the scenes <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> in. For the PlayStation Portable release, Asami Imai performed the opening theme.|$|E
5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} {{went from}} the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,600 people {{applied to}} be extras {{in the film}} during the open call on January 24, 2009 and January 25, 2009, at Crestwood Court in St. Louis, Missouri. Up in the Air cast 2,000 extras with 15 to 25 Missouri actors in minor {{speaking}} roles. About 250 extras were used from the Omaha, Nebraska, area. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> for filming {{inside and outside the}} terminal at Eppley Airfield, while Clooney acted out most of his scenes inside the terminal.|$|E

5|$|Both {{types of}} Bede's {{theological}} works circulated widely in the Middle Ages.

Some of Bede's homilies were collected by Paul the Deacon, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> in that form in the Monastic Office. Saint Boniface used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Connecticut-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In late 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, and in September that year, Minnesota was badly damaged by a mine laid by a German U-boat. After the war, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short. Within two years, all six ships had been sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Virginia-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet.

After the war, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> to bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short.
