40|$|Critical Realism, <b>the</b> <b>Capabilities</b> Approach, and Marxism, {{all have}} {{underdeveloped}} theoretical problems. For Critical Realism, the ceteris paribus clause, {{which is used}} to asses an ideological critique, does not properly specify what other things warrant the dismissal or acceptance of said critique. For <b>the</b> <b>Capabilities</b> Approach, a proper ontology or metaphysics is missing, and the claim that <b>the</b> <b>Capabilities</b> Approach can be metaphysically neutral is false. Finally, Marxism is good at describing the more onerous aspects of capitalism (e. g., alienation, exploitation, crisis), but it does not provide normative force for seeing these descriptions as bad. I argue that these three schools of thought, when connected through the ontology of Critical Realism, can be rendered mutually inclusive, and each theory can help address the lacuna in its respective counterpart. Critical Realism gives to Marxism and <b>the</b> <b>Capabilities</b> Approach ontological justification, and <b>the</b> <b>Capabilities</b> Approach gives to Critical Realism and Marxism normative force.

Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> {{approach}} developed by Economics Nobel prize winner A. K. Sen provides a sound theoretical framework to define disability. We first summarize different theoretical models of disability (the medical model, the social model, the Nagi model and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) of the World Health Organization (WHO)) and we present {{the main components of}} <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> approach. We then argue that <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> approach is a useful framework to define disability and differentiate disability at <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> level, potential disability, and at the functioning level, actual disability. This framework improves our understanding of disability by allowing us to analyze how disability results from the interaction between the personal characteristics, the resources and the environment (physical, social, economic, political) of the individual as well as the persons psychic state. <b>The</b> <b>capabilities</b> approach is also a model that recognizes that disability is based on value judgments concerning capabilities and functionings. In other words, selecting the evaluative dimensions of disability is an explicit social choice exercise. Determining a set of relevant capabilities {{that could be used in}} disability determination is outside the purview of this paper. Irrespective of this theoretical issue, <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> approach provides a sound framework to study disability, in particular, to analyze existing disability paradigms and assess the economic sources and consequences of disability...|$|R
