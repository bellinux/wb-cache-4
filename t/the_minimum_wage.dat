40|$|Statutory <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> was {{effective}} in Hong Kong on 1 May 2011. It is not a newly invented concept and actually many European and Asian countries have adopted <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy for long. Since the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages,</b> {{it has been a}} controversial topic in our Hong Kong society. Being the one works in the property management field, this dissertation aims to examine the implementation of <b>the</b> Statutory <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> among <b>the</b> property management companies in Hong Kong and to critically review and evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} this policy on the property management companies. Many scholars and economists have taken efforts to study the impacts of implementing <b>the</b> Statutory <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages.</b> By reviewing those studies it helps to understand the possible costs and benefits that <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy could bring. However, most of the studies are focused on the impacts of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy to <b>the</b> personal or society, very rare that they would have studied on the impacts of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> on a specific industry. There are also no scholars and economists did a research on the impacts of <b>the</b> Statutory <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> on <b>the</b> property management industry. To understand the impacts of <b>the</b> Statutory <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> on property management companies in Hong Kong, both primary and secondary data research has been conducted in order to find out the answer. For the secondary data research, data are collected via various channels including government’s report, Census and Statistics Department, journals, books and newspapers etc. For the primary data research, both qualitative and quantitative method has been used. The quantitative questionnaire interview aims to interview the people working in the property management companies and see how the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> could have impact on them. There is also a qualitative face to face interview to the property managers so as to understand the impacts of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy to <b>the</b> property management companies. By gathering the information and analysis the data, this paper suggests that at the current stage the implementation of <b>the</b> Statutory <b>Minimum</b> <b>Wages</b> could bring more benefits than costs to the property management companies in Hong Kong. The overall living standard and living quality of the people working in the property management companies has been improved. Although <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> would increase <b>the</b> company operation cost, it is suggested that the benefits generated could cover the cost increment in long run and it is worthy to continue the enactment of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> policy. Nevertheless, there is the recommendation that the future review of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> level should not be too aggressive. Prior any adjustment taken there should have a detail study on the market situation and the company affordability. Great changes at a time would be out of the affordability of the property management companies, which in turn would lead to the negative effect of close down of companies and trigger the layoff of employees. The policy should be review and adjust bit by bit so as to favor for the long term development of the property management companies in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the constitution of the erstwhile USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.|$|E
5|$|Mired in {{economic}} problems, Cuba was {{aided by the}} election of socialist and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels a day. That same year, Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some economic problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the modern}} period the {{situation}} of indigenous languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico, and the numbers of speakers of virtually all indigenous languages have dwindled. Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen over the past century, indigenous populations have become increasingly marginalized in Mexican society. In 1895, Nahuatl was spoken by over 5% of the population. By 2000, this proportion had fallen to 1.49%. Given the process of marginalization combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States, some linguists are warning of impending language death. At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of indigenous subsistence agriculturists. According to the Mexican national statistics institute, INEGI, 51% of Nahuatl speakers {{are involved in the}} farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage.</b>|$|E

30|$|The paper {{finds that}} in <b>the</b> {{manufacturing}} sector, <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> have negative employment effects on small firms {{but not on}} large firms. Since {{there are many more}} small firms, the aggregate effect of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> is to have an overall negative effect on formal employment, i.e. they lead to losses of formal jobs. The negative effects are largely concentrated among labor intensive firms with unskilled or less skilled workers. This finding has implications beyond the manufacturing sector, especially because Indonesia, like many developing economies, has a large concentration of low-skilled workers employed in small firms. Thus, sharp raises of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> could prevent job creation and retention, and a reduction in formal employment. As shown in other countries, increases in <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wages</b> without commensurate raises in worker productivity levels can lead to unemployment or increase informality among low-skill workers. Nonetheless, the negative effects of <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> changes on employment are much smaller than previous estimates.|$|R
