25|$|Diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 {{revealed}} Arab leaders {{singled out}} Iran {{as the greatest}} threat to regional stability, yet refuse to speak publicly, <b>telling</b> <b>US</b> diplomats in private, they would face domestic troubles if they were seen as siding with the West against a Muslim country. The cables showed that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain supported a military attack against Iran aimed to stop the Iranian nuclear program.|$|E

25|$|A celebration to God’s {{glory and}} to the dignity of man. All that’s left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked radish. There aren’t any celebrations. Ours, the {{scientists}} keep <b>telling</b> <b>us,</b> is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator is <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those who have access to this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Alhambra <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> of her {{conception}} in ‘the town’s only cinema’. We then come to “The Beginning”, {{which consists of}} a third-person narration focused first on Astrid, then Magnus, then Michael, then finally Eve. Through each character we obtain {{a different view of}} how Amber came into their lives, and who they believed her to be, when she arrived unannounced and uninvited at their Norfolk holiday home, claiming her car had broken down. Through “The Beginning”, we learn of Astrid’s obsession with video-taping her life, seemingly as proof it existed; of Magnus’ involvement in a school prank which resulted in the suicide of one of his classmates; of Michael’s affairs with his students (he is a university lecturer); and of Eve’s writer’s block.|$|E

25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} team, headed by Henry Millar, {{had arrived at}} South Beach, Nassau on January 12, 1987, almost a month before {{principal}} photography commenced there.

[...] A disembodied chorus urges West to 'run from the lights/ run for your life' on 'Lost in the World,' the record’s frenzied penultimate track; but even as we listen, we know there’s little chance that he’ll leave {{the spotlight}} behind. West is <b>telling</b> <b>us,</b> over the course of 11 songs, that he’s willing to die for our amusement, our respect." ...|$|E
60|$|The Epistle <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> {{that the}} Lord Jesus Christ is at hand, and that {{therefore}} we are to fret about nothing, but make our requests known to him. The Gospel <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> that he stands among <b>us.</b> The Collect <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> what we are to do, because he is at hand, because he stands among us.|$|R
60|$|Now how is that? The Catechism, I think, will <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> The Doxology, {{at the end}} of the Lord's Prayer, will <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> if we {{consider}} it.|$|R

500|$|He was {{released}} on October 17, 1838, though he refused to renounce his beliefs. His fellow patients reportedly thanked him as he left. McLean's superintendent Luther Bell took credit for saving him [...] "from the delusion of being a prophet extraordinaire", which Luther thought was caused by Very's digestive system being [...] "entirely out of order". The same month he {{was released}}, Very stayed with Emerson {{at his home in}} Concord for a week. While he was visiting, Emerson wrote in his journal on October 29, [...] "J.

500|$|Lucian Pintilie himself {{notes that}} Dumitriu's book, {{authored}} during the internationalist stage of communism, and before nationalism made a comeback with {{the rule of}} Nicolae Ceauşescu, is valid as a critique of interwar realities. According to Doinel Tronaru, the book chapter on which the film was based was itself controversial, and {{seen by many as}} [...] "indigestible". Tronaru writes: [...] "the film was made during the bloody Yugoslav conflict, but Pintilie is <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> [...] not to tune out believing we are somehow better, that, if need be, we could be just as bloodthirsty as our shunned neighbors." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work here, if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E

Before his death on 29 July 2013, Hussain watched the second Twenty20 International played between Pakistan and the West Indies. He {{died at the}} age of 83 from a heart attack in Karachi. His funeral was offered at Abu Bakar Siddiq mosque, DHA Phase-II, and he was buried at Gizri graveyard later that day.

60|$|Now, {{people do}} not often {{understand}} clearly why this is. They feel, more or less, that so it is; but they cannot explain it. I could tell you why they cannot; but I will not take up your time. But if they cannot explain it, {{there are those who}} can. St. Paul explains it in the Epistle. The Lord Jesus Himself explains it in the Gospel. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> why money will not make a gentleman. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> why poverty will not unmake one: but they <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> more. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> the one only thing which makes a true gentleman. And they <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> more still. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how every one of us, down to the poorest and most ignorant man and woman in this church, may become true gentlemen and ladies, in the sight of God and of all reasonable men; and that, not only in this life, but after death, for ever, and ever, and ever. And that is by charity, by love.|$|R

500|$|According to The Irish Times, [...] "Flame & Citron {{has sparked}} an emotive public debate in Denmark that has drawn {{all sorts of}} pseudo-experts out of the {{woodwork}} to debate the portrayal of the period and the two true-life figures". Madsen defended himself saying it was an interpretation that [...] "though it may not correspond absolutely to reality, is somehow more true". Mikkelsen stressed that they were the first [...] "to do the original research, yet we suddenly had a lot of so-called experts <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> how it really was and how we were wrong". The actor affirmed not too much is known about the period and they hope it sparks the debate so [...] "people will research and think some more about it".|$|E
500|$|The January 1938 Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, resolving the 1934 case, and {{the lifting of}} the {{injunction}} by an appeals court, sent the parties back to the negotiating table. Willkie kept the public pressure on: like most corporate executives, he had not spoken out against Roosevelt's New Deal policies, but in January stated in a radio debate that anti-utility policies were depressing share prices, making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover. [...] "For several years now, we have been listening to a bedtime story, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> that the men who hold office in Washington are, by their very positions, endowed with a special virtue."

The minister wrote that the people, especially the children, learned English with ease after they had learned to write Gaelic. The minister also gave some reasons why the people were keen to learn English, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "English being the language universally spoken by the higher classes, {{the mass of the}} people attach a notion of superior refinement to the possession of it". Half a century previously, Harry Robertson had praised the spirit of one watchmaker in the region, but added [...] "it is a pity that he can hardly read nor write, and hardly speaks English".|$|E
