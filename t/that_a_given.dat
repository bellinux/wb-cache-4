5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E

50|$|In robust {{statistics}} and computational geometry, simplicial depth {{is a measure}} of central tendency determined by the simplices <b>that</b> contain <b>a</b> <b>given</b> point.

25|$|A typeI error {{occurs when}} the null {{hypothesis}} (H0) is true, but is rejected. It is asserting something that is absent, a false hit.

25|$|By {{determining}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> experiment or {{method of}} detection is sensitive and reliable enough to detect the presence of X (when X is present) one can confidently exclude the possibility that X may be both undetected and present.

25|$|As many {{electromagnetic}} attacks, especially SEMA attacks, rely on asymmetric implementations of cryptographic algorithms, {{an effective}} countermeasure {{is to ensure}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> operation performed at a given step of the algorithm gives no information {{on the value of}} that bit. Randomization of the order of bit encryption, process interrupts, and clock cycle randomization, are all effective ways to make attacks more difficult.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{specifically}} {{in the field of}} finite group theory, the Sylow theorems are a collection of theorems named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow (1872) that give detailed information about the number of subgroups of fixed order <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> finite group contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the classification of finite simple groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{vastness of}} the North American continent, and the variety of its climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landforms, led ancient peoples to {{coalesce}} into many distinct linguistic and cultural groups.

25|$|The gas used {{should have}} a low heat capacity, so <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> amount of {{transferred}} heat leads to a large increase in pressure.

Following one such accident Philips pioneered the use of other gases to avoid such risk of explosions.|$|E
