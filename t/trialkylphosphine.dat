50|$|N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are {{particularly}} common carbene ligands. They are popular {{because they are}} more readily prepared than Schrock and Fischer carbenes. In fact many NHCs are isolated as the free ligand, since they are persistent carbenes. Being strongly stabilized by π-donating substituents, NHCs are powerful σ-donors but π-bonding with the metal is weak. For this reason, the bond between the carbon and the metal center is often represented by a single dative bond, whereas Fischer and Schrock carbenes are usually depicted with double bonds to metal. Continuing with this analogy, NHCs are often compared with <b>trialkylphosphine</b> ligands. Like phosphines, NHCs serve as spectator ligands that influence catalysis through a combination of electronic and steric effects, but they do not directly bind substrates.

40|$|Although several {{theoretical}} {{models for the}} behavior of magnetic crystals smaller than a single domain size were developed in the 1950 's and 60 's, they have hardly been verified experimentally {{because of the lack}} of appropriate material systems. This thesis is an attempt to develop such a system using metallic cobalt as a magnetic material and to verify its magnetic behavior in the context of a Stoner-Wohlfarth model of coherent rotation. The problem of preparing crystals of a desired shape and the effect of the crystal shape on its magnetic properties is also addressed. Cobalt nanocrystals are prepared by thermal decomposition of dicobalt octacarbonyl in solution and in the presence of suitable surfactants and coordinating ligands, which influence the shape of the resulting crystals as well as their internal structure. The presence of <b>trialkylphosphines</b> in the growth solution leads to the formation of spherical nanocrystals with mixed fcc-hcp structure, where as trioctylphosphine oxide leads to a newly discovered structure of [epsilon]-cobalt. The final size of the crystals is controlled by the precursor-to-ligand ratio, and low polydispersity is achieved by the separation of nucleation and growth stages. Size-selective precipitation is used to further reduce the size variation of the samples. As a result, cobalt nanocrystals in the size range of 4 - 12 nm in diameter can be routinely produced with size distributions as small as 6 %. The study of magnetic properties reveals the superparamagnetic nature of cobalt nanocrystals of this size range at room temperature. At low temperatures, a good qualitative agreement with the theoretical (Stoner-Wohlfarth) model is found,(cont.) although quantitative results are strongly influenced by the presence of an oxide shell around each nanocrystal. The presence of two surfactants (<b>trialkylphosphines</b> and sodium carboxylates) during the growth leads to the formation of a significant number of triangular and rod-shaped nanocrystals. Unlike disordered spherical particles, these nanocrystals have pure fcc structure without visible defects. The length of the rods is roughly controlled by the concentration of carboxylates in the growth solution and can be changed within a 40 - 400 nm range. Unlike spherical crystals of comparable volume, the rods are ferromagnetic even at room temperature due to an added effect of shape anisotropy.

40|$|International audienceThe palladium-catalyzed β-arylation of ester enolates with aryl {{bromides}} was studied both experimentally and computationally. First, {{the effect}} of the ligand on the selectivity of the α/β-arylation reactions of ortho- and meta-fluorobromobenzene was described. Selective β-arylation was observed for the reaction of o-fluorobromobenzene with a range of biarylphosphine ligands, whereas α-arylation was predominantly observed with m-fluorobromobenzene for all ligands except DavePhos, which gave an approximate 1 : 1 mixture of α-/β-arylated products. Next, {{the effect of}} the substitution pattern of the aryl bromide reactant was studied with DavePhos as the ligand. We showed that electronic factors {{played a major role in}} the α/β-arylation selectivity, with electron-withdrawing substituents favoring β-arylation. Kinetic and deuterium-labeling experiments suggested that the rate-limiting step of β-arylation with DavePhos as the ligand was the palladium-enolate-to-homoenolate isomerization, which occurs by a βH-elimination, olefin-rotation, and olefin-insertion sequence. A dimeric oxidative-addition complex, which was shown to be catalytically competent, was isolated and structurally characterized. A common mechanism for α- and β-arylation was described by DFT calculations. With DavePhos as the ligand, the pathway leading to β-arylation was kinetically favored over the pathway leading to α-arylation, with the palladium-enolate-to-homoenolate isomerization being the rate-limiting step of the β-arylation pathway and the transition state for olefin insertion its highest point. The nature of the rate-limiting step changed with PCy(3) and PtBu(3) ligands, and with the latter, α-arylation became kinetically favored. The trend in selectivity observed experimentally with differently substituted aryl bromides agreed well with that observed from the calculations. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups on these bromides mainly affected the α-arylation pathway by disfavoring C-C reductive elimination. The higher activity of the ligands of the biaryldialkylphosphine ligands compared to their corresponding <b>trialkylphosphines</b> could be attributed to stabilizing interactions between the biaryl backbone of the ligands and the metal center, thereby preventing deactivation of the β-arylation pathway...|$|R

The equilibrium constants for the preequilibrium step (K, M-l) and the rate constants for C-C coupling (kz, s-l) are obtained from analysis of kinetic data for phosphines of widely different steric and electronic properties. The K values are greater for R = CHMez than for R = Me, and increase with increasing electron withdrawing character of the para substituent of isosteric triarylphosphines [P(P-XCGH) T]h. e effects of structural and electronic changes indicate that the molecular complex [(q 5 -CgH 7) Fe(CO) 2 R, phosphine] forms through an electron donor-acceptor interaction, in which the iron complex behaves as donor and the phosphine as acceptor. Correlation of K values for triarylphosphines with the a, constants displays electronic sensitivity for precursor formation as e = 0. 62 for R = CHMe 2 (20 "C) and e = 0. 47 for R = Me (40 °C).

The carbon-proton coupling constants in benzene are J CCH = + 1. 0, J CCCH = + 7. 4 and J CCCH = - 1. 1 Hz. Extended Hückel wavefunctions are uniformly poor in explaining the long-range, carbon-proton couplings in aromatic systems. Couplings between carbon and elements other than hydrogen have been observed in proton decoupled 13 C spectra. All of the carbons in fluorobenzene and 1 -fluoronaphthalene, but only six of the carbons in 2 -fluoronaphthalene are coupled to the fluorine. One-bond, carbon-phosphorus coupling in <b>trialkylphosphines</b> is negative, while one-bond, carbon-phosphorus coupling in tetra-alkylphosphonium ions is positive. Atoms which do not use hybrid orbitals to form bonds to carbon (F, P(III), Se, Te) may have negative, one-bond coupling constants because of the failure of the average energy approximation. One-bond couplings between carbon and carbon, silicon, tin, lead and mercury appear to be explainable in terms of an effective nuclear charge and the s-bond order of the metal. Couplings between carbon and nitrogen and phosphorus (IV) have significant negative contributions to the Fermi contact coupling expression, though, within one series, correlations with s-bond order may be valid. Carbon-carbon coupling in cyclopropane derivatives (10 - 15 Hz) is consistent with a high degree of p character in the interior orbitals. Some two- and three-bond carbon-carbon coupling constants have also been observed. Substituent effects of hydroxyl groups on the 13 C chemical shifts of continuous-chain alkanes depend both on steric and electronic factors. The hydroxyl substituent effects in the long-chain, primary alcohols are α = - 48. 3, β = - 10. 2, and γ = + 6. 0 ppm.

The reactions involving aryl chlorides were considerably slower, although the addition of triphenylphosphine and heating at 70 °C allowed high conversion of electron deficient derivatives. Addition of water and hexane to the reaction products results in a triphasic system, from which the catalyst was then recycled by removing the top (hexanes) and bottom (aqueous) layers and adding the reagents to the ionic liquid which was heated again at 50 °C; resulting in complete turnover of iodobenzene. Repetition of this procedure gave the biphenyl product in 82 - 97 % yield (repeated five times) for both the initial and recycled reaction sequences. IL ESTERIFICATIONREACTION A new class oftrialkylphosphorane has been prepared through reaction of a <b>trialkylphosphine</b> with 2 -chlorodimethylmalonate in the presence oftriethylamine. These new reagents promote the condensation reaction of carboxylic acids with alcohols to provide esters along with <b>trialkylphosphine</b> oxide and dimethylmalonate. The condensation reaction of chiral secondary alcohols can be controlled to give either high levels of inversion or retention through a subtle interplay involving basicity of the reaction media, solvent, and tuning the electronic and steric nature of the carboxylic acid and stenc nature of the phosphorane employed. A coherent mechanism is postulated to explain these observations involving reaction via an initial acyloxyphosphonium ion...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{investigation}} {{is the development of}} a fast and reliable extractant screening approach. Phenol extraction is selected as the model process. A quantum chemical conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) is combined with molecular design considerations. For this purpose, phenol distribution coefficients KD of known phenol extractants are determined experimentally and in silico. Molecular variations of different extractants are tested concerning their effect on KD to facilitate extractant improvement. It is shown that KD depends on the molecular structure of the extractant. Calculations with COSMO-RS provide a qualitative trend of simulated extraction efficiency and even a quantitatively correct description of KD. The simulations for alkylamine components are, however, not accurate, which is a well-known problem. During the screening process, phosphorus containing aliphatic substances, especially the <b>trialkylphosphine</b> oxide compound Cyanex 923, were determined as the most promising phenol extractants, which agrees with the state of the art...|$|E

A smart optimal DoE-based algorithm is implemented {{to increase the}} turnover number and yield of the catalytic system considering both discrete variables—palladacycle and ligand—and continuous variables—temperature, time, and loading—simultaneously. The use of feedback allows for experiments to be run with catalysts and under conditions more likely to produce an optimum; consequently complex reaction optimizations are completed within 96 experiments. Response surfaces predicting reaction performance near the optima are generated and validated. From the screening results, shared attributes of successful precatalysts are identified, leading to improved understanding {{of the influence of}} ligand selection upon transmetalation and oxidative addition in the reaction mechanism.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis, structure/bonding studies and reactivity of cationic terminal borylene complexes. Reactions of the cationic terminal borylene complexes, [CpFe(CO) ₂(BNR₂) ]⁺[BArf₄]⁻ (R = Cy, ⁱPr) with heteroallenes {{have been investigated}} and shown to proceed by initial coordination of the substrate at the electrophilic boron centre. Reaction with isocyanate ultimately forms [CpFe(CO) ₂(CNPh) ]⁺[BArf₄]⁻ by a net metathesis process. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, however, reacts by insertion into the Fe=B bond of the aminoborylene to form [CpFe(CO) ₂C(NCy) ₂BNR₂]⁺[BArf₄]⁻. An excess of the substrate yields the spirocyclic complex, [CpFe(CO) ₂C(NCy) ₂B(NCy) ₂BNR₂]⁺[BArf₄]⁻ via a second insertion into the B=N bond. Computational studies investigating insertion and metathesis reaction pathways of these aminoborylene complexes are also reported. Reactions of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with three-coordinate aminoborane and aminoboryl complexes are described. Formation of the first boron guanidinate complexes featuring dihalide substituents, Cy₂NC(NCy) ₂BCl₂ and ⁱPr₂NC(NCy) ₂BCl₂ by both salt metathesis and carbodiimide insertion routes are reported. The aminoboryl complexes, CpFe(CO) ₂B(NPh₂) Cl and CpFe(CO) ₂B(NBz₂) Cl have also been synthesized and their reactions with carbodiimides probed. A novel cationic terminal borylene complex, [Cp'Fe(CO) ₂(BNⁱPr₂) ]⁺ [BArf₄]⁻ featuring a methyl-substituted Cp ring is reported and represents the first structurally characterized isopropyl substituted aminoborylene complex. Substitution of the ancillary carbonyl ligands of cationic terminal borylene complexes has been investigated. Irradiation of the aminoboryl precursor complex, CpFe(CO) ₂B(NCy₂) Cl {{in the presence of}} <b>trialkylphosphines,</b> PR₃ (PR₃ = PMe₃, PPh₃, P(OMe) ₃) yield the mono(phosphine) complexes, CpFe(CO) (PR₃) B(NCy₂) Cl. The mono(substituted) dimer [{CpFe(CO) (BNCy₂) }₂(μ-dmpe) ] was also formed from the reaction with the chelating ligand, dmpe. Replacement of the second carbonyl is prevented by the steric bulk of the dicyclohexylamino substituent, and instead [CpFe(CO) (PR₃) ₂]⁺Cl⁻ is formed by extrusion of the borylene fragment. The mono(phosphine) ligated cationic terminal borylene complexes, [CpFe(CO) (PR₃) (BNCy₂) ]⁺[BArf₄]⁻ were subsequently formed by halide abstraction. Both [CpFe(CO) (PMe₃) (BNCy) ₂]⁺[BArf₄]⁻ and the bridging dication [{CpFe(CO) (BNCy₂) }₂(μ-dmpe) ]₂⁺[BArf₄]⁻₂ were structurally authenticated. Replacing the bulky cyclohexyl groups of the aminoboryl precursor for methyl groups allowed synthesis of the bis(substituted) complexes, CpFe(PMe₃) ₂B(NMe₂) Cl and CpFe(dmpe) B(NMe₂) Cl. Extraction of these complexes into dichloromethane resulted in formation of the borylene, [CpFe(PMe₃) ₂(BNMe₂) ]⁺Cl⁻ and [CpFe(dmpe) (BNMe₂) ]⁺Cl⁻ by spontaneous halide ejection.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{synthesis}} {{and application of}} tetraalkylphosphonium-based ionic liquids towards the dissolution of cellulose (and lignocellulose) is explored. Ionic liquids were synthesised from <b>trialkylphosphines</b> by quaternisation with alkyl halides or dimethylcarbonate and subsequent anion exchange reactions. The ionic liquids were used to dissolve lignin, and were found only to dissolve cellulose upon addition of a polar aprotic molecular solvent, such as DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide). The cellulose dissolution capabilities {{of a range of}} these phosphonium ionic liquids in combination with DMSO was studied. It was found that these organic electrolyte solutions were very effective solvents for cellulose, with a high molar dissolution capacity. At the greatest extent, only one mole of ionic liquid per glucose units in cellulose is needed to dissolve cellulose. The role of the cation and anion in the dissolution process is explored, with the aid of solvent parametisation techniques and NMR studies. Other solvents, including GVL (gamma-valerolactone), were explored as greener replacements for DMSO. For the shorter chain phosphonium ionic liquids with DMSO and GVL, upper critical solution temperature behaviour was observed and explored in more detail. In these solutions, cellulose is only soluble at high temperatures, and reforms at low temperatures to form a gel with a spherical micro-particle morphology. The phase behaviour of hydrophobic phosphonium ionic liquids, DMSO, and water was studied and applied to the recovery of the ionic liquid after cellulose dissolution in the electrolyte solutions. Ternary phase diagrams of three of the hydrophobic ionic liquids in combination with DMSO and water were constructed. Finally, phosphonium ionic liquid and deuterated DMSO electrolytes were studied and successfully used for the NMR analysis of high molecular weight cellulose materials. Future work in this area is expected to focus further on the theoretical understanding of cellulose dissolution in phosphonium ionic liquid-based organic electrolyte solutions - with expanded NMR measurements, and other experimental techniques, in tandem with molecular dynamics modelling. Additionally, it is expected that techniques for the solution-state NMR of cellulose will be applied at extended range of analytes, including but not limited to, whole biomass, modified and unmodified nano-celluloses, and high molecular weight cellulose derivatives. The thermo-responsive behaviour (UCST-type) phase-separation of cellulose will continue to be explored especially in its application to new materials, included fibres and shaped spherical particles.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. In this study, the {{behaviour}} of an in situ-prepared RuCI 3. xH 20 catalytic system, {{where the}} active catalyst is generated using RuCI 3. xH 20 in EtOH, {{together with an}} alkyne, a ligand and an alkene substrate {{in the presence of}} a small H 2 sparge, was investigated. The influence of different reagents on the catalytic system was investigated by looking at metathesis of linear alkenes and NMR studies. A few additives that have an influence on the metathesis catalyst system were identified and the effects of these additives determined. The published mechanism of the catalyst system was verified by the results reported here, and some additional findings about the reaction rate were found. The reaction occurs via a hydride-to- carbene mechanism. It was found that the formation of the hydride is a fast reaction, and the subsequent formation of the carbene is the rate-determining step. The carbene is the metathesis active species. The carbene is formed by the reaction of RuCI 3. xH 20 dissolved in a reducing solvent (EtOH), {{in the presence of a}}n alkyne, a ligand and a linear alkene. The reaction with which the EtOH reduces RullI to RuII was not investigated. It was found that the best alkyne is a short-chain, terminal, unfunctionalised alkyne (1 -hexyne). BOD was also confirmed to be a good alkyne for the reaction, although 1 -hexyne afforded the highest metathesis of the alkynes investigated. The metathesis reaction is sensitive to the order of addition of the reagents. NMR studies showed that the phosphine ligand coordinates at room temperature to the Ru core, while the formation of the carbene only took place after heating of the reaction mixture to at least 50 °C. If the order of addition of the reagents is changed, side reactions take place that inhibits the formation of the carbene. A reaction with PIBu 3 as ligand showed that the steric bulk of the ligand is important, since it afforded considerably less metathesis than the more bulky PIPr 3. In addition to <b>trialkylphosphines,</b> a bicyclic phosphine ligand (EP) was found that afforded metathesis activity in the same order than PCy 3. By comparing this ligand with PCy 3, it was found that the bicyclic ligand afforded slower carbene formation and faster deactivation. The overall metathesis yield was still comparable. The optimum Ru:ligand ratio was different for the two ligands, with EP reaching an optimum ratio of 1 : 1. 5, compared to the optimum of 1 : 4 for PCy 3. The metathesis reaction was followed using NMR. This, together with results found when the time of Hz sparge was varied, showed that the carbene forms continuously during the reaction, but also deactivates continuously. The exact nature of the deactivation process was not determined during this study. The influence of the addition of hydrochloric acid to the reaction was also determined using NMR techniques. It was found that HCI protonates the phosphine as well as the phosphine oxide. Metathesis with other acids showed that acids have a effect on the metathesis reaction. The addition of strong sulphonic acids suppressed metathesis while promoting isomerisation and, in some cases, hydrogenation. The similar results from metathesis reactions with the addition of acetic acid and trifluoro acetic acid showed that the Brønsted acid strength is not the only factor that influences the reaction. The increased isomerisation using acid addition supports a hydride isomerisation mechanism. The use of chlorinated solvents, especially chloroform and chlorobenzene, for the ligand and alkyne increased metathesis. The best metathesis conversions were found using EtOH as solvent for the RuC 13. xH 20. No adverse effect due to ageing of the stock solutions was found, even after 3 months. The in situ catalyst system showed resistance to some oxygenates, but not to all of them. This shows that the presence of an 0 -atom is not sufficient for catalyst deactivation. Further studies in this field will be beneficial. Metathesis of an industrial C 7 alkene cut afforded less 6 -dodecene than expected from results obtained using 1 -octene. The turnover frequencies were lower using the industrially derived cut than using 1 -octene. The reactions using EP as ligand afforded significantly higher yields of 6 - dodecene than reactions using PCy 3 as ligand, but still less than the yields afforded by reactions using 1 -octene.
