5|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of a transit of Venus {{was made by}} Jeremiah Horrocks from his home at Carr House in Much Hoole, near Preston in England, on 4 December 1639 (24 November under the Julian calendar then in use in England). His friend, William Crabtree, also observed this transit from Broughton, near Manchester. Kepler had predicted transits in 1631 and 1761 and a near miss in 1639. Horrocks corrected Kepler's calculation for the orbit of Venus, realized that transits of Venus would occur in pairs 8 years apart, and so predicted the transit of 1639. Although he was uncertain of the exact time, he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately 15:00. Horrocks focused {{the image of the}} Sun through a simple telescope onto a piece of paper, where the image could be safely observed. After observing for most of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> lucky to see the transit as clouds obscuring the Sun cleared at about 15:15, just half an hour before sunset. Horrocks's observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus, as well as to make an estimate of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun— the astronomical unit. He estimated that distance to be 59.4millionmiles (95.6Gm, 0.639AU)– about two thirds of the actual distance of 93millionmiles (149.6 million km), but a more accurate figure than any suggested up to that time. The observations were not published until 1661, well after Horrocks's death.|$|E
