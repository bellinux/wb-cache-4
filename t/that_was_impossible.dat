5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), but was told <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible.</b> However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E
5|$|Because Hope was a work <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> to read {{using the}} {{traditional}} interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was {{a companion to}} Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting {{with his wife and}} his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E

500|$|In 1927, Perren Baker, Brownlee's Minister of Education, had {{announced}} as his priorities {{improving the quality}} of teaching and ensuring that sufficient schools existed for the growing number of students wishing to earn a high school diploma. [...] In pursuit of these objectives, he released a new School Act in 1929, whose major initiative was to consolidate Alberta's thousands of autonomous school districts, each with control over its own finances, into a smaller number of school divisions. [...] The act also moved responsibility for teacher salaries and employment conditions from the school districts to the provincial government and standardized educational mill rates across the province. [...] Educational reformers supported the legislation as a vehicle for coherent reform of the sort <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> under the decentralized status quo, but a large majority of rural residents, the staple of the UFA's support base, opposed it for fear that it would lead to the closure of local schools and greater travel distances for rural students. [...] While Brownlee strongly supported the bill, he ordered it withdrawn in deference to public opinion.|$|E

During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald views the track as [...] "blandly catchy" [...] and {{comments}} that its long stay at number 1 in Britain [...] "says {{more about the}} sudden decline of the singles chart than {{the quality of the}} song itself". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone considers that, at this stage in their career, [...] "the Beatles didn't need to push – they could have hit #1 with a tape of themselves blowing their noses", which, he suggests, [...] "would have been catchier" [...] than both [...] "Hello, Goodbye" [...] and the band's next single, [...] "Lady Madonna". Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham describes [...] "Hello, Goodbye" [...] as a [...] "harmless, facile word and chord-play that kept the far more challenging 'Walrus' from being the A-side of the [...] first post-Epstein single". Among other Beatles biographers, Andrew Hickey dismisses the song as a [...] "mindless little nothing" [...] that was [...] "completely outclassed by its flipside", while Peter Doggett labels it [...] "commercial but rather inconsequential... three minutes of contradictions and meaningless juxtapositions, with a tune <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> to forget".|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} {{with many of}} his scholar-gentry colleagues who lacked a military training, Định was regarded as having {{a good understanding of}} the capabilities and limitations of his armed resistance. Định hoped to wear down the French over an extended period by exploiting the constant outbreak of malaria among the Europeans. During the initial phase of the invasion in 1858, the French had suffered heavily from tropical disease. Định calculated that such illnesses would partly compensate for the inferior weaponry of his forces. He attempted to maintain an administration parallel to the one imposed on the districts by the French admirals. These objectives required a high degree of regional coordination, something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> without the support of the imperial bureaucracy. Định's appeal among the peasantry was attributed to their gratitude for his administration of the đồn điền. Under such a system, he was responsible for assisting them in matters such as clearing land, educating the community, providing health care and mediating disputes. Joining the resistance army was seen as a means of showing trust and gratitude. Hịch Trương Định (The proclamation of Trương Định), which was believed to have been written in 1862 or 1863, emphasised such themes. It read: ...|$|E
500|$|After 97 {{days with}} the [...] "Iron" [...] {{he moved on to}} Coventry City for a £60,000 fee, after impressing in a reserve team game between the two clubs. The {{management}} team of George Curtis and John Sillett offered Houchen £350 a week, £50 an appearance, a £10,000 signing-on fee, as well the chance to play First Division football. He struggled with injuries {{at the start of the}} 1986–87 campaign, but recovered to ensure his name went down in the club's history for his exploits in the FA Cup. He bagged five goals in their 1986–87 cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at Old Trafford against Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. He then scored two against Sheffield Wednesday in the quarter-finals, and one against Leeds United in the semi-finals, both games being held at Hillsborough. The final and most famous goal of the run came in the 1987 FA Cup Final in front of 98,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium in a 3–2 win over Tottenham Hotspur. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching food poisoning from a trout caught by reserve goalkeeper Jake Findlay. The goal came from a Dave Bennett cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> for Ray Clemence to save. It levelled the score at 2–2 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from Gary Mabbutt in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the BBC Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award for the 1986–87 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball. It is generally considered as one of the most famous goals scored at Wembley, and certainly the best headed goal.|$|E
500|$|By {{contrast}} to the strident condemnation of Meckiff in the English press, Australian opinion was mixed. The former Test opener and leading commentator Jack Fingleton said: [...] "when he [...] delivered to Bailey, his fastest ball looked most suspect" [...] and that the left-armer should have been called for throwing. Fingleton claimed to know of five former Australian Test cricketers who felt that Meckiff threw, but only named the 1930s paceman Ernie McCormick. Former Australian player Tommy Andrews claimed: [...] "if they stop throwing in Australia, cricket will die". Former Australian captain Ian Johnson argued that if Meckiff were to be cited for an illegal action for jerking his wrist, then leading English bowlers such as Trueman, Brian Statham and Tony Lock, who played against Australia during the season, should also be sanctioned. As with Meckiff, Lock was under scrutiny {{at the time and}} later tried to change his bowling action but the new style coincided with a downturn in results. Johnson also noted that any successful spinner would be called for throwing if the law were enforced strictly because of their flicking of the wrist and fingers during the delivery of the ball, as they could not otherwise extract spin. In 1993, Robert Coleman, the historian of the Victorian Cricket Association, decried the anti-Meckiff campaign as [...] "Fleet Street bleating", and said: [...] "there have been no more hysterical outbursts on the subject [...] than occurred during England's 1958–59 tour". Writing decades after the event, Pollard said [...] "Meckiff, in fact, went to the crease with a beautifully relaxed approach, paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight, and then let the ball go with a blurred swing of the arm <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> to follow from 60 yards away, even with the aid of good binoculars." ...|$|E

Admiral Otto von Diederichs reported to the Kaiser that the German Navy was now stronger than the US Navy, so it was up to the army {{to solve the problem of}} the land strategy. General Alfred von Schlieffen was doubtful of the whole venture; he reported to the Kaiser that 100,000 troops [...] "would probably be enough" [...] to take Boston, but that many more would be required to take New York, a city of three million.

According to the Court, the contradiction was [...] "of a nature to cause confusion over {{the identity of the}} person and consequently to weaken the legal and judicial security inherent in the highest office in the country". Yamgnane denounced the ruling, claiming its real motivation was to exclude [...] "the most dangerous candidate for the RPT".
