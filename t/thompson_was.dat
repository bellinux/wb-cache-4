5|$|Jim <b>Thompson</b> <b>was</b> {{hired by}} Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel. He {{worked on the}} {{screenplay}} for four months, changing some of the scenes and episodes in his novel.

5|$|Rather than {{wait for}} {{replacement}} equipment, Barnette purchased {{the press of}} a newly arrived editor, William Fentress Thompson, who had intended to set up his own newspaper. As part of the purchasing deal in August 1906, <b>Thompson</b> <b>was</b> allowed to publish an evening paper—the Tanana Daily Miner—while the Fairbanks Daily News {{was published in the}} morning. The deal lasted only through September, as Thompson and Barnette conflicted on a personal level. The Tanana Miner was reduced to a weekly newspaper, then <b>Thompson</b> <b>was</b> deposed as editor of the Fairbanks News in June 1907 and took the Tanana Miner to the settlement of Chena, outside Fairbanks. Barnette, meanwhile, became embroiled in a series of legal troubles. He faced opposition from the owner of the Fairbanks Times, A.L.

5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. <b>Thompson</b> <b>was</b> traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as <b>Thompson</b> <b>was</b> a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, <b>Thompson</b> <b>was</b> elected {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, {{with the result that}} his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. <b>Thompson</b> <b>was</b> involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E
