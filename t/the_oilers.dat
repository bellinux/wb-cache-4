5|$|With the NHL set {{to resume}} {{play for the}} 2005–06 season, Torres re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> to a two-year deal on August 16, 2005. Returning to <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> he scored a career-high 27 goals and 41 points. <b>The</b> <b>Oilers</b> entered the 2006 playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference. During the Western Conference Finals against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Torres missed games two and three due to the flu. Following his return the lineup, he scored the series-clinching goal in game five, a 2-1 win, to advance <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> into the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals. Against the Carolina Hurricanes, <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> faced a 3–1 series deficit before forcing a game seven. They were {{defeated}} in the deciding contest to lose the Stanley Cup. Torres notched four goals and 11 points over 22 post-season games.|$|E
5|$|At a young age, Anderson {{admired the}} European {{aspects of the}} game. He was known to have a liking for {{participating}} in international tournaments, more so than his NHL contemporaries. When he was drafted by <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> in 1979, he chose to play for Team Canada at the 1980 Winter Olympics instead of immediately joining <b>the</b> <b>Oilers.</b> Anderson won gold at the 1984 and the 1987 Canada Cup {{and he was a}} silver medalist at the 1989 Ice Hockey World Championships. During his NHL career, Anderson was part of six Stanley Cup winning teams (he won five as a member of <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> and one {{as a member of the}} Rangers) and he was a participant at four All-Star Games. He is one of only seven Oilers players to have won all five Cups in franchise history. Anderson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 10, 2008 and his jersey number, 9, was retired by <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> on January 18, 2009.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1984–85 season, Anderson signed an eight-year contract with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers.</b> Anderson recorded 42 goals and 81 points and once more his team were the division champions. Anderson was also selected to play in the All-Star Game. For the third straight season, <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> reached the Finals. <b>The</b> <b>Oilers</b> defeated their opponent, the Philadelphia Flyers, in five games. Anderson set a career high in assists with 16 during the playoff run. The 1985–86 season saw Anderson score 54 goals, 48 assists, adding up to 102 points. This was the second time Anderson had reached the 50 goal plateau in his career and the third time he had reached the 100 point plateau. He was also selected to play in his third consecutive All-Star Game. For the fifth consecutive season, <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> sat atop the Smythe Division. However, <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> were eliminated in the division finals by the Calgary Flames on an own goal by defenceman Steve Smith. The loss did not seem to faze Anderson and his team, as they won their third Cup the next season by beating the Flyers once again, but this time in seven games. Anderson set career highs in goals (14), points (27) and PIM (59) during the playoff run.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{shipping}} is {{the economic}} segment that most thoroughly retains {{the notion of}} <b>the</b> <b>oiler</b> as a separate position. On a merchant ship, an oiler is an unlicensed rate of the engineering department. The position is of the junior rate in the engine room of a ship. <b>The</b> <b>oiler</b> is senior only to a wiper. Once a sufficient amount of sea time is acquired, <b>the</b> <b>Oiler</b> can apply to take a series of courses/examinations to become certified as an engineer.|$|R
5|$|Glencross {{established}} himself as an NHL regular in 2007–08. He appeared in 36games for the Blue Jackets before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Dick Tarnstrom on February 1, 2008. Glencross appeared in 26games for <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> scoring 15goals and 25points in 61games combined between Columbus and Edmonton. Though he played well with Edmonton, <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> {{did not make a}} contract offer, making him an unrestricted free agent. Glencross hoped to remain in Edmonton as it was close to his Red Deer home. But after <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> made little effort to negotiate with him, he chose to sign a three-year, $3.6million deal with Edmonton's provincial rival, the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|In 1982–83, the Edmonton Oilers won {{the regular}} season championship. <b>The</b> <b>Oilers</b> were led by Wayne Gretzky, who {{remained}} with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> when they joined the NHL in 1979. He scored 137 points in 1979–80 and won the first of nine Hart Trophies as the NHL's most valuable player. Over the next several seasons, Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season, with 92 in the 1981–82 season; in assists, with 163 in the 1985–86; and in total points, with 215 in 1985–86. Gretzky also set the record for scoring 50 goals in the fewest number of games, achieving the mark in 39 games. The Islanders and Oilers met in the Finals as New York swept Edmonton for their last Stanley Cup. The following season, <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> and Islanders met again in the playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Oilers</b> won the rematch in five games, marking the start of another dynasty.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oilers</b> re-signed Brewer, {{who was a}} free agent, to a one-year, $907,500 {{contract}} in August 2001. In his second season with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> Brewer was assigned to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players by Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish. Brewer began to play more minutes in games, typically placing among the NHL leaders in average minutes played per game. With this enhanced role on the team, Brewer finished his season with new career highs in assists and points {{for the second consecutive}} season, and matched his career high in goals. Although his single year contract expired, his role on <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> had become more important and Brewer expected a large raise for his third season with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers.</b>|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> {{unwilling to}} pay {{what he was}} expecting, Brewer {{decided to go to}} salary {{arbitration}} to get a new contract. However, on August 4, 2004, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65 million contract with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later. Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|At the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, the Islanders traded Brewer, Josh Green {{and their}} second round {{selection}} (Brad Winchester) {{in the same}} draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík. Although surprised to be traded, Brewer was excited {{at the prospect of}} playing for <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> who saw Brewer as a top-four defenceman. However, Brewer's Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left hip and tailbone in his first game with the team. Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup. Brewer scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers. Brewer finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best plus/minus rating on <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> team, a plus-15. Further, Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience, a quarterfinal series versus the Dallas Stars. Brewer had six points, but <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the minesweeper's {{starboard}} 40-millimeter mount {{took the}} [...] "Frances" [...] under fire. At a point [...] above and [...] {{from the port}} quarter of the nearby , the [...] "Frances" [...] executed a wing-over and dived for <b>the</b> <b>oiler.</b> Vigilance's Bofors continued firing until the plane was just above Taluga, at which point she ceased firing for fear of hitting <b>the</b> <b>oiler.</b> <b>The</b> [...] "Frances" [...] crashed Taluga's [...] bow, administering a glancing blow to the ship and blew some of <b>the</b> <b>oiler's</b> crew overboard. Vigilance fished three Taluga sailors from the water, who all agreed with the minesweeper's observers that the ship's gunnery had proved accurate and effective in deflecting the suicide plane.|$|R

5|$|By 1986 the Flames landed {{forwards}} Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing {{second in}} the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers.</b> Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> in seven games—the only time that the Flames defeated <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> in a playoff series during the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} season with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> Brewer {{continued}} {{his role as}} a top defenceman. On November 22, 2003, Brewer was among the participants in the historic 2003 Heritage Classic ice hockey game versus the Montreal Canadiens at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. Brewer scored <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> first goal of the game in a 4–3 loss in front of a then record crowd of 57,167. Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the Chicago Blackhawks, Brewer recorded his one-hundredth career point. Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league. In the final year of his two-year contract, Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his 2001–02 NHL season, a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rymkus left {{football}} {{after his}} firing and accepted a regional public relations {{position with the}} Los Angeles-based Global Marine Exploration Company. After {{more than three years}} out of the sport, he returned to coaching and <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> when former Redskins teammate Hugh Taylor hired him as the team's offensive line coach. Rymkus stayed with the team for the 1965 season, resigning in January 1966. Despite his short tenure with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> Rymkus's was popular in Houston; over 250 people attended a dinner in his honor following his resignation.|$|E
5000|$|After {{refresher}} training, equipment inspection, {{and routine}} shipyard overhaul, Caliente prepared for another WestPac tour on 8 January 1968. In {{addition to her}} cargo of fuel and lubricants <b>the</b> <b>oiler</b> also took a load of ammunition for the fire support ships. After a stormy crossing to Pearl she replenished the [...] and Yorktown carrier groups before arriving at Subic Bay on 2 February. Following voyage repairs, and loading supplies, <b>the</b> <b>oiler</b> departed for a standard ten-day run to the gun line and back.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Anderson tallied 48 {{goals and}} 56 assists {{for a total}} of 104 points to help <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> remain atop their division. In the playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Anderson and his team were matched up against the Islanders who were looking for a fourth consecutive Stanley Cup victory. During the Finals, Anderson had several noted run-ins with Islanders goaltender Billy Smith. During game one, a slash on Anderson's knee earned Smith a two-minute slashing penalty.|$|E
5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|After Rykmus {{was fired}} when <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> started the 1961 season poorly, Houston won ten {{consecutive}} games under Wally Lemm. In {{one of those}} games, against the Titans of New York, Cannon set a professional football record with 373 all-purpose yards and scored five touchdowns. His 216 rushing yards in the game also set an AFL record. At {{the end of the}} season, he was the AFL's leading rusher with 948 yards and led the league in all-purpose yards. <b>The</b> <b>Oilers</b> repeated as AFL champions and Cannon again was the game's MVP, scoring the only touchdown. The Sporting News named him to the 1961 AFL All-League Team and he was invited to play in the 1961 AFL All-Star Game.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after dawn, ten kamikazes {{attacked}} her formation. One of them dove at <b>the</b> <b>oiler,</b> strafed her deck, {{and then made}} for her superstructure. The attacker careened off the ship's bridge and exploded through her forward well deck into a compartment adjacent to her tanks brimming with 300,000 gallons of aviation fuel. However, only 12 men were injured; and <b>the</b> <b>oiler</b> was soon back in action.|$|R

5|$|During {{his second}} NHL season, Eberle {{sustained}} a sprained knee after colliding with Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn {{during a game}} on January 7, 2012. At {{the time of the}} injury, Eberle was among the league's top scorers and six points behind the league's leader. Despite his success, he was left off the 2012 NHL All-Star Game roster, which was selected while he was sidelined. Several members within <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> organization were outspoken regarding the omission, including captain Shawn Horcoff and Head Coach Tom Renney, to which the League replied that Eberle would have been selected had he not been injured. By January 19, Eberle returned to <b>the</b> <b>Oilers</b> line-up after missing four games. Five days later, he was nonetheless named as an All-Star replacement for the injured Mikko Koivu. Eberle was selected to Team Chara as part of the All-Star Fantasy Draft and went on to record an assist in the squad's 12–9 win against Team Alfredsson. The following month, Eberle recorded his 100th career NHL point on February 21, 2012, with a goal and two assists in a 6–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished his second NHL season leading with a team-leading 34 goals, 42 assists and 76 points. Among league scorers, he ranked 16th in goals and points. <b>The</b> <b>Oilers</b> continued to struggle as a team, however, and finished 14th in the Western Conference with 32 wins and 74 points.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} with <b>the</b> <b>Oilers,</b> Anderson scored 417 goals, 489 assists, and 906 points, ranking him third, fourth, and fourth most {{respectively}} in franchise history.
