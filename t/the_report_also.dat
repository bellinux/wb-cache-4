5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed.

5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic {{standards}} by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information about, or when they did, by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a meaningful response. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> {{confirmed}} that the United States stockpiled nuclear weapons in Greenland until 1965, contradicting assurances by Danish foreign minister Niels Helveg Petersen that the weapons were in Greenland's airspace, but never on the ground.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> {{considered}} using specialised Vietnamese {{language skills}} {{as a means of}} gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it, citing that infiltration and clandestine anti-colonial techniques were rendering them irrelevant.

5|$|An Army report {{released}} in 2001 blamed {{the breakdown of}} the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.|$|E
5|$|Another {{report by}} the UN was {{released}} in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment” at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% of the detainees it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} of training and resources. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> noted {{concerns}} about the District's conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects.

5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{revealed that}} due to pilot error, inadequate deicing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, {{a large amount of}} ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after the jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to the runway. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.|$|E
5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error.

The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive {{if they have been}} working more than fourteen consecutive hours. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>also</b> identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log book keeping, and the lack of a contingency plan in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's.
