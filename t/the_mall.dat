5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Heather awakens at a shopping mall, having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint; she had been dreaming of being trapped in a demented amusement park, forced to follow roller coaster tracks in her flight from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster. Before she can leave <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> a private detective called Douglas Cartland confronts her, claiming to have information about her birth. Heather evades him and discovers that <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> is mostly abandoned except for monsters. She encounters Claudia, who hints about Heather's fate. Heather finds herself in the Otherworld version of <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> — monster-filled and decaying — and is eventually restored back to the original shopping mall where she encounters Douglas, who confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her. Heather leaves <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> and resolves to take the subway home. Having arrived at her residence, Heather discovers that her father has been killed by a monster under the orders of Claudia, who tells her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill and leaves.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> {{was already}} {{regularly}} plagued with leaks and water damage.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, leaks in <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> {{roof and}} mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> {{and back to}} the Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them in <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|E

Two years after Walmart's purchase of <b>the</b> land, <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> final tenant, Marcello's Pizza, was forced to close up their 28-year-old location. Lisa Pieper, {{one of the owners}} of Marcello's, stated that they [...] "had no choice but to close" [...] after Walmart refused to renew their tenant's lease.
