He still held Lochrutton on 18 April 1390, when the letter was repeated. Thomas remained provost of Maybole until at least 1401, and perhaps until his consecration as Bishop of Galloway in 1415. No-one else is known to have held the position of provost there until 1439, although this proves nothing as the evidence for such things in the south-west of Scotland in this period is always scarce.|$|E

The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956.

In Lucha Underground, Hennigan won {{the main event}} of the debut episode, {{as well as the}} first ladder match and steel cage match in the promotion's history. He is also the second Triple Crown Champion in the company's history, having held the Lucha Underground Championship, <b>the</b> <b>Gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gods Championship and the Lucha Underground Trios Championship once each. In AAA, he (with partners Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Brian Cage) won the 2016 Lucha Libre World Cup, and is currently the reigning AAA Mega Champion as well as a former AAA Latin American and AAA World Cruiserweight Champion (being the first in history to hold the three titles simultaneously).|$|E
5|$|Henry {{became a}} {{powerful}} patron of Stephen's; Henry probably chose {{to support him}} because Stephen {{was part of his}} extended family and a regional ally, yet not sufficiently wealthy or powerful in his own right to represent a threat to either the King or his heir, William Adelin. As a third surviving son, even of an influential regional family, Stephen still needed the support of a powerful patron such as the King to progress in life. With Henry's support, Stephen rapidly began to accumulate lands and possessions. Following the battle of Tinchebray in 1106, Henry confiscated the County of Mortain from William of Mortain, and the Honour of Eye, a large lordship previously owned by Robert Malet. In 1113, Stephen was granted both the title and the honour, although without the lands previously held by William in England. <b>The</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Honour of Lancaster also followed after it was confiscated by Henry from Roger the Poitevin. Stephen was also given lands in Alençon in southern Normandy by Henry, but the local Normans rebelled, seeking assistance from Fulk, the Count of Anjou. Stephen and his older brother Theobald were comprehensively beaten in the subsequent campaign, which culminated in the battle of Alençon, and the territories were not recovered.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{returned}} to England in 958 {{at the behest}} of his uncle, but Oda died before Oswald returned. Lacking a patron, Oswald turned to Oskytel, recently named Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald along with Oskytel travelled to Rome for Oskytel's pallium, but this story is only contained in a 12th-century Ramsey Abbey chronicle, so it may not be authentic. Even if he did not travel to Rome, Oswald was active in ecclesiastical affairs at York until Dunstan obtained Oswald's appointment to the see, or bishopric, of Worcester. He was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester in 961. Soon after his consecration, he persuaded Germanus to come back to England and made him head of a small religious community near Westbury-on-Trym. After the establishment of this group about 962, Oswald grew worried that because the monastery was located on lands owned by the see of Worcester, his successors in the see might disrupt the community. He was offered the site of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire by Æthelwine, son of Æthelstan Half-King, and Oswald established a monastery there about 971 that attracted most {{of the members of the}} community at Westbury. This foundation at Ramsey went on to become Ramsey Abbey. Ramsey was Oswald's most famous foundation, with its church dedicated in 974. Later, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury to come and teach at Ramsey. Oswald directed the affairs of Ramsey Abbey until his death, when the dean Eadnoth became the first abbot. He gave a magnificent Bible to Ramsey, which was important enough to merit a mention in Oswald's Life. Alongside <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, Oswald also contributed wall hangings and other textiles to the abbey.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} an {{idea that}} <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spirit can be imparted {{from one person to}} another person based on Romans 1 : 11 and 1 Timothy 4 : 14. The author’s thesis is that such a theology is unbiblical because it does not recog-nize <b>the</b> distinction between <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spirit and spiritual <b>gifts,</b> and claims that <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spirit can be imparted from one person to another. Also, the doctrine and practice <b>of</b> impartation violates <b>the</b> Reformation’s teaching about <b>the</b> priesthood <b>of</b> all believers because believers are encouraged to rely on people and not on God in order to receive something from God. In this way, particularly gifted individuals in the church are no longer intercessors or ves-sels which God uses to work in <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> other people, but they are elevated to <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> mediators which actually reflects the Roman Catholic doc-trine about saints and priests as mediators between God and people.
