50|$|After the Hercynian Orogeny, 4 km of {{sediment}} filled the rapidly subsiding Delaware and Midland <b>basins.</b> <b>The</b> Midland <b>basin</b> was filled by about 270 mya, as it received {{the majority of}} clastic sediment from the Hercynian Orogeny via a subaqueous delta, while <b>the</b> Delaware <b>Basin</b> continued to fill until the late Permian.
