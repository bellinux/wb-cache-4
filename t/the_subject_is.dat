5|$|The 3rd person {{singular}} and plural nominative forms, ngonggega and bogo, {{are labeled}} 'rare' {{because they are}} gradually becoming disused. Speakers prefer to use non-personal pronouns such as gayh- 'that' or gayh-gorden 'those'. Moreover, since the person and number of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> contained in the prefix of the verb, nominative free pronouns are often dropped.|$|E
5|$|There are two theories– the {{autochthonous}} (in situ) {{theory and}} the allochthonous (drift) theory– that attempt to explain the formation of coal balls, although <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> mostly speculation.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{experiment}} was to preliminarily confirm whether the related problem generated by our system could be effectively used in a study with RPS or not. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> eight university and graduate school students, whose main <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> informatics. All of them learnt chemistry in high school. It might <b>be</b> better if <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> high school students. However, IPSS is designed for reviewing after teachers, so <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> should have {{a certain level of}} knowledge in chemistry. In this sense, <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> tolerable.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> 32  years old, good {{general and}} oral health after an {{information}} session, where {{he signed a}} consent form. He was free of any dental pathology, masticatory disorder and displayed a normal occlusion. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> asked to put the whole sample in his mouth at once. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> <b>was</b> asked not to eat during at least 60  min before the experiment in order that hunger or the digestion stages do not influence his mastication behavior.|$|R
30|$|The subjects’ {{physiological}} signals {{were measured}} for 2  min in a relaxed {{state to be}} used as reference. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> randomly assigned to view the 2 D and 3 D emotional movie clips. Six of <b>the</b> 12 <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> shown <b>the</b> 3 D clips first and then 2 D clips. <b>The</b> remaining six <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> shown <b>the</b> 2 D clips first followed by the 3 D clips. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> asked to fill out the post-test subjective evaluation questionnaires.|$|R
5|$|Each {{summer the}} staff and some older pupils run a summer school, Young Malvern, which {{incorporates}} many sports, activities and learning experiences. Malvern College {{is one of the}} two schools in the country (the other being Dulwich College) to offer Debating in the curriculum and pupils participate in regional and national competitions including the Debating Matters competition and the Three Counties Tournament. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> compulsory at Foundation Year level.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if {{different from the}} subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} cost of insecticide resistance is significant, but published data on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> minimal. In 1994, total {{costs of the}} insecticide and crop losses in the US state of Michigan were $13.3 million, representing 13.7% of {{the total value of}} the crop. The estimate of the cost implication of insecticides and crop losses per hectare is $138–368. Long-term increased cost to the Michigan potato industry caused by insecticide resistance in Colorado potato beetle was estimated at $0.9 to $1.4 million each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{final section}} follows {{the subject as}} he prepares for the special event, with the Fab Five {{watching}} edited footage of his preparations and critiquing how well or how poorly he followed their advice. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> followed through the event itself, with the Five again performing a running commentary and the subject often expressing his deep gratitude to the Fab Five for their counsel. A final tip {{from each of the}} Fab Five, usually relating to one of the topics covered in the episode, plays just before the credits.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of polar coordinates {{as part of a}} formal coordinate system. The full history of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of Polar Coordinates. Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E
5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and shoes. In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> 97 {{undergraduate}} students from Washington University’s psychology subject pool, and they participated for either payment or course credit {{in groups of}} one to five. One of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>was</b> sleeping during <b>the</b> experiment and <b>was</b> replaced. <b>Subjects</b> <b>were</b> {{randomly assigned to one}} of the four confidence scales, with 24 subjects in each condition.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> {{asked to}} point, {{as closely as}} possible, the {{position}} of the right thumb tip with the left index finger while having the eyes closed. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> asked to perform this activity before and after each session to see if the use of the sixth finger device had any effect in the self-perception of <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A Proposition of Relation, {{beginning}} with [...] "All", asserts (as we already know) that [...] "All Members of <b>the</b> <b>Subject</b> <b>are</b> Members of <b>the</b> Predicate".

5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest {{can also provide}} clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E

5|$|A PIL {{was filed}} in the Karnataka High Court where in the {{petitioner}} requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple {{times in the past}} and were forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice B.V. Nagarathna dismissed the petition stating that <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government.|$|E
5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
30|$|On {{the day of}} surgery, <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> {{taken to}} <b>the</b> {{operating}} room and placed {{on the table in}} a supine position while a femoral nerve block was administered. Following administration, <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> assisted to a sitting position while spinal anesthetic <b>was</b> provided. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> returned to a supine position and the involved limb was prepared and draped, after which prophylactic antibiotics were administered. For the tourniquet group, the leg was exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was placed as high as possible on the thigh of the surgical leg, over cast padding, and inflated to 300  mmHg.|$|R
