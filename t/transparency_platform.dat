As such messages are cheap talk they do not affect the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game. In our experiment, however, we find collusive price choices when price messages are possible, especially when they are truthful.

40|$|Worms, {{which are}} autonomous, {{self-replicating}} malware that propagates through networks, {{can be divided}} into two categories: traditional worms, which are fully autonomous in seeking out new hosts and propagating, and mass-mailing worms, which rely on social engineering techniques and user intervention for propagation. A worm’s lifecycle can be described in four phases: initialization, payload activation, network propagation, and dormant. Each phase forms the basis of an attack, either against the victim’s machine or a separate entity. The severe economic and social consequences have prompted a significant amount of research into worm defense mechanisms. An examination of these mechanisms through the perspective of a network protocol stack illustrates two key points: 1) user education is the best defense against mass-mailing worms and their social engineering techniques, and 2) traditional worms can be dealt with at many different levels, but there are trade-offs between performance, <b>transparency,</b> <b>platform</b> dependence and availability. Despite the increased threat posed by worms, the root cause still remains the same, which is a good indication that current defense mechanisms will be effective against future worm attacks. i...|$|E

Included in this discussion are the way in which context information is automatically provided to policies to inform context-aware behaviour; the dynamic wrapper mechanism which isolates policies, provides transparency to software developers and silently handles run-time errors arising during dynamic configuration operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of transparency {{is widely regarded}} as a thermometer of the relation between the Council of the EU and the public at large.

This article asks how EU actors use Council <b>transparency</b> as a <b>platform</b> and for what reason. It approaches transparency as a policy that is developed in three arenas: the internal, the external political, and the external judicial arena. The article finds strong evidence in support of the view that the Council’s transparency policy {{played a central role in}} EU institutions’ attempt to advance their information ambitions. By strongly engaging with the issue of transparency particularly the European Parliament and its members succeeded at expanding their institutional information basis in an area where their political grip was traditionally at its weakest: the Foreign Affairs Council.

40|$|This {{research}} paper is examining how corporations {{can create a}} rhetorical construction of <b>transparency</b> on digital <b>platforms</b> {{in order to make}} their communication appear transparent during a crisis. Crisis communication theory and theories of rhetoric and transparency have been used in order to analyse the crises situations and the linguistic means used in crisis related messages. By using the methods of semiotics and digital rhetoric, an analytical framework was developed to be able to analyse the level of both the rhetorical construction of transparency as well as the actual transparency by identifying what information has been disclosed and what has been withheld. The two companies used for the analysis were Toyota and Samsung, who both experienced a crisis in 2016. It was found that the two companies used different strategies in their crisis communication, in which Toyota came across as the best prepared corporation in times of crises due to a clearer reaction, which was not changed. Both corporations managed to construct a level of transparency through their use of language, however, some information was found to have been withheld, causing the actual transparency to be of a lower degree than the constructed transparency. Thus, by using language in certain ways, corporations are able to convince their stakeholders that they are transparent while being able to withhold different information that could prove valuable to some groups of stakeholders. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a citizen consultation model (CICO) {{to support the}} citizen participation in the government discretionary decisionmaking process. The aim is not to hollow out discretionary power from officials, but to encourage citizens in putting forward discussions and argumentations to the government in order to lessen arbitrariness and promote the principle of openness and <b>transparency.</b> A participation <b>platform</b> of the CICO is presented and related works are discussed. 1. Administrative discretions Public administrative discretion refers {{to the degree of}} latitude or flexibility exercised by public administrators when making decisions or conducting any agency business [1]. As such, discretions {{can be viewed as a}} source for arbitrariness, unfairness, corruption or irrational outcomes and need to be eradicated. However, this paper argues that taking away discretions from the government might cause an official to ignore citizen-individualized circumstances and thereby overlook special needs of citizens. This paper suggests the open government concept coined by Nelson [2] to bring about transparency and openness in discretionary decision-making. Nelson defines the concept of ‘open government as “Participation contributes to open government, open government contributes to the need to justify official actions in terms of morally acceptable principles, and the need to justify contributes to better decisions. ” With the goal of eliminating the discretionary decision-making by whim, caprice, chance, or ritual, Galligan [3] introduces the concept of consultation as a mode of participation that connotes the presentation of arguments and proof in order to influence the way issues are to besettled. The decision-maker has a duty to hear and consider, but may decide for reasons which go beyond the submissions of the parties, and may act according to standards which are defined only broadly or settled only in the course of the decision.

Varietal innovation platforms aim to overcome this problem by ensuring that the viewpoints of people involved in assessments are representative of broad interest groups and that assessment results will be validated and disseminated by an organization. Each platform is designed as a sociotechnical scheme consisting of a five-member steering committee (SC), a club with a membership of 25 local users and experts (CLUE), a common varietal test plot and a network of around 15 - 20 on-farm plots. The aim is to describe, evaluate and disseminate improved varieties to target groups of stakeholders faced with the same environmental, agricultural and socioeconomic constraints. Partnerships between all of these stakeholders are set up, organized and managed according to six principles outlined in a charter—legitimacy, competence, efficiency, democracy, solidarity and <b>transparency.</b> Two experimental <b>platforms</b> were set up in the villages of Zé and Tori-Bossito, in southern Benin, to assess plantain varieties released by the Centre africain de recherche sur le bananier et le plantain (CARBAP).

The CLUEs identified four interesting varieties. The survey focused on the future plans made by SC and CLUE members to tap the benefits of knowledge acquired during 18 months. It showed that: (i) their plans provided conditions favorable for varietal dissemination and scaling, (ii) SC plans were based on transfer of the platform scheme whereas the CLUE plans were based on varietal dissemination, and (iii) the Tori plan was collective while the Zé plan was more individually focused. Our analysis highlighted that the respect of the legitimacy, skill and solidarity principles was most required to expect successful dissemination of the results obtained on the platforms...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{growth in}} {{nanotechnology}} has been accelerating {{the identification and}} evaluation of new drug candidates. The development, optimization of nanomedicine and preclinical drug screening is critical but long and expensive. These studies are challenging {{due to the lack}} of test platforms that can incorporate sufficient human-relevant physiological complexity for reliable and standardized prediction. Current preclinical models based on animals are expensive and has poor predictivity due to the variety of animals and limitation of imaging technologies. Two-dimensional (2 D) cell cultures used in the preclinical phase drug screening cannot adequately restore original cellular behaviors to nanomedicine in three-dimensional (3 D) tissues. 3 D cell culture models with the ability to independently manipulate microenvironmental factors can be used as a platform, to explore fundamental biological response to novel therapeutic nanoparticles. Transport of nanomedicine through solid tumors can be adequately evaluated in specially prepared 3 D cell culture as platform. This is important for validating drug doses and administration regimens required to achieve desired therapeutic effects. In coupling with Monte-Carlo sampling and analysis of conditioned microenvironment, the standardized and uniform-sized liver tumor spheroids culture model in Inverted Colloidal Crystal (ICC) scaffolds can be used to quantitatively identify or validate predictive nanoparticle (NP) transport, while <b>transparency</b> of the <b>platform</b> allowed convenient real-time monitoring with high resolution. This dissertation established the experimental and conceptual framework for quantitative evaluation of NP transport in the tumor tissue ex vivo as a part of drug discovery, and explored a new opportunity of carbon nanotubes as a promising nano-sized carrier for drug delivery. Beside, this platform has been improved to develop patient/disease-specific model for individualized study of drug safety and efficacy or drug–drug interactions with 3 D stem cell culture. In this part of dissertation, ICC scaffolds with uniform, controllable porous structure combined with a layer-by-layer (LBL) bone mimetic modification technique served as a platform for engineered stem cells. Overall, this dissertation introduces a promising and standardized 3 D cell culture platform as a window to fundamental understanding of nanomedicine, as well as a practical and valuable tool for drug discovery regarding drug delivery and transport through complex 3 D tissues...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{software}} {{systems are}} becoming increasingly integrated and are required to operate over organizational boundaries through networks. The development of such distributed software systems has been shaped by the orthogonal trends of service-orientation and process-awareness. These trends put an emphasis on technological neutrality, loose coupling, independence from the execution <b>platform,</b> and location <b>transparency.</b> Execution <b>platforms</b> supporting these trends provide context and cross-cutting functionality to applications and {{are referred to as}} engines. Applications and engines interface via language standards. The engine implements a standard. If an application is implemented in conformance to this standard, it can be executed on the engine. A primary motivation for the usage of standards is the portability of applications. Portability, the ability to move software among different execution platforms without the necessity for full or partial reengineering, protects from vendor lock-in and enables application migration to newer engines. The arrival of cloud computing has made it easy to provision new and scalable execution platforms. To enable easy platform changes, existing international standards for implementing service-oriented and process-aware software name the portability of standardized artifacts as an important goal. Moreover, they provide platform-independent serialization formats that enable the portable implementation of applications. Nevertheless, practice shows that service-oriented and process-aware applications today are limited with respect to their portability. The {{reason for this is that}} engines rarely implement a complete standard, but leave out parts or differ in the interpretation of the standard. As a consequence, even applications that claim to be portable by conforming to a standard might not be so. This thesis contributes to the development of portable service-oriented and process-aware software in two ways: Firstly, it provides evidence for the existence of portability issues and the insufficiency of standards for guaranteeing software portability. Secondly, it derives and validates a novel measurement framework for quantifying portability. We present a methodology for benchmarking the conformance of engines to a language standard and implement it in a fully automated benchmarking tool. Several test suites of conformance tests for two different languages, the Web Services Business Process Execution Language 2. 0 and the Business Process Model and Notation 2. 0, allow to uncover a variety of standard conformance issues in existing engines. This provides evidence that the standard-based portability of applications is a real issue. Based on these results, this thesis derives a measurement framework for portability. The framework is aligned to the ISO/IEC Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation method, the recent revision of the renowned ISO/IEC software quality model and measurement methodology. This quality model separates the software quality characteristic of portability into the subcharacteristics of installability, adaptability, and replaceability. Each of these characteristics forms one part of the measurement framework. This thesis targets each characteristic with a separate analysis, metrics derivation, evaluation, and validation. We discuss existing metrics from the body of literature and derive new extensions speciffically tailored to the evaluation of service-oriented and process-aware software. Proposed metrics are defined formally and validated theoretically using an informal and a formal validation framework. Furthermore, the computation of the metrics has been prototypically implemented. This implementation is used to evaluate metrics performance in experiments based on large scale software libraries obtained from public open source software repositories. In summary, this thesis provides evidence that contemporary standards and their implementations are not sufficient for enabling the portability of process-aware and service-oriented applications. Furthermore, it proposes, validates, and practically evaluates a framework for measuring portability...|$|R
40|$|We have witneseed great advances, {{during the}} last decade, in two ares of {{computing}} which are of interest for this thesis: 1) Open Distributed Processing (ODP) and 2) hardware performance increases [...] which allow regular personal computers to function as powerful multimedia processing units. ODP, {{also referred to as}} Object-Oriented Middleware, offers benefits like location, hardware, operating-system and programming language <b>transparency,</b> but ODP <b>platforms</b> are naturally unfitted to handle multimedia data because of its continuos (streaming) nature and because it often comes in large quatities. As part of the research done in the last years to find ways to combine these two computing areas, we propose the implementation of a Multimedia Stream Adapter for Object-Oriented Middleware (MSA). The purpose of our MSA is to extend the native capabilitites of ODP platforms, which is the implementation of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) paradigm, with support for the concept of streaming. In particular, {{we want to be able}} to treat streams of data as regualar (C++) first-class objects within a program. Among the existing ODP platforms we have only considered CORBA and the Internet Communication Engine (ICE), developed by ZeroC. Inc., see www. zeroc. com, which are Open Source platforms. Among these two, we have chosen to implement our solution with ICE because 1) many CORBA implementations have been abandoned {{during the last}} years, and there has been a decline in the interest to address the misfeatures of the CORBA specification by the Object Management Group (OMG) and 2) because CORBA is extremely complex and very difficult to become proficient with. ICE has been developed by experienced CORBA programmers and provides a much simpler object model, which still is very powerful. At the time of this writting, ICE has reached a level of maturity which warrants its use as a viable platform for both research and production systems. ICE uses an interface definiton language called Slice, similar in purpose to CORBA's IDL. In this thesis we have implemented a compiler for a slightly extended version of the Flow Interface Definition Language (FIDL), developed at the University of Tromsø, called FIDL++, which allows the programmer to describe streams and flows of data by means of QoS parameters. By means of this compiler we generate Slice and C++ code which, when compiled, provides us with a set of objects which together implement the functionality of a stream of data. A streaming API is provided, via one of the objects, thus offering a single point of control of the stream of data. We describe the run-time of MSA based applications and we present a demo application. We also provide a description of the process of how to build MSA based applications. Because this thesis was, to begin with, part of the MULTE-ORB project, developed as a cooperative effort between the Center of Technology at Kjeller and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oslo, we have also provided an implementation of a Da CaPo core.
