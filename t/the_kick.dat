5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>kick</b> through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed {{because of the lack of}} an offside rule. The job of the man playing in <b>the</b> <b>kick</b> through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal and wait for a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs. Despite their name their job was to man mark <b>the</b> <b>kick</b> through.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>kick,</b> the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. <b>The</b> <b>kick</b> itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if <b>the</b> <b>kick</b> goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after <b>the</b> <b>kick.</b> If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of <b>the</b> <b>kick.</b> The opposing team can also return <b>the</b> <b>kick</b> if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E

At the Tech 15-yard line following the big gain, the Eagles lost one yard on a rushing play before Davis passed to Gunnell for a 16-yard gain and a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:29 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech's lead was cut to 14–7.|$|E
5|$|Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} a one-yard run later, Tech prepared to punt the ball away.

5|$|With the game's {{momentum}} now {{firmly in}} their favor, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Kansas' offense on three straight plays, forcing another Kansas punt. <b>The</b> <b>kick</b> traveled 62yards and was recovered at the Virginia Tech 18-yard line. Virginia Tech's offense, despite the poor field position, moved quickly, {{partly due to}} a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Kansas. Sean Glennon completed a controversial 37-yard pass to tight end Greg Boone to drive the Hokies deep into Kansas territory. Initially, the pass {{appeared to have been}} intercepted by a Kansas defender, but subsequent replays revealed that Boone had wrested possession of the ball away from the defender. Three rushes deep inside the Kansas red zone netted the Hokies just nine more yards, setting up a fourth-and-one scenario for the Virginia Tech offense. Rather than risk a failed fourth-down conversion, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in kicker Jud Dunlevy to attempt a 25-yard field goal. During <b>the</b> <b>kick,</b> however, Kansas defender Joe Mortensen rushed through the Virginia Tech line and blocked <b>the</b> <b>kick,</b> denying the Hokies three points and preserving a 1714 Kansas lead with 6:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

30|$|A {{previous}} study {{has shown that}} kick power, as such the loading to muscles, are highly related to muscle lengthening speed and muscle contraction time (Shan et al. 2005).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} joint kinematics of <b>the</b> <b>kicking</b> leg in Taekwondo and to examine the role of inter-joint coordination of the leg in producing <b>the</b> <b>kicking</b> velocity. A new inter-joint coordination index that encompasses three- dimensional hip and knee motions, was defined and applied to the joint kinematic results. Twelve elite Taekwondo athletes participated in this study and performed <b>the</b> back <b>kick,</b> thrashing kick, turning-back kick and roundhouse kick. Our results indicate that <b>the</b> back <b>kick</b> utilized a combination of hip and knee extension to produce <b>the</b> <b>kicking</b> velocity, and was characterized by a pushlike movement. <b>The</b> thrashing <b>kick</b> and turning-back kick utilized a greater degree of hip abduction than <b>the</b> roundhouse <b>kick</b> and back kick, and included complicated knee motions. The new index successfully categorized <b>the</b> thrashing <b>kick</b> and turning-back kick into a push-throw continuum, indicating a change from negative index (opposite direction) to positive index (same direction) of hip and knee motions at the end of the movement.

5|$|After the missed kick, Cincinnati's offense took to {{the field}} at their 20-yard line.

Tech punted back to Cincinnati, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. The first play of the drive resulted in a short loss, but on the second play, Pike completed a 39-yard pass to Gilyard. The play advanced the Bearcats deep into Virginia Tech territory and gave them a first down. Despite the long play, Cincinnati was unable to gain another first down, and Rogers entered the game to attempt a 44-yard field goal. <b>The</b> <b>kick</b> was partially blocked and fell short, denying the Bearcats three points.

5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball off the kickoff {{on their own}} 28-yard line. Losing eightyards on their threeplays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut.

5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of <b>the</b> <b>kick,</b> the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block <b>the</b> <b>kick,</b> allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{a penalty}} <b>kick,</b> <b>the</b> goalkeeper is {{required}} only to stay 5 metres from the spot of <b>the</b> free <b>kick</b> {{and does not}} have to stay on the goal line until <b>the</b> ball is <b>kicked.</b> <b>The</b> player <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball must also shoot at the goal and all other players must stay behind the ball until <b>the</b> ball is <b>kicked.</b>|$|R

The Hokie offense was no more successful than Indiana's had been, and Tech punted after going three and out. Following <b>the</b> <b>kick</b> and a short return, the Hoosiers began work at their 41-yard line. After being stopped for no gain on two consecutive plays, Paci completed a long pass to Tech's 40-yard line for the Hoosiers' first first down of the second half. Indiana continued advancing the ball via short passes, but came up oneyard short of a first down. Instead of punting on fourth down, Indiana attempted to gain the first down via a rush up the middle. Tech's defense held fast, and Indiana turned the ball over after failing to gain the needed yard.|$|E
