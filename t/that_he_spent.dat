5|$|Bomar {{was born}} on January 21, 1901, in Bell Buckle, Tennessee to Oliver Eugene Bomar, a blacksmith, and Elizabeth May McAdams. Vanderbilt records {{indicate}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> part of his youth in Gallatin. Bomar attended Webb School in his native Bell Buckle, and spent a year at Castle Heights Military Academy.|$|E
5|$|Bryan arrived {{quietly and}} took rooms at a modest hotel; the Nebraskan later {{calculated}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> less than $100 while in Chicago. He arrived {{convinced that he}} would win the nomination. He had already begun work on a speech. On the evening of July 5, Bryan was visited by a delegation of Coloradans, seeking his support for Senator Teller. They went away apologetically, not having known Bryan sought the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Conran {{spent four}} years making {{a black and white}} teaser with a bluescreen set up in his living room and using a Macintosh IIci. He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so {{impressed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was interested in Sky Captain, but Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal.|$|E
50|$|Theo Realo, an {{eccentric}} researcher, approaches {{a psychologist at}} Arcturus university. His story is <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>spent</b> many years on an obscure out-of-the-way planet and has found evidence that it once formed part of a now-lost Galactic Federation, based on psychology far more advanced than that now known.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Phillepe It {{was known}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> already <b>spent</b> the $50,000 when Furio came to confront him.|$|R

5|$|Jackalow {{was still}} incarcerated in the Essex County Jail on July 21. A {{reporter}} from the Newark Daily Advertiser visited Jackalow {{and found him}} to be intelligent, noting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> most of his time reading but was not proficient in spoken English. Jackalow protested his innocence to the reporter and explained that he was Japanese, from the Ryukyu Islands.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Lafayette was an {{exponent}} of {{the ideals}} of the Age of Enlightenment, especially on human rights and civic nationalism. Despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> most of his political career in opposition, his views were taken very seriously by intellectuals and others {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Forster {{earned his}} first {{professional}} contract with Newcastle United, signing for their Academy in 2005. Forster was Newcastle's third choice goalkeeper in the 2007–08 season while Tim Krul was on loan at Falkirk, and played {{regularly in the}} reserves. However, in the six years he was signed to the club, Fraser never made a first-team appearance for Newcastle, mainly {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> most of his time on loan to other clubs, often lasting entire seasons.|$|E
50|$|From Belgium he {{continued}} his training in Gardone Val Trompia where <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> time in different workshops with such masters as Ceasare Giovanelli and Gianfranco Pedersoli. During his stay in Italy he met the Master Julio Timpini, from Beretta, Giacomo Fausti and Giovanni Steduto both now of Creative Art. Geoffroy Gournet was so eager to master all the techniques of bulino <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spents</b> 7 days a week practicing. Phil Coggan and Gary Merle were also students there {{at the same time}} as Geoffroy.|$|R
50|$|In 1856, Thomas de Colmar {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>spent</b> 300,000 francs of his {{own money}} during the thirty years <b>that</b> <b>he</b> perfected his invention.|$|R
50|$|Warren was Geelong's third leading goal-kicker in 1925 with 24 {{goals and}} was a rover in their premiership team <b>that</b> year. <b>He</b> <b>spent</b> three more seasons at Geelong.|$|R
5|$|In late May 2007, {{following}} the FBI raid, questions surfaced {{about whether or}} not Jew actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not Jew therefore met the residency requirements of his supervisor position. The house in question (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said that the house was vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity. Jew claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> most of his time at his flower shop, but was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests.|$|E
5|$|Pilot Gerhard Goebel {{was able}} to calm Demeke down during the {{non-stop}} flight to New York. Though Demeke kept the pistol pointed at Goebel's head {{for the duration of}} the flight, he removed his ski mask. Goebel later told newspapers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> the hours trying to build a rapport with Demeke, who admitted to having spent several months planning the hijacking. Both men agreed that, upon arriving in New York, Goebel would give Demeke his sunglasses in exchange for Demeke's pistol.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter Asser {{seems to}} have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> {{a good deal of}} time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E
50|$|During 1716 to 1718, Fauchard gained great prestige. During <b>that</b> time <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> {{long periods}} {{away from home}} {{studying}} and sharing his medical practice with other surgeons across France.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s {{he was a}} {{prominent}} member of the Tupamaros. For <b>that</b> reason <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> 13 years in jail during the civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay.|$|R
50|$|Andrus did not {{witness the}} executions himself, as <b>he</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>spent</b> {{too much time}} with the prisoners to watch them die.|$|R
5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the Browns drafting Clifford Charlton and Junkin's desire to move back inside, the Browns planned to move him back to inside linebacker for the 1988 season. He spent training camp competing with Eddie Johnson for the second inside linebacker position alongside Mike Johnson, {{and by the end of}} preseason play, Junkin had won the starting job. In his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs, Junkin had six tackles, including the first one of the game in a 6–3 Browns win. A month later, Junkin injured his knee, and was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> the next few weeks as the backup inside linebacker. He was given the starting job again to end the season, but missed tackles and a lack of impact plays led to his second season being considered a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Lang filmed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{at the end}} of 1932 and the {{beginning}} of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene during a power outage, a stunt actor did the gun play. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> most of the production in a state of panic due to the way Lang would endanger his crew. The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in interviews that if he could re-do the film, he would not have included these supernatural scenes.|$|E

5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E
5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|William {{took over}} an English {{government}} {{that was more}} complex than the Norman system. England was divided into shires or counties, which were further divided into either hundreds or wapentakes. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman viscount. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue. To oversee his expanded domain, William was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed {{back and forth between the}} continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. William spent most of his time in England between the Battle of Hastings and 1072, and after <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spent</b> the majority of his time in Normandy. Government was still centred on William's household; when he was in one part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually this was a member of William's close family– frequently his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.|$|E
