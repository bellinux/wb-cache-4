5000|$|Migration {{encompasses}} four related concepts: persistent straight movement; {{relocation of}} an individual on a greater scale (both spatially and temporally) than its normal daily activities; seasonal <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movement</b> of a population between two areas; and movement leading to the redistribution of individuals within a population.

Methods Out of 103 patients who received CE between January 2004 and July 2006, 82 patients (33 female, mean age of 50. 6 years) were retrospectively analyzed for capsular movement; 21 patients were excluded because of the history of medications and previous surgeries. CE images were interpreted by a single investigator in relation to the GET and types of antro-pyloric capsular movement. Results Antro-pyloric capsular movement was classified into four patterns: type 1, large longitudinal <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movements</b> in the antrum followed by passage through the pylorus without resistance; type 2, after large longitudinal <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movements,</b> passage through the pylorus with resistance (> 1 minute); type 3, mixed pattern of type 1 and 4; type 4, weak movement.

The {{aim of this study}} is to identify risk factors associated with EUS-FNA. In this multicenter case-control study, we retrospectively reviewed 4, 097 cases between 2009 and 2012 at 15 hospitals in Korea. Among the patients there were 104 cases (2. 5 %) who had adverse events of which 12 (0. 29 %) were severe.

The most common adverse events were pancreatitis (45 / 104, 43. 3 %) and infection (46 / 104, 44. 2 %). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on the same day was a risk factor of all adverse events [OR = 2. 41, 95 % CI (1. 41, 4. 12) ], pancreatitis [OR = 2. 31, 95 % CI (1. 02, 5. 25) ], and infection [OR = 2. 75, 95 % CI (1. 31, 5. 78) ].

The effects of needle gauge on diagnostic outcomes of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) of pancreatic mass lesions remain unknown. This study compared procurement rates of histologic cores obtained from EUS-FNB of pancreatic masses using 25 - and 22 -gauge core biopsy needles. From March 2014 to July 2014, 66 patients with solid pancreatic mass underwent EUS-FNB with both 25 - and 22 -gauge core biopsy needles. Among them, 10 patients were excluded and thus 56 patients were eligible for the analyses. Needle sequences were randomly assigned, and two passes were made with each needle, consisting of 10 uniform <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movements</b> on each pass with 10 mL syringe suction. A pathologist blinded to needle sequence evaluated specimens {{for the presence of}} histologic core. The mean patient age was 65. 8 ± 9. 5 years (range, 44 - 89 years); 35 patients (62. 5 %) were men. The mean pancreatic mass size was 35. 3 ± 17. 1 mm (range 14 - 122. 3 mm).

40|$|Reanimating the archaic {{thinking}} of Heraclitus, Kostas Axelos thought that play animates the world. Yet, {{the interplay between}} the play {{of the world and}} animation remains underthought. Instead, the digital animator unthoughtfully presses play on the display to display play. While pressing play on the digital display greatly enfolds digital animation technology, it remains underthought in relation to the unpressable play of the world. This project-based research addresses this tension through asking: How can a digital technologist think and make digital animation play? The research collects an animated etymology of digital animation from thoughtful erring: the play of psychophysiological <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movement.</b> As a digital animation technologist, I make and think digital animation originating from the physical &ndash; enclosing the psychical &ndash; play of <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movement.</b> Deriving the play of the world from physis allows contextualising digital displaying through physical, metaphysical and pataphysical notions of play. The findings support that pressing play already steers the digital animation display. This forgets the enfolding unpressable play of the physical. Thinking and making digital animation play is either redundant or unthinkable. The discussion proposes the tension of digitism and playtime. Digitism is digital errance, which unthoughtfully errs in displaying play. Playtime thoughtfully errs in paying attention to the physical tensions at play: moving to and fro. The (un) final project, Unanimation, pays attention to this tension as total fragments collected from thoughtful erring. When played, it plays forwards as it plays backwards joining the true and the false display. To question displaying play that presses forward, the project does not play through pressing play.

40|$|Consistent {{preferences}} for particular types of movement suggest criteria for movement selection. These can be important when, as {{is usually the}} case, infinitely many movements allow a task to be achieved. The experiments reported here were designed to identify {{the source of a}} strong preference observed in earlier object-manipulation studies. In those earlier studies, subjects usually grabbed objects to be moved from one location to another in a way that afforded a comfortable final posture rather than a comfortable initial posture (the end-state comfort effect). The comfortable final state usually allowed the forearm to be at or near the middle of its range of motion on the pronation-supination dimension. The hypothesis tested here was that the end-state comfort effect stemmed from an expectation that movements can be made more quickly {{in the middle of the}} pronation-supination range than at either extreme. To test this hypothesis, we asked subjects, in the first experiment, to perform a handle rotation task that demanded little or no precision and so no need to make rapid <b>to-and-fro</b> homing-in <b>movements</b> near the end of the rotation. Half the subjects did not show the end-state comfort effect, in contrast to all previous studies, where all subjects showed the effect. An incidental finding of the first experiment was that handle rotations that ended at or near the end of the range of motion took longer than handle rotations that ended at or near the middle of the range of motion. To test the latter result more carefully, we asked subjects, in Experiments 2 and 3, to oscillate the forearm as quickly as possible, either in the supination part of the forearm rotation range, in the middle part of the range, or in the pronation part of the range. As predicted, oscillation frequencies were highest in midrange, and this was true for both hands. The results as a whole have implications for the relation between cognitive psychology and biomechanics, and for human factors. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} of the {{functional}} aspects of a complex behavioural system I have looked at three {{different aspects of the}} feeding behaviour of the Oystercatcher. I started by analysing the skilled feeding techniques of the adults, but I soon became interested in the development of these techniques in the young, and in the parental feeding system which is surprisingly different from that of other waders. It forms the 'buffer' between the adults and the young and allows the young to acquire the specialised feeding techniques and skills of their parents. Part I I discuss the parental feeding system first because the analysis has focused on a slightly different aspect of the feeding behaviour, namely {{the way in which the}} amount of food brought to the young by the parents is precisely controlled by the behaviour of the young. The parental feeding system has two basic characteristics: (a) the parents bring food items to the young and present them, and the young take the food from the parent's bill; and (b) the young accompany their parents out onto the feeding grounds and are fed by them in long 'feeding trains'. The seasonal development of parental feeding starts with the auditory and tactile interactions between the incubating parent and the hatching eggs. Both parents and young-in-egg become more responsive to each other as hatching proceeds, and both show a marked selective responsiveness. These pre-hatch interactions lead to the transition from incubation to brooding behaviour in the parent, and finally result in the onset of parental feeding. There is the additional possibility that the young learn to respond to the call of their parents while still in the egg. I then discuss the factors which control the amount of food brought by the parents to the young. In the active phases of the daily feeding cycle, each parent brings food items to the young at random moments in time. Once the food has been presented, the subsequent behaviour of the parent depends upon the speed with which the young seizes and devours the food. If the young takes the food within a certain time (the Waiting-Time-Threshold) the parent will immediately search for and present more food, and it will continue to do this for as long as the young takes the food within the threshold time. In this way the long 'feeding trains' are initiated and maintained. However, the young can also initiate a feeding train by approaching a parent who is feeding. The feeding train is broken off by the parent as soon as the young fails to react within the threshold time. This self-regulating social system is based on complex and highly specialised interactions between the parents and the young. As the young grow older the organisation of parental feeding changes drastically. The parents initiate fewer feeding trains, they carry less food to the young and, instead of removing the flesh from prey and then presenting it to the young, they begin to leave the prey for the young to open up and clean out. The young however play a more and more important role in the initiation and maintenance of the feeding trains. This switch of control to the young eventually leads to the breakdown of parental feeding, for, as the young learn to feed themselves, they stop eliciting parental feeding. The consequence of this system is that in areas where the young merely have to acquire the simple skills of probing for worms, parental feeding stops at about 6 – 7 weeks. However, in areas where the young are learning the more difficult skills for dealing with molluscs and crustacea, parental feeding continues for 12 – 20 weeks, and in extreme cases for as long as 43 weeks. Part II and III I here describe the techniques employed by adult Oystercatchers in dealing with Mytilus, Cardium, Scrobicularia, Tapes, Littorina, Patella and Carcinus. Each of these techniques consists of a sequence of discrete motor patterns of which each has a different form and a different function. To take the feeding techniques on Mytilus as an example: either the Stab (a quick downwards lunge of the bill through the gaping valves) or Hammering (a series of hard blows aimed at the shell) serve to gain initial energy into the valve; Levering (side-to-side movements of the bill) and Prising (forcibly opening the mandibles) serve to force the valves wide apart; and Chiseling (rapid <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movements</b> of the bill) serves to cut the flesh loose from the valves. Each motor pattern is precisely oriented for maximum effect: the Stab is aimed between the posterior valve margins so that it severs the strong posterior adductor muscle when the bill enters (this disabling the mussel); the Hammering attack (for which the mussel is first oriented so that the flat ventral surface is uppermost) is aimed at this area which I have shown to be by far the weakest part of the shell; and the Chiseling movements are aimed at the largest attachments between the flesh and the shell, the smaller ones being broken when the main mass of the flesh is shaken free. I found that these motor patterns are applied to all the prey species mentioned, and that they have always the same general function. However, in each case the orientation of the motor patterns are specifically adjusted to the anatomy of the particular prey. For example, the Hammering attack is direct at the ventral valve margins of Mytilus; at the posterior, ventral or anterior valve margins of Cardium (all these valve margins are equally friable); at the lateral walls of Patella (which are most easily dislodged by a blow from this direction); and at the mouth of Carcinus (which kills the crab as well as making a hole in it.) I then analyse the organisation and control of the sequence and duration of the motor pattern. Firstly, each motor pattern is elicited by a different external stimulus. Second, the duration of the motor patterns is likewise under continuous external control; for example, the duration of Levering in Cardium depends solely upon the size of the prey, i. e. in functional terms, to the amount of Levering that is needed to force the valves apart. Thirdly, the sequence in which the motor patterns occur are seen to be simple chain responses in which the performance of one motor pattern brings about the external stimuli necessary to elicit the next. It is this total dependence on external control which imparts a remarkable flexibility, and thus efficiency and economy of effort to the techniques, for each motor pattern is performed only if and when necessary, and only for as long as is necessary. The skill, efficiency and versatility of the adult techniques are due to two basic factors: firstly, a basic repertoire of motor patterns each adapted to a very generalised function; and secondly, their dependence on external stimuli, which allows (a) the precise adjustment of the orientation of each motor pattern to the anatomy of any one prey, and (b) flexibility in the initiation, duration and sequential organisation of the motor patterns. Very surprisingly, there is good evidence that individual Oystercatchers specialise not only on one particular prey but even on one particular technique of catching it. For example, the breeding population of Ravenglass (in Cumberland) is made up of individuals who eat crabs. Furthermore, in each breeding pair both partners have the same specialisation. There are a number of both casual and functional reasons for this specialisation, most of which are bound up with the development of the techniques in the young Oystercatchers. Part IV The starting point for my study of the development of the feeding sills were the observations that the young of mussel-Stabbing parents, mussel-Hammering parents and crab-eating parents all develop the same feeding skills and techniques as their parents. I therefore cross-fostered the eggs of individually known pairs with different specialisations. In every case the young developed the specialisations of their foster parents. This meant that the young had the potential to develop a number of different techniques but that some environmental factor was channelling the developmental system, so that only one technique developed. This led to a study of (a) the basis of the flexibility in the developmental system, and (b) the ways in which the channelling was brought about so that only one technique developed, and I have tried to analyse these from both a functional and a causal viewpoint. I first discuss the Independent Feeding Activities (IFA) of young Oystercatchers. These are shown from a few hours after hatching, and they are easily recognised as incipient forms of the adult feeding behaviour. A full repertoire of discrete motor patterns, all similar to the motor patterns of the adults, is present in all Oystercatcher young, irrespective of the specialisations of their parents and irrespective (within the range observed) of the environment in which they are growing up. The IFA are directed initially at a wide range of objects (both edible and inedible alike), and the stimuli that elicit them are very similar to those that elicit the same motor patterns in the adults. During IFA the young gain experience with the prey species (in this study with mussels or crabs – depending on the specialisations of the parents). The opportunities to experience are the following: (a) the young remove scraps of flesh from the shells discarded by the parents, (b) the young open up and empty out partially prepared prey which the parents leave for them, (c) when the young accompany their parents onto the feeding grounds they constantly see prey being caught and opened in their immediate presence, and (d) there are numerous undisturbed prey on the feeding grounds which the young attempt to catch and open up for themselves. The actual learning processes that take place are shown to be of at least three different types: the first interactions with the prey are seen when the small young (2 – 3 weeks of age) Chisel scraps of flesh from the discarded prey remains; subsequently, the young spend more and more time in investigating the prey remains. Experiments with hand-raised young (which were given experience of mussel shells containing flesh) showed that neither finding food in mussels by itself, nor Chiseling in mussels without a food reward, nor even performing any other motor pattern than Chiseling – with or without a food reward – leads to conditioning to the mussel. The conditioning only occurs when the young have to Chisel and receive food as a result of Chiseling. This pre-requisite for conditioning has two important functional aspects: firstly, it ensures that the young will become conditioned only to potential prey rather than to any other object lying about, and secondly, the young will become conditioned to whatever prey the parent is feeding to it. We see here the first example of both the flexibility and the channelling of the developmental system. This experience with the discarded shells also leads to the initial development of Chiseling, and practice with the partly opened prey left by the parents leads to the further development of efficient Chiseling, as well as to the functional organisation of Levering, Prising and Chiseling, i. e. to the correct orientation and sequence of these motor patterns. Much of this change in behavioural organisation can be accounted for by trial-and-error learning, but I also suggest that other factors may lend directionality to such learning processes by biasing what is learned. The development of the hunting techniques (i. e., locating and Stabbing or Hammering mussels, and locating and opening crabs) seem to develop as a direct result of parental example. At 4 – 5 weeks of age (before the young have started to successfully catch and open prey for themselves) there are already marked differences in the hunting behaviour of the young of mussel-Stabbing parents, mussel-Hammering parents and crab-eating parents. Both the 'Stabbing' and 'Hammering' young show elements of both techniques, but the most frequent behaviours shown in each case are those of their parents' techniques. The 'crab' young at this age completely ignore the mussels and only hunt for and attempt to open crabs. Once the young start to successfully catch and open prey (at 6 – 7 weeks of age) they employ only the relevant hunting behaviour. I then discuss the developmental system from the viewpoint of a learning machine with pre-set programmed instructions. The Oystercatcher's 'programming' shows specific adaptations to (a) develop a skilled feeding technique yet (b) retain flexibility so that a number of different feeding skills may potentially be developed. The instructions are therefore of a very general nature when compared with the instructions of developmental systems where the environment is more 'predictable'. I also discuss the coadaptation between the parental feeding system and the requirements of the developmental system. Firstly, the parent is instrumental in channelling the developmental system of the young; secondly, there are changes in the organisation of parental feeding as the young grow older which result in the parent leaving the partially opened prey which the young require for practice; and thirdly, I discuss the evolution of parental feeding as a necessary coadaptation to the evolution of a highly specialised feeding behaviour which the young have to acquire at an early age. Finally, I consider some broader ecological aspects of the development of the feeding skills. The first important point is that the young take at least three years to become fully efficient at eating mussels, and I argue that other feeding techniques will probably take as long to become fully efficient. There are a number of ecological consequences to this protracted development. Firstly, Oystercatchers do not breed until they are three, and usually four years of age, and I suggest that this is an evolutionary adaptation to the prolonged development. Secondly, during the prolonged development it would be disadvantageous to attempt to acquire a new technique, for the feeding behaviour would become even more inefficient. By the time that the one technique has become fully efficient, the bird may have to be so fixated on one particular prey and one particular technique that it will not respond to the relevant stimuli from other prey. This may be the basis of the persistent specialisations shown by adult Oystercatchers. However, some individuals (about 20 %) do possess more than one skilled technique, and perhaps they can switch through essentially the same processes that young Oystercatchers employ when learning from their parents. It may, therefore, be of advantage even for adults to retain a certain degree of flexibility. </p...|$|R
40|$|David Velleman, in {{his paper}} How {{we get along}} (2007), quotes Blackburn on a {{limitation}} of analytical moral philosophy in respect of ï¿½the social as a determining feature of individual action and motivationï¿½ (Ruling Passions, 1998). This is {{in accordance with the}} phenomenon that a positionï¿½s strengths are generally much the same as its supposed weaknesses: to proceed in analytic fashion, in moral philosophy as elsewhere, is to focus on the particular, the dissolving or breaking-down of issues (Greek: analuein). This strength on the part of analytic philosophy tends to discourage the question of the social (as a subset, we could say, of all holistic questions, and such phenomena as existentialism, gestalt psychology etc). In this respect, we may consider that the question of the identity of the individual, particularly in respect of technology and new media, is not only one which lends itself effectively to an analytic approach (given the structural consonance between the particular and the individual), but that this question will only have become both possible and significant in the modern era, post-Descartes. In other words, we posit a feedback mechanism, a <b>movement</b> <b>to-and-fro,</b> operating through time, history and tradition, between philosophy, the possibilities it opens up, {{and the ways in which}} society ï¿½expressesï¿½ itself (via politics, law, institutions, technology), its concerns and its members. Now, within the analytical philosophy of this movement, the social does not at all disappear; rather, its analysis is generally and necessarily located after the positing and analysis of the individual and the particular. Thus the importance of disciplines such as psychology, that is, disciplines which, on the basis of the particular, look at connections between those particulars. For instance, David Shoemaker will state (in Reductionist Contractualism 2000), ï¿½I have very good reasonsï¿½. for cultivatingï¿½ justifiability to all other selves with whom I am psychologically connected, given that they are, in a very real sense, extensions of me. ï¿½ Here, the self, the individual, comes first in the analysis, to be followed by the question of how this self becomes or is connected. By contrast, avowedly holistic and anti-Cartesian discourses such as existentialism (most notoriously, Heideggerï¿½s starting-point of Dasein) will tend to avoid positing individuals prior to ï¿½the wholeï¿½ (however this is characterised) and will therefore not include psychological issues within their ambit. Of course, in each case, the starting point will be in some way overturned; Dasein retains an inevitably individualistic tone; Shoemaker states elsewhere by means of modus tollens (in The Irrelevance/incoherence of non-reductionism about personal identity 2002) that ï¿½[i]t is not the case that questions of identity will always have determinate answers. Thus, we are not separately existing entities. ï¿½ This paper will suggest a systems approach to the question of ethics, the production of identity and the question of the ï¿½selfï¿½ in respect of information technology; this is, the issue of the feedbacks occurring between thought (in all its guises), the possibilities opened by it, technology, law and politics will be foregrounded. Digital computers and their associated databases, as particular phenomena, can only be established, improved and in themselves correctly understood by means of analytical research; this does not necessarily rule out a non-analytic approach in respect of their encompassing ï¿½ecologyï¿½. The systems-approach to the ecology of databases will in this paper have an eye to such post-Nietzschian thought as that of Deleuze (in Difference and Repetition) and Derrida (in Différance 1967), in the sense that both start from the idea and experience of difference from which any concept of identity or sameness will come to be derived. Identity is constructed, in a ecological and hyper-mobile system of thought, law, politics and information technology. How, alongside (not contra) other approaches, might this inherently ambiguous enterprise help clarify ethical issues? ï¿½	the specifics of individual cultures will be noted. Currently, the UK government is proceeding with development of a universal database of its residents, linked to an identity card supposedly guaranteed by biometric data (fingerprints, iris scansï¿½). In a country with no tradition of identity cards - the very suggestion has only been possible in an atmosphere of ï¿½war on terrorï¿½ - this endeavour has an ethical and political meaning different to other European states, and provides an example of how politicians can, by manipulating terminology (in this case, of ï¿½warï¿½, since the only precedent in the UK for identity cards was the second world war) achieve technical results ï¿½	similarly, the project of a universal UK health-care database, accessible in principle at all health-service locations and potentially by hundreds of thousands of individuals (including non-health-case professionals) is justified on broad technical grounds ï¿½ that is, the more efficient use of state healthcare funds and the better care of patients. It is becoming increasingly clear that any digital database is per se vulnerable to inappropriate revelation, viz the recent loss of CD-ROMs with financial and identity details of 7 million children from the UK tax authorities. Politicians claim incorrectly that this vulnerability is a technical question amenable to technical (IT security) solutions; in fact, it is an ecological (and thus properly political) question relating to the human-centred environment in which the data is used. It is therefore per se not possible to protect against such security breaches by means of a technical solution. But in respect of health-care information, the status of the press, the privacy laws governing what it can reveal (and therefore how it can make its money) vary from state to state (compare the UK with France) and thus the ethic import of the necessary possibility of such security breaches will tend to vary. Similarly in the interaction with other fields such as insurance The paper will hypothesise a structural (arguably ethical and political) law in respect of these issues. This law states that in order for the development of technologically-driven databases relating to citizens to proceed, the data collected must necessarily be ï¿½inoculatedï¿½, that is, made relatively innocuous compared to the dataï¿½s previous status in a particular society. Since IT security is no defense against the dataï¿½s release, there will inevitably be a tendency for the data to become or be made ï¿½worthlessï¿½ ï¿½ which will be a structural, not-get-roundable defense. This movement is already inherent and effective in the project of transparency, freedom of information, secularisation and emancipation of western social structures. It is only possible for a doctorï¿½s surgery to ask a patient their religion and record it in their database (as happens in the UK) if this information is relatively innocuous and does not lead to, say, persecution or prejudice against the individual. This goes for all data. The paper will conclude with a brief discussion of the possible consequences of this ï¿½lawï¿½ of inoculation/innocuation for politics, ethics and the status of the individual...|$|R

30|$|The {{experimentation}} on {{the steel}} bridge {{was carried out}} to study the disparity in the joint behavior of the downstream and upstream trusses of the steel bridge. Any variation in the expected behavior of the trusses can {{be due to a}} particular steel member being ineffective in taking the stress or the joint has lost its full rigidity and is transferring the load to other members with partial rigidity or the bearings are ineffective in transferring the load to the substructure. The experiment consists of measuring the forced and ambient vibrations generated with <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movement</b> of the vehicle. For each setup, the acceleration response at the vehicle passage with 10 and 30 km/h has been measured. The basis of the speed selection for the experiments was the possibility of minimum and maximum speed required on a particular bridge to see whether all the modes of the structure get excited or not. In the present study, it has been considered that the various factors such as speed of the vehicle, temperature, surface roughness, etc. have similar effect on the whole bridge and not specific to any particular node, though these factors will {{have an effect on the}} individual values of the results but get nullified when the relative variations are considered.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{imaginary}} of hawkers {{and traveling}} salesmen from Minas Gerais in {{the configuration of}} place, non-place and in between placeThis work studies the reconfiguration of space, specifically of place, non-place and in between place, of the hawkers and traveling salesmen {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais in Brazil. This is important to enable us to analyze new views about the job-private life duo, but in an inverse direction. What we call “inversion” is the externality of capital in the worker’s life. This reconfigures space through symbolic apprehensions outside organizations as well, replacing the self-constitution of their space by the hawkers and traveling salesmen through work. To this end, we used the elements of oral history and of imaginary structures interwoven in the symbolic universe. The findings indicate the existence of a <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movement,</b> in which the re-signification of work occurs by the adoption of new technologies, remodeling the relation between time and space. This is also sensitive to the reduction of privacy that is due to the controlling omnipresence of the firm. Moreover, the study found that the family sets the place and non-place boundaries in the affective relations, and it is also the main reason why hawkers and traveling salesmen choose to establish themselves in one place...|$|E

The first series involved one single stroke; the second, two strokes in the same direction; and the third, multiple strokes using a <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movement.</b> We analyzed the striations using a Hirox 3 D digital microscope (KH- 7700) and collected metric and profile data on the morphology of the cut marks.

Preliminary results show that both the tool type and the method of creating the cut mark influence the shape of the resulting groove. In our experiment, morphological parameters can be used to differentiate between marks produced using un-retouched flint flakes and those produced using burins. However, neither morphological nor morphometric analysis allows us to identify the mechanical motion used to produce the cuts, nor the state of the bone (fresh, boiled, or dry) at the moment of marking...|$|E

IN {{is one of three}} types of early-onset nystagmus that begin in infancy, alongside fusion maldevelopment nystagmus syndrome and spasmus nutans syndrome. Optometrists may also encounter patients with acquired nystagmus. The features of IN overlap largely with those of fusion maldevelopment nystagmus syndrome, spasmus nutans syndrome, and acquired nystagmus, yet the management for each subtype is different. Therefore, the optometrist’s role is to accurately discern IN from other forms of nystagmus and to manage accordingly. As IN is a lifelong condition, its presence not only affects the visual function of the individual but also their quality of life, both socially and psychologically. In this report, we focus on the approaches that involve optometrists in the investigation and management of patients with IN. Management includes the prescription of optical treatments, low-vision rehabilitation, and other interventions such as encouraging the use of the null zone and referral to support groups. Other treatments available via ophthalmologists are also briefly discussed in the article.

40|$|Theories of {{complexity}} have developed from various strands of twentieth century scientific endeavour, including general systems theory, chaos theory, ecology, quantum mechanics, and economics. These disciplines, and their maturity into {{a set of}} theories around complexity, undoubtedly constitute {{one of the more}} fertile rhizomes of positive science. Parallel to the sciences of the twentieth century, one fertile rhizome of non-positive thought has been that represented by continental philosophy, more or less indebted to Husserlï¿½s phenomenology and the opening of fundamental ontological questioning by Heidegger. This tradition of thought regards the sciences as regional, {{in the sense that they}} are characterised as dealing with a limited field of calculable positive knowledge, this being precisely their strength - and also their danger. This paper will argue that because of the potential and actual interrelations between these two rhizomes, theories of complex social systems are perhaps uniquely placed within the social sciences to take on board the critique of the positive intrinsic to the tradition of continental philosophy. The argument will be made that this is necessary if key questions which these theories face are to be given the required depth {{of complexity}} - such questions as how organisations can be effective and give space for essential human creativity; how to characterise the interrelations between the micro and macro levels of organisations, in particular recognising a <b>to-and-fro</b> <b>movement</b> which goes beyond cause-and-effect; and the possibility of justice within organisational and social systems...|$|E
