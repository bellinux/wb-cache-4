5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, {{which allow}} it to traverse the narrow alleyways common to the casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Having {{crossed into}} Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece, taking 3 months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme. It paused at Doriskos {{where it was}} joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> {{tactical}} units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Austria {{called for}} Prussia {{to hand over}} {{administration}} of Schleswig-Holstein, which had until that point been jointly administered by the two powers, to the Duke of Augustenberg. Prussia refused, and Otto von Bismarck sent <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> Austrian-administered Holstein. This provoked war between Austria and Prussia, with Hesse siding with the Austrians, technically making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E

The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies. Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 1990, Saddam Hussein sent an invading {{force of}} Iraqi <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> Kuwait. According to the United States {{government}} Hussein's forces would continue south into Saudi Arabia's oil fields. The United States military deployment to Saudi Arabia, Operation Desert Shield, grew rapidly {{to become the}} largest American deployment since the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|A lull ensued, {{during which}} November talks {{sponsored}} by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader Mengistu's attempt {{at the beginning of}} 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, {{having taken}} {{the measure of}} the enemy, threw his best <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E
5|$|Charles of Bavaria needed {{military}} assistance {{to take the}} imperial title by force, which he secured the treaty of Nymphenburg (July 1741). During the subsequent War of the Austrian Succession, he successfully captured Prague, where he was crowned King of Bohemia. He invaded Upper Austria, planning to capture Vienna, but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. His French allies redirected their <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> Bohemia, where Frederick the Great, himself newly King of Prussia, had {{taken advantage of the}} chaos in Austria and Bavaria to annex Silesia.|$|E
5|$|Early on May 6, three Royal Navy ships sailed into Quebec Harbour. Troops {{on these}} ships were {{immediately}} sent {{into the city}} and, not long after, General Guy Carleton formed them up and marched {{them out to the}} American siege camp. General John Thomas, then in command of the American forces, had already been making arrangements to retreat, but the British arrival threw his <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> a panic. He led a disorganized retreat that eventually reached Sorel on about May 18.|$|E

5|$|In September and October 1945 Europeans and pro-Dutch Eurasians were {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between the Republicans and the British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent more <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> the city from 10 November {{under the cover of}} air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.|$|E
5|$|In its engagements {{during the}} Perimeter battle, the KPA 13th Division, with 9,500 men, had forced South Korean <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> the Tabu-dong {{corridor}} and started advancing on Taegu. This division had battled the ROK 11th and 12th Regiments in the Yuhak-san {{area for a}} week before it broke through to the corridor on August 17. A regimental commander of the division said later it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process. On August 18, the 13th Division was concentrated mostly west of the road just north of Tabu-dong.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E

5|$|Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who {{had already}} {{tried and failed to}} draw Coalition <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> costly ground engagements by {{shelling}} Saudi positions and oil storage tanks and firing Scud surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, ordered the invasion of Saudi Arabia from southern Kuwait. The 1st and 5th Mechanized Divisions and 3rd Armored Division were ordered to conduct a multi-pronged invasion toward Khafji, engaging American, Saudi and Kuwaiti forces along the coastline.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment {{was formed}} at Ringway {{airfield}} near Manchester. Although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, {{it was also}} directed to investigate the use of gliders to transport <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> battle. At the same time, the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Limited to design and produce a glider for this purpose. The result was the General Aircraft Hotspur, an aircraft capable of transporting eight soldiers, that was used for both assault and training purposes.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa.

On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy <b>troops</b> <b>into</b> Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships' big guns.

5|$|The British gave Benedict Arnold a brigadier general's commission, with {{an annual}} income of several hundred pounds, but paid him only £6,315 plus an annual pension of £360 because his plot had failed.

This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced.|$|E
