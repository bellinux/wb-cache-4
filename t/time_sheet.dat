25|$|In Malaysia, Räikkönen {{topped the}} <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> {{in the second}} {{practice}} session. Räikkönen was ninth in qualifying. Sebastian Vettel and Rubens Barrichello's ten and five-place penalties respectively meant that {{he was promoted to}} 7th. During the race, rain was predicted and the team took a gamble to change Räikkönen to full wet tyres while the track was still dry. The gamble did not pay off, and Räikkönen fell down the field. By the time the race was stopped on the 33rd lap due to torrential rain, Räikkönen was classified 14th.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the back}} of the Thursday <b>time</b> <b>sheet,</b> Schiattarella and Verstappen shared the former's chassis to set the 20th and 19th-fastest times respectively, as Verstappen's gearbox was still refusing to run smoothly. Schiattarella spun at La Rascasse and {{attempted}} to execute a spin-turn at the blind entry to the corner, almost collecting Roberto Moreno's Forti in the process; he was given a $20,000 fine, suspended for three races, for [...] "creating a very dangerous situation". Verstappen then took over the car and crashed it, restricting the Simtek team to a total of ninelaps between its two drivers. Behind Boullion, Andrea Montermini (Pacific) set the 22nd-quickest time, ahead of Moreno, who had to share his car with Diniz after the latter's gearbox failed, restricting him to 25thplace, over fourseconds slower than his teammate. Occupying the lastspot on the provisional grid, Bertrand Gachot failed to set a time due to a sheared brake disc on his Pacific, which caused his left-rear wheel to fall off on his first out-lap, forcing him to abandon his car out on the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|On June21, Bradley {{discovered}} that a flaw in his software misread the forensic data and that the word [...] "chloroform" [...] had been searched for only one time and the website in question offered information {{on the use of}} chloroform in the 19th century. On June 23, Baez called Cindy Anthony to the stand, who told jurors she had been the one who performed the [...] "chloroform" [...] search on the family computer in March 2008. The prosecution alleged that only Casey Anthony could have conducted this search and the others because {{she was the only one}} home at the time. When asked by prosecutors how she could have made the Internet searches when employment records show she was at work, Cindy Anthony said despite what her work <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> indicates, she was at home during these time periods because she left from work early during the days in question. Bradley alerted prosecutor Linda Burdick and Sgt. Kevin Stenger of the Sheriff's Office the weekend of June 25 about the discrepancy in his software, and volunteered to fly to Orlando at his own expense to show them. On the same day, the judge temporarily halted proceedings when the defense filed a motion to determine if Anthony was competent to proceed with trial. The motion states the defense received a privileged communication from their client which caused them to believe [...] "...Ms. Anthony is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense". The trial resumed on June27 when the judge announced that the results of the psychological evaluations showed Anthony was competent to proceed. Later, in testimony about air samples, Dr. Ken Furton, a professor of chemistry at Florida International University, stated that there is no consensus in the field on what chemicals are typical of human decomposition. Judge Perry ruled that the jury would not get to smell air samples taken from the trunk.|$|E

50|$|In his 1908 Cost Keeping and Management Engineering Halbert Gillette {{presented}} a cost keeping {{system and its}} application to sewer work, which incorporated an advanced type of time book, which he called <b>time</b> <b>sheet.</b> Although the form was named <b>time</b> <b>sheet,</b> {{it was actually a}} fully developed time book, and not a modern <b>time</b> <b>sheet.</b> This system was in use at the Moore-Mansfield Construction Company and the Mansfield Engineering Company from Indianapolis, Indiana, an engineering designing and general contracting office. Gillette explained the system as follows:The essential and fundamental feature of the system depends upon the form of the <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> used (front view of <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> (first image), and back view (second image)). The <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> is folded when in use by the timekeeper and carried in a cover, making the same of book size, and practically the same form as the ordinary time book. On the left hand side of the front appears the <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> in the usual form.This <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> is arranged so that it may be used for a gang reporting time weekly, and is also used where the <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> is turned in each day, in which latter case the lines under the column dates are ignored and the time placed in the total hour column. On the left hand side appears first the timekeeper's check column.The instructions to the timekeeper {{on the back of the}} sheet (second image) are probably sufficiently clear, although it might be added that where the <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> is used as a weekly report, as is generally the case, where the gang is small or where the work is unimportant, the time is checked and divided by means of the four squares under each date and opposite each name, each square thus representing one-fourth of a day.In the case of the <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> as illustrated, the distributions shown are for a sewer job and the particular distributions required are shown printed in by means of a rubber stamp. Each distribution thereby for this job shows a particular key letter although the same letter may not mean the same thing on any two jobs, but reference is made to the rubber stamp heading on each contract to determine the meaning of such letter...|$|E

The value of the uniform <b>time</b> <b>sheet</b> lies in the education of the timekeepers, resulting in a more efficient working force. Under the old system with individual time sheets, prepared especially for each job, the forms of the time sheets were many and various, and, for this very reason timekeepers presumed to incorporate their own ideas and make changes and innovations, resulting in a bunch of data that required hours, and generally the personal attendance of the timekeepers, to work out." ...|$|E
