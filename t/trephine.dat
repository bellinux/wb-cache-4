2500|$|Bone marrow {{aspiration}} and <b>trephine</b> biopsy {{are usually}} {{performed on the}} back of the hipbone, or posterior iliac crest. [...] An aspirate can also be obtained from the sternum (breastbone). [...] For the sternal aspirate, the patient lies on their back, with a pillow under the shoulder to raise the chest. A <b>trephine</b> biopsy should never be performed on the sternum, due to the risk of injury to blood vessels, lungs or the heart. [...] Bone marrow aspiration may also be performed on the tibial (shinbone) site in children up to 2 years of age while spinous process aspiration is frequently done in a lumbar puncture position and on the L3-L4 vertebrae.|$|E
2500|$|Bone marrow samples can be {{obtained}} by aspiration and <b>trephine</b> biopsy. [...] Sometimes, a bone marrow examination will include both an aspirate and a biopsy. [...] The aspirate yields semi-liquid bone marrow, which can be examined by a pathologist under a light microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry, chromosome analysis, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequently, a <b>trephine</b> biopsy is also obtained, which yields a narrow, cylindrically shaped solid piece of bone marrow, 2mm wide and 2cm long (80 μL), which is examined microscopically (sometimes with the aid of immunohistochemistry) for cellularity and infiltrative processes. An aspiration, using a 20 mL syringe, yields approximately 300 μL of bone marrow. A volume greater than 300 μL is not recommended, since it may dilute the sample with peripheral blood.|$|E
2500|$|The prefrontal leucotomy, a {{precursor}} to lobotomy, was performed by cutting a <b>trephine</b> hole into the skull, inserting an instrument, and destroying parts of the brain.

2500|$|Bone marrow {{examination}} {{refers to}} the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called a <b>trephine</b> biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. [...] Bone marrow examination {{is used in the}} diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. [...] The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.|$|E
2500|$|Trepanning, {{also known}} as trepanation, trephination, trephining or making a burr hole (the verb trepan derives from Old French via Medieval Latin, from the Greek noun of trypanon, {{literally}} [...] "borer, auger") is a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the human skull, exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases or release pressured blood buildup from an injury. It may also refer to any [...] "burr" [...] hole created through other body surfaces, including nail beds. [...] It {{is often used to}} relieve pressure beneath a surface. [...] A <b>trephine</b> is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, the {{aspirate}} {{is performed}} first. An aspirate needle is inserted {{through the skin}} using manual pressure and force until it abuts the bone. Then, with a twisting motion of clinician's hand and wrist, the needle is advanced through the bony cortex (the hard outer layer of the bone) and into the marrow cavity. Once the needle is in the marrow cavity, a syringe is attached and used to aspirate ("suck out") liquid bone marrow. A twisting motion is performed during the aspiration to avoid excess content {{of blood in the}} sample, which might be the case if an excessively large sample from one single point is taken. Subsequently, the biopsy is performed if indicated. [...] A different, larger <b>trephine</b> needle is inserted and anchored in the bony cortex. The needle is then advanced with a twisting motion and rotated to obtain a solid piece of bone marrow. This piece is then removed along with the needle. The entire procedure, once preparation is complete, typically takes 10–15 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|In ancient times, holes were drilled into {{a person}} who was {{behaving}} in what was considered an abnormal way to let out what they believed were evil spirits. Evidence of trepanation has been found in prehistoric human remains from Neolithic times onward. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and mental disorders. The bone that was trepanned was kept by the prehistoric people and may have been worn as a charm to keep evil spirits away. [...] Evidence also suggests that trepanation was primitive emergency surgery after head wounds to remove shattered bits of bone from a fractured skull and clean out the blood that often pools under the skull after a blow to the head. [...] Such injuries were typical for primitive weaponry such as slings and war clubs. There is some contemporary use of the term. [...] In modern eye surgery, a <b>trephine</b> instrument is used in corneal transplant surgery. The procedure of drilling a hole through a fingernail or toenail is also known as trephination. It is performed by a physician or surgeon to relieve the pain associated with a subungual hematoma (blood under the nail); a small amount of blood is expressed through the hole and the pain associated with the pressure is partially alleviated.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November 1935 at the Hospital Santa Marta in Lisbon, Moniz {{initiated}} {{the first of}} a series of operations on the brains of the mentally ill. The initial patients selected for the operation were provided by the medical director of Lisbon's Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital, José de Matos Sobral Cid. As Moniz lacked training in neurosurgery and his hands were crippled from gout, the procedure was performed under general anaesthetic by Pedro Almeida Lima, who had previously assisted Moniz with his research on cerebral angiography. The intention was to remove some of the long fibres that connected the frontal lobes to other major brain centres. To this end, it was decided that Lima would <b>trephine</b> into the side of the skull and then inject ethanol into the [...] "subcortical white matter of the prefrontal area" [...] so as to destroy the connecting fibres, or association tracts, and create what Moniz termed a [...] "frontal barrier". After the first operation was complete, Moniz considered it a success and, observing that the patient's depression had been relieved, he declared her [...] "cured" [...] although she was never, in fact, discharged from the mental hospital. Moniz and Lima persisted with this method of injecting alcohol into the frontal lobes for the next seven patients but, after having to inject some patients on numerous occasions to elicit what they considered a favourable result, they modified the means by which they would section the frontal lobes. For the ninth patient they introduced a surgical instrument called a leucotome; this was a cannula that was [...] in length and [...] in diameter. It had a retractable wire loop at one end that, when rotated, produced a [...] diameter circular lesion in the white matter of the frontal lobe. Typically, six lesions were cut into each lobe, but, if they were dissatisfied by the results, Lima might perform several procedures, each producing multiple lesions in the left and right frontal lobes.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} treating subungual haematomas by simple <b>trephining,</b> in terms of nail appearance and function, and to identify factors associated with a poor outcome. METHODS: Patients with subungual haematomas attending an {{accident and emergency department}} over a 12 month period were identified; 5 - 13 months after injury a telephone and postal survey of patient's assessment of their own outcome was made using a proforma. Outcome was graded according to published criteria. RESULTS: 123 patients with 127 subungual haematomas were identified and 74 % were followed up; 85 % achieved an "excellent" or "very good" result, with 67 % reporting no residual abnormalities. A "poor" outcome occurred in only 2 % owing to nail splitting. No correlation was found between adverse outcome and haematoma size, presence of fracture, or infection. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of subungual haematomas by simple <b>trephining</b> gives an acceptable result in the majority of patients and those with a poor outcome cannot be predicted at presentation. The findings suggest that only simple <b>trephining</b> for symptomatic relief is required for subungual haematomas and that aggressive surgical treatment is unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{continues}} to be considerable interest {{in the use of}} decompressive craniectomy in the management of neurological emergencies. The procedure is technically straightforward; however, it is becoming increasingly apparent that it is associated with significant complications. One complication that has received relatively little attention is the neurological dysfunction that can occur due to the absence of the bone flap and the subsequent distortion of the brain under the scalp as cerebral swelling subsides. The aim of this narrative review was to examine the literature available regarding the clinical features described, outline the proposed pathophysiology for these clinical manifestations and highlight the implications that this may have for rehabilitation of patients with a large skull defect. Methods: A literature search was performed in the MEDLINE database (1966 to June 2012). The following keywords were used: Hemicraniectomy, decompressive craniectomy, complications, syndrome of the <b>trephined,</b> syndrome of the sinking scalp flap, motor <b>trephined</b> syndrome. The bibliographies of retrieved reports were searched for additional references. Results: Various terms have been used to describe the different neurological signs and symptoms with which patients with a skull defect can present. These include; syndrome of the <b>trephined,</b> posttraumatic syndrome, syndrome of the sinking scalp flap, and motor <b>trephined</b> syndrome. There is, however, considerable overlap between the conditions described and a patient′s individual clinical presentation. Conclusion: It is becoming increasingly apparent that certain patients are particularly susceptible to the presence of a large skull defect. The term "Neurological Susceptibility to a Skull Defect" (NSSD) is therefore suggested as a blanket term to describe any neurological change attributable to the absence of cranial coverage...|$|R
