A {{significant increase in the}} quality factor of the resonator, from 376 to 13876, is observed. It is confirmed that the change in resistance of the silicon <b>tuning</b> <b>probe</b> with temperature is the main factor responsible for the improvement.

To optimise such processes a thorough understanding of the physical processes within the plasma is essential. In this thesis low pressure radio frequency argon plasmas are investigated in order to understand further the physics of their behaviour under certain conditions. <b>Tuned</b> Langmuir <b>probes</b> and microwave mterferometry are used as diagnostics methods to measure different plasma parameters as a function of gas pressure, current density and applied voltage. The spatial variations of these parameters are examined within the bulk plasma. In particular the electron distribution function was obtained from the Langmuir probe to observe transitions between heating modes which occur under certain conditions of the plasma. To further understand this transition a small variable transverse magnetic field was applied to the plasma to confine the electrons and modify their trajectories Mathematical models devised and compared to the experimental results showed an excellent agreement.

The superconducting resonator is only 1. 24 mm × 0. 66 mm and demonstrates a Q of up to 1078 at 6. 3 GHz and at 77 K. A tuning range of 12 % is demonstrated with a maximum applied voltage of 40 V.

40|$|In silico–designed {{nucleic acid}} probes and primers {{often do not}} achieve {{favorable}} specificity and sensitivity tradeoffs on the first try, and iterative empirical sequence-based optimization is needed, particularly in multiplexed assays. We present a novel, on-the-fly method of <b>tuning</b> <b>probe</b> affinity and selectivity by adjusting the stoichiometry of auxiliary species, which allows for independent and decoupled adjustment of the hybridization yield for different probes in multiplexed assays. Using this method, we achieved near-continuous tuning of probe effective free energy. To demonstrate our approach, we enforced uniform capture efficiency of 31 DNA molecules (GC content, 0 – 100 %), maximized the signal difference for 11 pairs of single-nucleotide variants and performed tunable hybrid capture of mRNA from total RNA. Using the Nanostring nCounter platform, we applied stoichiometric tuning to simultaneously adjust yields for a 24 -plex assay, and we show multiplexed quantitation of RNA sequences and variants from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples...|$|E

40|$|The optical {{absorption}} and the optical rectification coefficients associated to hydrogenic impurity interstate transitions in zincblende GaN-based nanostructures of the quantum wire type are investigated. The system {{is assumed to}} have cylindrical shape {{and the influence of}} external <b>tuning</b> <b>probes</b> such as hydrostatic pressure and static electric fields is particularly taken into account. The electron states are obtained within the effective mass approximation, via the exact diagonalization of the donor-impurity Hamiltonian with parabolic confinement. The nonlinear optical coefficients are calculated using a nonperturbative solution of the density-matrix Bloch equation. Our results show that the resonance-related features of the optical response become shifted in the frequency range of the incident radiation due to the effect of the hydrostatic pressure, the strength of the applied field and the change in the impurity center position.

40|$|Low pressure, {{radio-frequency}} (rf) glow discharges {{have been}} used extensively in plasma processing in recent years. To exploit {{the advantages of the}} rf plasma fully, a detailed knowledge of the discharge physics is required. Many powerful models have evolved which attempt to describe the plasma and predict plasma parameters under varying conditions. However, in the absence of versatile and reliable diagnostic experimental tools, such models cannot be tested and the processing operator must rely on the so-called "Response Surface Methodology" to predict plasma-chemistry and physical reaction rates. This thesis reports on the development of a <b>tuned</b> Langmuir <b>probe,</b> which has been used to monitor plasma parameters, including the electron energy distribution function (eedf), in 13. 56 MHz argon and nitrogen plasmas under various discharge conditions. The development and application of the <b>tuned</b> <b>probe</b> is described, as is the rf environment, since successful measurements rely on a thorough understanding of the subtleties of the two. The plasma parameter measurements are presented as a function of gas pressure, spatial distribution and input rf power. The results are generally interpreted in terms of accepted rf plasma theory, which is still evolving. The eedf measurements demonstrate that the argon and nitrogen plasmas are created via different ionization processes, and may be strongly influenced by inelastic and super-elastic collision processes. Plasma heating, a topic of much recent debate, is discussed, and an electron trapping mechanism, which resolves some of the questions posed by the eedf measurements and the current plasma heating theories, is presented...|$|R

A&STRACT (Mawnum JOG woW We have {{investigated}} the problem of Gz-induced blackout in an animal model in which controlled brief global cerebral ischemia is produced repeatedly at short intervals.

40|$|Due to the {{harmonic}} {{motion of the}} cantilever in Tapping Mode Atomic Force Microscopy, it is seemingly impossible to estimate the tip-sample interactions from {{the motion of the}} cantilever. Not directly observing the interaction force, it is possible to damage the surface or the tip by applying an excessive mechanical load. The tip-sample interactions scale with the effective stiffness of the probe. Thus, the reduction of the mechanical load is usually limited by the manufacturability of low stiffness probes. However, the one-to-one relationship between spring constant and applied force only holds when higher modes of the cantilever are not excited. In this paper, it is shown that, by passively tuning higher modes of the cantilever, it is possible to reduce the peak repulsive force. These <b>tuned</b> <b>probes</b> can be dynamically more compliant than conventional probes with the same static spring constant. Both theoretical and experimental results show that a proper tuning of dynamic modes of cantilevers reduces the contact load and increases the sensitivity considerably. Moreover, due to the contribution of higher modes, the tuned cantilevers provide more information on the tip-sample interaction. This extra information from the higher harmonics can be used for mapping and possibly identification of material properties of samples. Structural Optimization and Mechanic...|$|R
