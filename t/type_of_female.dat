5|$|As {{the two are}} {{otherwise}} unattested outside of Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions have been made that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> deity).|$|E
25|$|Rudin was {{the first}} of Turgenev’s novels, but already in this work the topic of the {{superfluous}} man and his inability to act (which became a major theme of Turgenev's literary work) was explored. Similarly to other Turgenev’s novels, the main conflict in Rudin was centred on a love story of the main character and a young, but intellectual and self-conscious woman who is contrasted with the main hero (this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> character became known in literary criticism as «тургеневская девушка», “Turgenev maid”).|$|E
25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E

500|$|The bikini {{gradually}} grew to gain wide {{acceptance in}} Western society. According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard, the bikini {{is perhaps the}} most popular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> beachwear around the globe because of [...] "the power of women, and not the power of fashion". As he explains, [...] "The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women." [...] By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> {{character}} previously unseen in Final Fantasy games, {{one with}} an athlete's body and a less feminine nature.

Commenting on the resemblance, Toriyama stated that {{the similarities between the}} characters only extend to their cold personalities and their military backgrounds, and that otherwise [...] "Lightning really [...] her own person." [...] Nomura compared the two shortly before the Japanese release of Lightning Returns, saying that he had [...] "desired for her to be carefully developed and loved for a long time, like Cloud." [...] Toriyama has said that, among the characters he had been involved in creating, Lightning was his favorite female character from a video game, alongside Yuna from Final Fantasy X and Yoyo from Bahamut Lagoon.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama wanted Lightning to {{be a new}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> {{character}} with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series. His guideline to Nomura was to make her [...] "strong and beautiful", and she was intended to be reminiscent of Final Fantasy VIIs Cloud Strife. Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development. The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role {{in the creation of the}} non-playable characters.|$|E

500|$|A few musicologists {{have speculated}} that The Wood Nymph is {{potentially}} autobiographical. Murtomäki, most notably, {{has argued that the}} tone poem's depiction of [...] "a fatal sexual conjunction" [...] between Björn and the [...] is a possible allusion to the composer's own youthful indiscretions. [...] "The strong autobiographical element in Skogsrået is unmistakable", Murtomäki has written, adding that in the ballade, [...] "Sibelius probably confesses an affair to Aino". For Murtomäki, the balladic nature of The Wood Nymph is key, as in the genre [...] "it was expected that the singer/storyteller/composer should reveal himself". At the time, it was common for the first sexual partners of men of Sibelius's class to be prostitutes. Murtomäki says that [...] "In their concealed or [...] "unofficial" [...] sexual life, they experienced a certain <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> sexual adventurousness that their wives could not easily match." [...] He hypothesizes that The Wood Nymph and other contemporaneous compositions were Sibelius's method of dealing with the emotional consequences of this and his guilt towards his wife Aino.|$|E

2500|$|Discussions {{of female}} orgasm are {{complicated}} by orgasms in women typically being {{divided into two}} categories: clitoral orgasm and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasm. In 1973, Irving Singer theorized {{that there are three}} types of female orgasms; he categorized these as vulval, uterine, and blended, but because he was a philosopher, [...] "these categories were generated from descriptions of orgasm in literature rather than laboratory studies". In 1982, Ladas, Whipple and Perry also proposed three categories: the tenting type (derived from clitoral stimulation), the A-frame type (derived from G-spot stimulation), and the blended type (derived from clitoral and G-spot stimulation). In 1999, Whipple and Komisaruk proposed cervix stimulation as being able to cause a fourth <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> orgasm.|$|E

6000|$|... --The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, said Stephen, all admire a {{different}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>female</b> beauty. That {{seems to be}} a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see, however, two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lecture-room where MacCann, with one hand on THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES and the other hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new model of {{permanent}} monogamous pair formation in zoological populations with multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>females</b> and males. According to this model, animals randomly encounter members of the opposite sex at their so-called firing times to form temporary pairs which then become permanent if mating happens. Given the distributions of the firing times and the mating preferences upon encounter, we analyze the contingency table <b>of</b> permanent pair <b>types</b> in three cases: (i) definite mating upon encounter; (ii) Poisson firing times; and (iii) Bernoulli firing times. In the first case, the contingency table has a multiple hypergeometric distribution which implies panmixia. The other two cases generalize the encounter-mating models of Gimelfarb (1988) who gives conditions that he conjectures to be sufficient for panmixia. We formulate adaptations of his conditions and prove that they not only characterize panmixia but also allow us to reduce the model to the first case by changing its underlying parameters. Finally, when there are only two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>females</b> and males, we provide a full characterization of panmixia, homogamy and heterogamy. Comment: 27 pages.
