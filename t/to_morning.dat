25|$|According to an Ancient Greek and Roman custom, the day was, {{like the}} night, {{divided into four}} parts, each {{consisting}} of three hours.

25|$|Frock coats {{worn with}} {{waistcoat}} and formal striped trousers {{are still very}} occasionally worn as daytime formal wear, especially to weddings, as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>morning</b> coats, {{in order to give}} the wedding attire a Victorian flavour.

25|$|A.gravesii was {{produced}} by artificial hybridization in 1954–1955 by Thomas Darling, Jr., who provided {{a detailed account of}} the process. Spores of the two parental species were sown on damp peat moss and kept largely in the shade, except for a few hours of morning sun. Gametophytes developed, and the young sporophytes that grew from them were large enough to remove in autumn. They were transplanted into a well-drained, gravelly loam. They were raised in a humid terrarium exposed <b>to</b> <b>morning</b> sunlight, with a layer of tissue to shade them from direct sunlight. Of the A.gravesii in the mixed population, one reached maturity in August 1955; two others did not mature until June 1956. Difficulties were encountered due to aphid infestation and various diseases promoted by excess moisture.|$|E
25|$|Once double breasted frock coats were established, lapels were sharply creased {{and their}} form was more static, varying only in {{details such as}} height, since they were buttoned nearly to the neck by the Edwardians, then {{lengthened}} to the classic three-button shape, the two-button jacket being a further American innovation. The other significant change over that period {{was the use of}} the revers {{in the construction of the}} lapel, as the Victorians used elaborate three-part patterns to cut a fold of cloth from the lining into the front of the lapel, a universal consideration of frock coats and dress coats of the period, but abandoned in favor of the current single-piece lapels at the same time as the switch <b>to</b> <b>morning</b> coats and lounge suits. Modern lapels are largely identical in form to their 1930s counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Public executions {{were the}} norm and {{continued}} until 1939. From the mid-19th century, the usual {{time of day}} for executions changed from around 3 pm <b>to</b> <b>morning</b> and then to dawn. Executions had been carried out in large central public spaces such as market squares but gradually moved towards the local prison. In the early 20th century, the guillotine was set up just outside the prison gates. The last person to be publicly guillotined was six-time murderer Eugen Weidmann who was executed on 17 June 1939 outside the St-Pierre prison in Versailles. Photographs of the execution appeared in the press, and apparently this spectacle led the government to stop public executions and to hold them instead in prison courtyards, such as La Santé Prison in Paris. Following the law, {{the first to be}} guillotined inside a prison was Jean Dehaene, who had murdered his estranged wife and father-in-law, executed on 19 July 1939 at St-Brieuc.|$|E

500|$|Outlaw Star has {{received}} very modest commercial success and miscellaneous viewer recognition. The initial shipment of the manga's first volume sold out nationwide in Japan. According <b>to</b> <b>Morning</b> Star Studio's English website, the Outlaw Star manga has sold 250,000 copies, though the anime series was less successful. The Outlaw Star television series was aired in Japan during {{a late night}} timeslot {{because it was not}} likely to obtain {{more than one or two}} percent viewership like prime time shows. Outlaw Star was voted as the 20th best anime of 1999 in the Japanese Animage Anime Grand Prix. During a summer 2001 online poll to determine which show would return to Toonami, Outlaw Star received approximately two-thirds of the more than 150,000 votes cast. In August 2002, Cartoon Network announced that the late-night Adult Swim Outlaw Star received a Nielsen rating of 0.9, up 125percent for that same time slot and a delivery of 414,000, up 135percent for the 18–34 age range. The Outlaw Star Complete Collection was the 21st best-selling anime DVD in the United States in 2006 and the 25th in 2007. In 2012, Bandai's North American division, Bandai Entertainment, listed Outlaw Star as one of its top five most successful anime properties. Josh Pool of IGN listed Outlaw Star at number six on its [...] "Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time", noting a stark polarity between the opening and ending themes.|$|E
500|$|On 1 July 1920, {{in view of}} {{the rapidly}} {{advancing}} Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the Sejm, formed a Council for Defense of the Nation. It was chaired by Piłsudski and was to provide expeditious decision-making and temporarily supplant the fractious Sejm. The National Democrats, however, contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Piłsudski's fault and demanded that he resign; some even accused him of treason. Their 19 July failure to carry a vote of no-confidence in the council led to Roman Dmowski's withdrawal from it. On 12 August Piłsudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation. The Entente pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight. As Norman Davies noted, at that time, especially abroad, [...] "Piłsudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente. In France and England he was considered a treasonous ally who leads Poland into destruction; in Russia he was seen as a false servant of the allies, who will lead imperialism to ruin. All– from Lenin to Lloyd George, from Pravda <b>to</b> <b>Morning</b> Star– considered him a military and political failure. In August 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with the fall of Warsaw." ...|$|E

[...] And the Gemara likened the burning of incense to the kindling of the Menorah, holding that just as no service could follow lighting the Menorah, so no service could follow burning the incense. And because the Gemara likened the burning of incense to the kindling of the Menorah, it also concluded that just as {{at the time of}} the Menorah lighting there was a burning of incense, similarly, {{at the time of the}} cleaning of the Menorah there was also a burning of incense.|$|E
