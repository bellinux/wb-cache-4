60|$|It {{was there}} {{on one of the}} <b>terraces</b> <b>crowning</b> the splendid heights above immortal Rome that Messer Gianluca found me. He greeted me courteously; I {{answered}} with a snarl, deeming him come to pursue the plaguing from which I had fled.|$|R
60|$|The settlement, {{backed by}} its grand 'bush' and {{faced by the}} sea, {{consists}} of a castle and a subject town; it wears, in fact, a baronial and old-world look. Fort Santo Antonio, a tall white house upon a bastioned <b>terrace,</b> <b>crowns</b> proudly enough a knob of black rock and low green growth. On both sides of it, north and south, stretches the town; from this distance it appears a straggle of brown thatched huts and hovels, enlivened here and there by some whitewashed establishments, mining or 'in the mercanteel.' The soil is ruddy and rusty, {{and we have the}} usual African tricolor.|$|R
5000|$|The Evening Star Building, Washington, DC - Purchased in 1961 by the Woodner {{family for}} $650,000, the Evening Star Building {{had fallen on}} {{somewhat}} hard times. In 1962, the building was converted into utilitarian offices and the space leased in its entirety to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) {{for use by the}} U.S. Department of Justice. The federal agency leased the space for more than 20 years. In May 1987, the Jonathan Woodner Company, commissioned a restoration, renovation, and expansion of the historic structure. The renovation/expansion of the Evening Star Building eventually yielded 208000 sq ft for offices and 10000 sq ft for retail. In addition, a private rooftop <b>terrace</b> <b>crowns</b> the downtown building.|$|R

He was convenor of the FoE urban campaign which opposed the Sydney City Council's inappropriate high rise development.|$|R
50|$|Travelling from Arrowtown towards Cromwell the Crown Range Road {{starts at}} the bottom of the Zig Zag. This steep and winding climb goes to the <b>Crown</b> <b>Terrace</b> which is a large flat and fertile area capable of growing grain crops. The road off to the left is to Glencoe Station (Glencoe Road) and at the end of the <b>Crown</b> <b>Terrace</b> is the Eastburn Road to Eastburn Station. Glencoe Station is the large high country station behind Arrowtown. Eastburn Station is also large and runs from the Glencoe {{boundary}} almost to Cardrona, New Zealand.|$|R

50|$|Amongst {{those who}} financially {{contributed to the}} {{building}} of the new church were Lady Anne Antrobus, wife of Sir Edmund Antrobus, her sister-in-law through marriage, The Hon Jane Duff-Gordon, and a young dowager, Amelia, Lady Boston. A sizeable benefaction made by the ladies was used to purchase the grounds of Pountney House which ran from what is now Acanthus Road to the end of <b>Crown</b> <b>Terrace</b> (where the <b>Crown</b> pub is situated today), and north of the church to Elsley Road. Only about a third of this land now remains in church hands. It was not until 1872, that Father Wilkinson, Lady Antrobus and the Hon. Mrs. Jane Duff-Gordon moved to Lavender Hill and the plot of land on which the church stands was purchased, thanks to the generosity of Lady Boston.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{tradition}} of building pagodas in Myanmar, the Bupaya Pagoda also conformed to the norms set for such structures. The pagoda had a massive gravity-type pyramidal profile. It was built with bricks and impressively decorated. It was a bell-shaped dome built over diminishing <b>terraces.</b> A finial <b>crowned</b> the dome. The pagoda enshrined Buddha's relics.|$|R
60|$|The thought, {{like some}} {{stealing}} perfume, carried {{him back to}} those wonderful nights at Richmond when after dinner he sat smoking on the <b>terrace</b> of the <b>Crown</b> and Sceptre with Nicholas Treffry and Traquair and Jack Herring and Anthony Thornworthy. How good his cigars were then! Poor old Nick!--dead, and Jack Herring--dead, and Traquair--dead of that wife of his, and Thornworthy--awfully shaky (no wonder, with his appetite).|$|R
50|$|Atop {{the central}} belfry tower of six stories with three <b>terraces,</b> a stone <b>crown</b> {{supports}} a gilded brass figure of Hanske de Krijger (Hans the Warrior), mythical {{guardian of the}} city. The crown on the tower and the double-headed eagles over the attic windows pay homage to a famous visitor to Oudenaarde, Emperor Charles V, who fathered Margaret of Parma here {{a few years before}} construction of the Town Hall began.|$|R
50|$|Bürkliterrasse, {{also named}} after Arnold Bürkli, is {{situated}} on the lake front. It {{was designed as a}} culmination of the Bahnhofstrasse and the lakeshore promenades. At its inauguration in 1887, the <b>terrace</b> was <b>crowned</b> by two huge plaster lions by Urs Eggenschwyler; however, they found little favor with the citizens and were removed two years later. Since 1952, the sculpture by Hermann Hubacher adorns the trees, showing the Abduction from Olympus, Zeus {{in the form of an}} eagle and his beautiful lover Ganymede. The original elm trees became diseased and were replaced by ball maples. The Bürkliterrasse is listed in the inventory of notable gardens and grounds of local importance which was established in 1989 as Inventar der schützenswerten Gärten und Anlagen von kommunaler Bedeutung (Inventory of the gardens and parks of communal significance and worthy of protection).|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century boxing matches took place at the Old Tiger's Head. Horse racing and (human) foot racing took place in the 1840s but the police put a stop to these events, {{probably}} under pressure from local citizens. At that time the green was the centre of village life with cricket matches, bare knuckle boxing and other entertainments. In the 1850s further house-building prompted the installation of proper sewers and the Lee Green horse pond was filled in. In the 1860s John Pound, a developer, erected houses in the south-east quadrant, Orchard Terrace on Eltham Road and <b>Crown</b> <b>Terrace</b> on Burnt Ash Lane (now Road).|$|R
60|$|From the {{conservatory}} they {{stepped into the}} garden. It was a delicious afternoon; the sun had sunk behind the grove, and the air, which had been throughout the day somewhat oppressive, was now warm, but mild. At Ducie there was a fine old terrace facing the western hills, that bound the valley in which the Bower was situate. These hills, a ridge of moderate elevation, but of picturesque form, parted just opposite the terrace, as if on purpose to admit the setting sun, like inferior existences that had, as it were, made way before the splendour of some mighty lord or conqueror. The lofty and sloping bank which this <b>terrace</b> <b>crowned</b> was covered with rare shrubs, and occasionally a group of tall trees sprang up among them, and broke the view with an interference which was far from ungraceful, while plants, spreading forth from large marble vases, had extended over their trunks, and sometimes, in their play, had touched even their topmost branches. Between the terrace and the distant hills extended a tract of pasture-land, green and well-wooded by its rich hedgerows; not a roof was visible, though many farms and hamlets were at hand; and, {{in the heart of}} a rich and populous land, here was a region where the shepherd or the herdsman was the only evidence of human existence. It was thither, a grateful spot at such an hour, that Miss Temple and her companion directed their steps. The last beam of the sun flashed across the flaming horizon as they gained the terrace; the hills, well wooded, or presenting a bare and acute outline to the sky, rose sharply defined in form; while in another direction some more distant elevations were pervaded with a rich purple tint, touched sometimes with a rosy blaze of soft and flickering light. The whole scene, indeed, from the humble pasture-land that was soon to creep into darkness, to the proud hills whose sparkling crests were yet touched by the living beam, was bathed with lucid beauty and luminous softness, and blended with the glowing canopy of the lustrous sky. But on the terrace and the groves that rose beyond it, and on the glades and vistas into which they opened, fell the full glory of the sunset. Each moment a new shadow, now rosy, now golden, now blending in its shifting tints all the glory of the iris, fell over the rich pleasure-grounds, their groups of rare and noble trees, and their dim or glittering avenues.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} brownstones {{throughout}} numerous New York City neighborhoods, {{especially in the}} Brooklyn neighborhoods of Park Slope, Clinton Hill, Fort Greene, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill, Gowanus, Windsor <b>Terrace,</b> Prospect Heights, <b>Crown</b> Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Bedford Stuyvesant, Sunset Park, Bay Ridge and parts of Williamsburg, Bushwick, Greenpoint, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens. The Manhattan neighborhood of the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Harlem, East Harlem and parts of Washington Heights too, retains many brownstones. In Queens, the historic district of Long Island City and in The Bronx the historic districts of Mott Haven, also host many brownstones. Brownstones also predominate in some Hudson County neighborhoods directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan, especially in Hoboken and around Van Vorst Park and Hamilton Park in Jersey City. [...] New York City brownstones usually cost several million dollars to purchase. A typical architectural detail of brownstones in and around New York City is the stoop, a steep staircase rising from {{the street to the}} entrance on what amounts to almost the second-floor level. This design was seen as hygienic at the time many were built, because the streets were so foul with animal waste.|$|R
5000|$|Temple II is most liveable {{still with}} {{retaining}} walls and terraces stiffs, first stage the oval terrace {{was built in}} local stone, but after an enlargement {{it was built in}} limestone which must have been carried by boat from nearby Jidda island where stone was hewn out by hand and carefully dressed into remarkably neat masonry blocks. The skill with which this task was carried out may be clearly seen in the temple walls and especially around the sacred well. A double circular altar and an offering table stood {{in the center of the}} shrine. To the south were three cult stones shaped like the anchors of the merchant ships. Although the central one bore a protruding animal head, like the altars depicted on the seals. A temple treasure lay in the stone frame pit in the north-east comer.The central <b>terrace</b> was <b>crowned</b> by a shrine built of cut stone with stone paving. Smaller buildings clustered around it covering the rest of the terrace. There were no buildings on the outer oval terrace but altars and cult symbols were visible. A plinth with recessed stone cylinder lay to the south and a plinth with three pillars was situated near the north-west wall. A double row of plinths for cult objects lined both sides of the stairs from the upper terrace. On each of these plinths were two square holes lined with bitumen and sheet copper nailed to wood.Here may have stood copper mounted poles with the emblems of gods, so often seen on the stamp seals, or, perhaps, wooden statues. From the central terrace a ceremonial stairway led to the subterranean shrine where water cult ceremonies took place. Halfway down the stair was a portal, and from there the stair was roofed. The rich natural spring which filled the pool probably accounts for the siting of the temple at Barbar. Water poured from a perforated stone jar beside a semicircular stone font at the threshold of a dry chamber near the basin. From the comers of the shrine deep stone built channels led the water to the surrounding fields and gardens ...|$|R
5000|$|DuBois {{recorded}} in his report, [...] "On Monday, the 23d of July, {{the conference was}} invited to a five o'clock tea given by the Reform Cobden Club of London {{in honor of the}} delegates, at its headquarters in the St. Ermin Hotel, one of the most elegant in the city. Several members of Parliament and other notables were present. A splendid repast was served, and for two hours the delegates were delightfully entertained by the members and friends of the club.At 5 o'clock on Tuesday a tea was given in our honor by the late Dr. Creighton, Lord Bishop of London, at his stately palace at Fulham, which has been occupied by the Bishops of London since the fifteenth century. On our arrival at the palace we found his Lordship and one or two other Bishops, with their wives and daughters, waiting to greet us. After a magnificent repast had been served we were conducted through the extensive grounds which surround the palace....Through the kindness of Mr. Clark, a member of Parliament, we were invited to tea on Wednesday, at 5 o'clock, on the Terrace of Parliament. After the tea the male members of our party were admitted to the House of Commons, which is considered quite an honor; indeed, the visit to the House of Parliament and tea on the <b>Terrace</b> was the <b>crowning</b> honor of the series. Great credit is due our genial secretary, Mr. H. Sylvester Williams, for these social functions.Miss Catherine Impey, of London, said she was glad to come in contact with the class of Negroes that composed the Pan-African Conference, and wished that the best and most cultured would visit England and meet her citizens of noble birth, that the adverse opinion which had been created against them in some quarters of late by their enemies might be changed." ...|$|R
