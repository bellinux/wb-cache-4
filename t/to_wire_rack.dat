40|$|A {{simulation}} model {{was built to}} represent the dynamics of a General Electric (GE) dishwasher <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> production system associated with multiple types of racks and changeovers at the various work centers. A periodic-review inventory policy was simulated for the <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> production system using order-up-to safety stock SSi and a heuristic trigger variable P ∗ as the control variables. A discrete optimization model was formulated and executed {{in order to find}} near optimal values for the control variables with respect to minimization of the total inventory levels while satisfying constraints on demand for the various types of racks. Three different scenarios involving optimization of the {{simulation model}} were conducted to help GE improve their production strategy. ...|$|R

5000|$|Toaster oven: Toaster ovens {{are small}} {{electric}} ovens with a front door, <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> and removable baking pan. To toast bread with a toaster oven, {{slices of bread}} are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, {{but in most cases}} the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale.|$|R

5000|$|Condition: the <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> of grocery, drug, and toy {{stores were}} often {{only half the}} height of comic books, {{resulting}} in bent spines and dog-eared pages. In contrast, direct market retail outlets usually attempt to maintain their inventory in good condition. Their shelves are often the full height of the comic book. Many stores also included backing boards and mylar bags to further protect comics upon purchase (a practice {{that began in the}} 1980s and continues in some shops today).|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|R
50|$|Each {{passenger}} {{unit was}} equipped with adjustable seating, internal heating, non-draught windows, water tanks for drinking or washing, along with ample luggage storage in overhead <b>wire</b> <b>racks.</b> At least when new, the engines did not cause any vibration in the passenger compartments. The lighting system was powered by the then-standard Victorian Railways' 24vDC supply via belt-driven axle generators, with 20-watt globes. Trailer cars were not fitted with their own power supply, instead drawing power via jumper cables from adjacent units; the exceptions being 54 and 56MT, which {{are thought to have}} had batteries.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, William Howard Livens {{invented a}} small, non-electric {{dishwasher}} suitable for domestic use in 1924. It {{was the first}} dishwasher that incorporated most of the design elements that are featured in the models of today; it included a front door for loading, a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> hold the dirty crockery and a rotating sprayer. Drying elements were even added to his design in 1940. It was the first machine suitable for domestic use, and it {{came at a time}} when permanent plumbing and running water in the house was becoming increasingly common.|$|R

50|$|Fort Collins Weekly {{published}} {{its first}} issue on March 5, 2003. It {{was founded by}} publisher Joel Dyer and editor-in-chief Greg Campbell and operated for its first year from a small office on Oak Street in Old Town Fort Collins. The initial print run was 20,000 papers distributed free in newspaper boxes and <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> throughout the city. Circulation grew along with its staff and in September 2004, the Weekly relocated to offices in the historic Miller Block Building at 11 Old Town Square. In December 2007, 33,700 copies of the paper were printed, with 28,200 mailed directly to city residents and the remaining 5,500 distributed on the street.|$|R
50|$|Pockets, usually rimmed at {{the back}} with leather or plastic, may have leather mesh or cloth bags or plastic cups, or {{elongated}} <b>wire</b> <b>racks,</b> <b>to</b> catch the balls, common in home billiard rooms and pool halls, or in the coin-operated tables found in bars/pubs may instead lead to ball-return troughs inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection chamber {{on one side of}} the table (or, in non-coin-op models, on the racking end of the table). A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{optional}} accessories {{were available}} for the G-101: a travel bag, an expression pedal (volume pedal), {{and a set of}} bass pedals. The volume pedal had a spring-loaded side-lever {{that could be used to}} actuate the [...] "Glide" [...] and [...] "Trumpet Wow-wow" [...] effects. The 1/4" [...] TRS jack also enabled users to connect a Gibson [...] "Sabre" [...] amp, or one of two external reverb units made by both Gibson and Maestro (which manufactured the Echoplex), as well as to any standard guitar or keyboard amplifier. The [...] "Reverb" [...] tab would be used to activate one of these. The G-101 had no onboard reverb unit. The instrument's top had a removable, fold-down <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> for sheet music.|$|R

5000|$|Compact flowers like marigolds, chrysanthemums, cornflowers and zinnias {{dry well}} in a fan-assisted, {{convection}} chamber. Non-ventilated chambers are not appropriate, because they generate too much moisture. The material must be dried at a low temperature (30-35˚Celsius), over many hours. The flowers are slotted through holes in a <b>wire</b> mesh <b>rack</b> leaving room for the stems to dangle below. The time required depends upon {{the density of the}} flowers.|$|R
40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> Results: Drying on a hay rack produced very good hay. The upper portion of the hay dried on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried on a <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> The lower portion of the hay dried on the floor still contained too much water and was inappropriate for long term storage. Upper and lower portion of hay dried on the floor and hay dried on the rack were all taken wall by dairy cows, indicating no significant difference of the amount taken. (Received June 30, 1977...|$|R
