5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, such as {{the ability}} to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of pigments is intimately connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the source light.

Artificial light sources tend to have great peaks {{in some parts of}} their spectrum, and deep valleys in others. Viewed under these conditions, pigments will appear different colors.|$|E

25|$|Each photographed color component, {{initially}} just a colorless {{record of}} the luminous intensities {{in the part of}} the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image in the color complementary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the subtractive color method. In some early color processes (e.g., Kinemacolor), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through color filters to synthesize the original colors by the additive color method.|$|E
25|$|Service to Ft. Howard Veterans Hospital {{was added}} in 1973 after Route 4 absorbed Route 9, which had {{operated}} between 1971 and 1973. Ft.

During {{this time it was}} known in the community as 'the blue bus' owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the buses and to differentiate them from the yellow buses of the Baltimore Transit Company's No. 10 and 20 routes.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} in trials of pulsed dye laser, more than 25% of the redness was reduced by laser after one to three treatments. Adverse effects were rare in these trials, {{although}} some people had changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the skin, especially Chinese people with darker skin. There can be pain, crusting, and blistering in the two weeks after treatment. The trials only followed people for six months, so long-term outcomes are not known. Up to 10 treatments may be necessary for improvement, but complete removal may not result.|$|E

25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).|$|E
25|$|In the Torah the Israelites are {{commanded}} to dye one of {{the threads}} of their tallit (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; {{when they look at}} this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) Blue in Judaism has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.|$|E
25|$|PATH {{operates}} 24hours a day, {{seven days}} a week. During weekday hours, PATH operates four train services, using three terminals in New Jersey and two in Manhattan. Each line is represented by a unique color, which also corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> {{the lights on the}} front of the trains. The Journal Square – 33rd Street (via Hoboken) service is the only line represented by two colors (orange and blue), since it is a late-night hours combination of the Journal Square – 33rd Street and Hoboken – 33rd Street services. During peak hours, trains operate every four to eight minutes on each service. Every PATH station except Newark and Harrison is served by a train every two to three minutes, for a peak-hour service of 20 to 30 trains per hour.|$|E

50|$|Color mapping is a {{function}} that maps (transforms) <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> one (source) image <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> another (target) image.

25|$|Although Behn assures {{that she}} is not looking to {{entertain}} her reader with the adventures of a feigned hero, she does exactly this to enhance and romanticize the stories of Oroonoko. Ramesh Mallipeddi stresses that spectacle was the main mediator for the representation of alien cultures in Restoration England. Therefore, Behn describes Oroonoko’s native beauty as a spectacle of 'beauty so transcending' that surpassed 'all those of his gloomy race'. She completely romanticizes Oroonoko’s figure by portraying him as an ideal handsome hero; however due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> his skin, his body is still constricted within the limits of exoticism. Oroonoko has all the qualities of an English royal, but his ebony skin and country of origin prevent him from being a reputable European citizen. Due to these foreign qualities, his Englishness is incomplete. He has the English-like education and air, but lacks the skin color and legal status. Behn uses this conflicting description of Oroonoko to infuse some European familiarity into his figure while still remaining exotic enough. She compares Oroonoko to well-known historical figures like Hannibal and Alexander and describes Oroonoko’s running, wrestling and killing of tigers and snakes. Albert J. Rivero states that this comparison to great Western conquerors and kings translates and naturalizes Oroonoko’s foreignness into familiar European narratives. These historical allusions and romantic gallant feats allowed English readers to relate this exotic character with their own Western history and narrative tradition.|$|E
