5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put <b>the</b> <b>vest</b> on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
50|$|Vesting {{of options}} is straightforward.

5|$|When {{considering}} his appearance for Soulcalibur, different designs were considered, including {{one with a}} heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate {{at the end of}} Soul Edge, and another modeled after his appearance in Soul Edges opening sequence, featuring a wide-brimmed hat, though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear too thin. Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III, retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance. Elements of his previous design were retained, {{with the addition of a}} green vest and bracers, and the lengthening of the tail of his coat to his mid-thighs. His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game, featuring minimal changes save for opening <b>the</b> <b>vest</b> to have his chest be bare.|$|E

25|$|The first soft {{ballistic}} vest, Myunjebaegab, {{was invented}} in Joseon Korea in the 1860s shortly after the French campaign against Korea (1866). Heungseon Daewongun ordered development of bullet-proof armor because of increasing threats from Western armies. Kim Gi-du and Gang Yun found that cotton could protect against bullets if thick enough, and devised bullet-proof vests made of 30 layers of cotton. The vests were used in battle during the United States expedition to Korea (1871), when the US Navy attacked Ganghwa Island in 1871. The US Army captured one of the vests {{and took it to}} the US, where it was stored at the Smithsonian Museum until 2007. <b>The</b> <b>vest</b> has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group, a USAF expert panel, {{recommended}} several {{changes to}} deal with the oxygen supply issues. In October 2011, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $24M contract to investigate the breathing difficulties. In July 2012, the Pentagon concluded that a pressure valve on flight vests worn during high-altitude flights and a carbon air filter were likely sources of at least some hypoxia-like symptoms. Long-distance flights were resumed, but were limited to lower altitudes until corrections had been made. The carbon filters were changed to a different model to reduce lung exposure to carbon particulates. The breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve, used to inflate the pilot's vest during high G maneuvers, was found to be defective, inflating <b>the</b> <b>vest</b> at unintended intervals and restricting the pilot's breathing. The on-board oxygen generating system (OBOGS) also unexpectedly reduced oxygen levels during high-G maneuvers. [...] In late 2012, Lockheed Martin was awarded contracts to install a supplemental automatic oxygen backup system, in addition to the primary and manual backup. Changes recommended by the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group in 2005 received further consideration in 2012; the USAF reportedly considered installing EEG brain wave monitors on the pilot's helmets for inflight monitoring.|$|E
500|$|The show's fourth segment {{opened with}} [...] "These Four Walls", in which Cyrus {{wore a black}} high-low dress. The song was {{performed}} in B-stage with various acoustic musicians. The show proceeded with [...] "When I Look at You", a performance that featured the trailer for Cyrus' film The Last Song (2010) and her performing with a grand piano. It concluded with [...] "Obsessed", which the singer performed atop a simple suspension bridge. She re-entered the stage, clothed by a black tee, red cheetah-patterned hot pants, and black boots, to perform the second Hannah Montana-credited song [...] "Spotlight" [...] and, later, [...] "G.N.O. (Girl's Night Out)", replacing the prior hot pants with black ones and adding a denim vest. She followed with a cover of Arrows' [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll", where Cyrus mounted a red Harley-Davidson Dyna Fat Bob FXDF 2010 that was suspended above the stage and traveled in a semi-oval path across the venue. Performances of [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", which made use of a luggage cart, and [...] "Hovering", which featured Cyrus' older brother Trace Cyrus, rounded off the segment. The sixth segment of the show featured Cyrus performing [...] "Simple Song", in which she dressed in a long, white shirt and a black tuxedo, in order to simulate a music conductor. Midway through the performance, Cyrus stepped onto an elevator that rose eight feet from the stage. She exited the stage and returned for the final section. During the encore, Cyrus {{dressed in a white}} tank top and shorts, boots, and a metallic vest to perform [...] "See You Again", later removing <b>the</b> <b>vest</b> to conclude the concert with [...] "The Climb". Immediately after finishing, she exited through a passageway in the stage as fireworks were fired above.|$|E
500|$|After {{removing}} the wig, Cyrus then reappeared to perform eight more songs as herself. She {{emerged from the}} bottom of the runaway to perform [...] "Start All Over". She was costumed by studded black jeans with chains attached to the waist, a white tank top, a black leather vest and a matching glove. She roamed throughout the stage, kicking over the microphone stand and banging her head. [...] "Good and Broken" [...] and [...] "See You Again", where Cyrus removed <b>the</b> <b>vest</b> and was joined by multiple backup dancers, rounded off the show's fourth segment. She returned to the stage in a fuchsia bustier and short, black ruffled skirt to perform [...] "Let's Dance", where she performed Latin-influenced choreography with backup dancers, and [...] "Right Here". Prior to Cyrus re-entering the stage for the sixth segment, backup singers sang a reworked version of Toni Basil's [...] "Mickey" [...] (1982) that replaced the word [...] "Mickey" [...] with [...] "Miley". Cyrus, costumed in a pink tank top, a plaid miniskirt and sneakers with high-knee socks, performed [...] "East Northumberland High", amid backup dancers dressed as skateboarders and football players. Adding a black jacket, she concluded the main concert with [...] "G.N.O. (Girl's Night Out)" [...] and the theme to Hannah Montana, [...] "The Best of Both Worlds", a song credited to her alter ego. The latter had Cyrus interacting with video that depicted Hannah Montana and ended with the firing of confetti and fireworks. Sporadically throughout the Best Both Worlds Tour, Cyrus returned on stage for the performance of a one-song encore, which was either [...] "I Miss You" [...] or [...] "Ready, Set, Don't Go", a duet with her father Billy Ray Cyrus. Both songs were performed in an acoustic setting, without dancers or special effects. The prior had Cyrus performing acoustic guitar herself, while the latter had her father doing so.|$|E

2500|$|The Cumans were {{reported}} to be handsome people with blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes, and desirable women. Cuman women had a high reputation for their beauty amongst the Russian aristocracy.

[...] Underneath <b>the</b> <b>vest</b> was worn a short or long sleeved tunic/tabard, extended to the mid calf, splitting {{in the front and}} back between the legs. Men wore trousers and a caftan, each fastened by a belt, which was the traditional costume. The women also wore caftans, as well as pants, dresses, and tunics shorter than those worn by men, sometimes split along the front, back, and sides. Clothes were commonly coloured deep crimson for decoration. Cuman men wore distinguishing conical felt or leather hats, pointed at the top with a broad brim (if made of felt) or a fur trim around the base (if made of leather). The brim of the hat formed a sharp angle at the front and upturned on the rear and at the sides. Women wore a large variety of head dresses and also wore conical hats but with a felt top and a cloth veil extending down the back. This veil only covered the back neck and not the hair or face; another source states that it did cover the hair and that sometimes one or two braids were visible. Women wore a variety of jewellery, such as torques, a type of neck ornament consisting of one or several metal strands attached to a ribbon or necklace and hung around the neck, and head dresses that were made of a series of silver rings on a solid, cylindrically shaped material that was fastened at the temples. The men shaved the top of their head, {{while the rest of the}} hair was plaited into several braids; they also had prominent moustaches. Other Cumans also wore their hair very long, without shaving the top. The women had their hair loose or braided with buns twisting at the side. Both men and women followed a tradition of braiding coloured ribbons into their hair. For footwear, Cuman men and women wore long leather or felt boots with support straps connected to their belt. Both men and women wore cloth or metal arm bands.|$|E
