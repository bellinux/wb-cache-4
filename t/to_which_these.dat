5|$|In 533, taking {{advantage}} of the absence of the Vandal fleet, sent to suppress a revolt in Sardinia, an army of 15,000 under Belisarius was transported to Africa by an invasion fleet of 92 dromons and 500 transports, beginning the Vandalic War, the first of the wars of reconquest of Emperor Justinian I (527–565). These were largely amphibious operations, made possible by the control of the Mediterranean waterways, and the fleet played a vital role in carrying supplies and reinforcements to the widely dispersed Byzantine expeditionary forces and garrisons. This fact was not lost on the Byzantines' enemies. Already in the 520s, Theodoric had planned to build a massive fleet directed against the Byzantines and the Vandals, but his death in 526 limited the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>these</b> plans were realized. In 535, the Gothic War began with a double-pronged Byzantine offensive, with a fleet again carrying Belisarius' army to Sicily and then Italy, and another army invading Dalmatia. Byzantine control of the sea was of great strategic importance, allowing the smaller Byzantine army to successfully occupy the peninsula by 540.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>these</b> sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E

25|$|Other non-Marxist critics {{argued that}} Cohen, {{in line with}} the Marxist tradition, underestimated the role played by the legal and {{political}} superstructure in shaping the character of the economic base.

Cohen recognised and accepted some, though not all, of these criticisms in his History, Labour, and Freedom (1988).|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of PIE was first postulated in the 18th century by Sir William Jones, who observed {{the similarities between}} Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and Latin. By the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions of PIE had been developed that are still accepted today (with some refinements). The largest developments of the 20th century were {{the discovery of the}} Anatolian and Tocharian languages and the acceptance of the laryngeal theory. The Anatolian languages have also spurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various shared Indo-European language features and the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>these</b> features were present in PIE itself. Relationships to other language families, including the Uralic languages, have been proposed but remain controversial.|$|E
25|$|However, this varied handcraft {{tradition}} faces challenges. Like {{other areas}} of Mexico, handcrafted goods must compete against cheaper, commercially made products and cheaper imitations. One problem that many artisans have, especially those who sell more expensive items such as furniture, is the inability to extend lines of credit. Michoacan artisans lack access to markets to sell and avenues to promote their products. One main market <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>these</b> artisans lack access is the tourism industry, valuable to other states in Mexico such as Oaxaca. One important reason {{for the lack of}} tourism is security concerns. As of 2012 11,640 artisans worked in the state, but most have income below the poverty line.|$|E

The extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>these</b> drolls were performed {{is almost impossible to}} tell. Some of the contents of The Wits were almost certainly edited by Kirkman from the many play scripts he owned. However, some of the drolls are known from versions that date before 1620. This suggests that, like so many plays, they existed in manuscript for many years before they were published. One droll, The Lame Commonwealth, a canting interlude extracted from The Beggars Bush, includes an additional section which seems to record stagecraft. Another droll from The Wits, Daphilo & Granida, is based on the play Granida by P.C. Hooft. Baskervill (1924) notes that a Christmas play collected from Keynsham, Somerset in 1822 contains a passage exhibiting a striking similarity to a passage from Daphilo & Granida, which suggests the text of Kirkman's droll was adapted for use in the folk play.|$|E
