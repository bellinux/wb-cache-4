5|$|After its {{suspension}} {{with the}} December 1798 issue, <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review lay dormant {{until it was}} briefly revived as <b>The</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review (New Series) {{during the first six}} months of 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures. This series lasted only from January until June 1799.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most important, <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review {{provided}} {{a forum for}} radical political and religious ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review, was founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public {{as well as to}} simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E

5|$|The demises of the Theological Repository and the New Review left a {{publishing}} vacuum; the arrival in London {{of the author}} Thomas Christie, who was dedicated to starting a new periodical that would replace and perhaps even improve upon these precursors, was the primary impetus {{in the creation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review. Johnson and Christie were mutual friends of Priestley and others, and their combined interest in beginning such a journal resulted in the foundation of <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review.|$|E
5|$|A second {{forerunner of}} <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review was Paul Henry Maty's {{periodical}} A New Review (published 1782–86), which was likewise devoted to reviewing books and offering {{a summary of}} their contents. Like its successor, the New Review paid special attention to foreign literature and took {{a leading role in}} introducing German literature to the British public.|$|E
5|$|Geddes, {{who contributed}} {{from the first}} issue, wrote forty-six articles, almost all on topics of biblical {{criticism}} or ecclesiastical history.

5|$|Organized into {{separate}} departments, {{each with its}} own chief reviewer, <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review focused on politics, philosophy, natural history, and literature. To promote a disinterested air, its reviewers were anonymous, signing their work with pseudonymous initials. Nevertheless, the journal recruited several prominent writers, such as the poet William Cowper, the moralist William Enfield, the physician John Aikin and the polemicist Mary Wollstonecraft.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edward Conroy, 2nd Baronet (6 December 1809 – 3 November 1869), married Lady Alice Parsons, {{daughter}} of Laurence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse. They were {{the parents of}} <b>the</b> <b>analytical</b> chemist Sir John Conroy, 3rd Baronet.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review offered {{its readers}} {{access to a}} wide variety of works. In July 1789, when the Bastille fell, <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> {{reviewed}} The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire, Life of Thomas Chatterton, Transactions in Bengal, Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast, Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera, and Histoire Politique de la Revolution en France. The journal also laid provocative facts before the public to prompt them to think and, if necessary, to take action, although it claimed not to advocate one viewpoint over another. For example, when philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke issued his politically controversial Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review reviewed it extensively, as well as the many responses to it, such as Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), Vindiciae Gallicae (1791) by James Mackintosh, and Rights of Man (1791) by Thomas Paine. However, the majority of the excerpts that the reviewers chose to publish came from the rebuttals to Burke's work.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Grenby, the {{foremost}} expert on Trimmer, {{estimates that the}} Guardians circulation was between 1,500 and 3,500 copies per issue. Thus the Guardians circulation was probably comparable to political periodicals such as the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic, which both reached 3,500 by 1797, or <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review, which reached about 1,500, {{but not to the}} Monthly Review, which reached approximately 5,000. From June 1802 until January 1804, the Guardian appeared monthly; from then until it ceased publication in September 1806, it was issued quarterly. There were 28 issues in all.|$|E
5|$|Originally, in Tolkien's {{writings}} {{from the}} 1910s and 1920s, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë (their final names) were {{the eldest of}} the Elves.

Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë now became the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves. This text only saw print in The War of the Jewels, part of <b>the</b> <b>analytical</b> The History of Middle-earth series, in 1994, but a similar version was included in The Silmarillion in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The Whig Monthly Review, {{founded in}} 1749 by Ralph Griffiths, and the Tory Critical Review, founded in 1756 by Tobias Smollett, {{were the first}} {{journals}} dedicated to reviewing books in Britain. Although {{they were joined by}} smaller publications such as <b>the</b> <b>Analytical</b> Review, these two journals dominated reviewing {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century. They focused on poetry, novels, drama, belles-lettres, travel literature, biographies, science writing and other forms of popular literature. They did not review many complex theological or scholarly works, particularly those in foreign languages.|$|E
