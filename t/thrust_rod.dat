To {{research}} the mechanical performance and vibration modes of current longitudinal <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> of rear axle, the {{finite element model}} of original <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> is established and analyzed with NASTRAN codes. The simulation results demonstrate: the maximum stress of original <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> of dump truck is {{in the limit of}} the yield strength of material, which satisfies with the design requirements; the first step modal frequency of the component under free conditions is greater than upper limits value of the excited frequency of roads, which can evade the resonance excited by irregular roads. But there is structural stress concentration area in the <b>thrust</b> <b>rod,</b> so the structure of <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> is modified to ameliorate the stress state of this area. The maximum structural stress is reduced by 35. 1 % on the basis of reduction by 4. 7 % in total weight, which indicates the modification improves the mechanical and modal performance greatly. The research above has significant reference values for mechanical performance analysis and lightweight design of complicated automotive components...|$|E
40|$|A {{hydraulically}} actuated {{device is}} described for applying a test load to a bearing {{or the like}} to prove the integrity of its mounting or staking within a bore in a housing such as gear case. To accommodate limited access situations, the device is constructed in a right angle configuration in which a hydraulic cylinder applies axial pressure to a first <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> assemly which includes a first <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> through a threated spindle driving a linearly translated cam. Cam follower wheel transfers the translation to a second <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> assembly which includes a horizontal shaft and a spindle within a cross-arm housing portion and a tubular housing portion. The same second thrust direction applies the bearing loading in either of two directions depending upon {{the shape of the}} interface parts. The interface parts can bear on the bearing from either side with respect to the bearing mounting structural part...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the fatigue life prediction method of the <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> based on the continuum damage mechanics. The equivalent stress used as damage parameters established rubber fatigue life prediction model. Through the finite element simulation and material test, the model parameters and the fatigue damage dangerous positions were obtained. By equivalent stress life model, uniaxial fatigue life of the V-type <b>thrust</b> <b>rod</b> is analyzed to predict the ratio of life and the life of the test was 1. 73, within an acceptable range, and the fatigue damage occurring position and finite element analysis are basically the same. Fatigue life analysis shows that the method is of correct, theoretical, and practical value...|$|E

And then, since I still refused, the executioner was recalled, he crossed my arms upon my breast, bound them securely, <b>thrust</b> a long <b>rod</b> beneath the cord, and, seizing one end of this in either hand, gave the first turn.|$|R
50|$|Flange mounts—Very {{strong and}} rigid, but have little {{tolerance}} for misalignment. Experts recommend cap end mounts for <b>thrust</b> loads and <b>rod</b> end mounts where major loading puts the piston rod in tension. Three types are head rectangular flange, head square flange or rectangular head. Flange mounts function optimally when the mounting face attaches to a machine support member.|$|R
40|$|Experiments on a pulsed {{microwave}} thruster {{were conducted}} using a 1 MW gyrotron {{developed by the}} Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. The pulsed microwave, whose duration is 0. 2 ~ 1 msec, was focused by a parabolic mirror/nozzle and air-breakdown was induced. Precise optical alignment was not necessary to produce plasma using an ignition <b>rod.</b> <b>Thrust</b> impulse is measured using a load cell force transducer. As a result, the maximum momentum coupling coefficient, Cm was 28 N/MW at 0. 2 msec pulse width. Cm varied inversely with the pulse width...|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the three lads were {{swimming}} out towards the rocks which, as Francis had anticipated, rose from twenty to thirty feet above the level of the sea. The water deepened fast, and for the last thirty or forty yards, they were unable to touch the bottom, even when <b>thrusting</b> down their <b>rods</b> to the fullest depth. They then tried the depth in the passages {{at the end of the}} rocks, and found that there was ample water for the Lido. When they ascertained this to their satisfaction they swam back to the shore.|$|R
60|$|For {{half an hour}} he {{roamed the}} arena, which was the {{greatest}} area of restricted freedom he had known in the ten weeks of his captivity. Then, a hooked iron <b>rod,</b> <b>thrust</b> through the bars, caught and drew the bight of his trailing rope {{into the hands of}} the men outside. Immediately ten of them had hold of it, and he would have charged up to the bars at them had not, at that moment, Mulcachy entered the arena through a door on the opposite side. No bars stood between Ben Bolt and this creature, and Ben Bolt charged him. Even as he charged he was aware of suspicion in that the small, fragile man-creature before him did not flee or crouch down, but stood awaiting him.|$|R
50|$|When detonated, {{the high}} {{explosive}} imparts momentum to the <b>rods,</b> <b>thrusting</b> them outward in an expanding circle. The rods are sufficiently soft (ductile) {{to allow the}} expansion without breaking the rods or the welded joints, and the detonation velocity is limited to under 1,150 m/s, allowing the rods to bend at these locations instead. At some intermediate point the ring will have a zig-zag (alternating direction) appearance within a cylindrical envelope. Upon ultimate expansion the ring is circular and contained within a plane. The ring will then break and ultimately tend to form one or more straight rods. Since the net momentum of the rod relative to the missile is roughly zero its effectiveness will rapidly diminish as the broken ring expands.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{crawling}} in-pipe robot {{was designed}} to improve the adaptive ability with self-locking principle applied. In the moving, the robot was adaptable to horizontal, vertical and bending pipes with different diameters and sections without exerting additional pressure to the shell. The robot used a telescopic umbrella stand as a basic structure. The force of telescopic mechanism, self-locking principle of supporting mechani sm and shell were deduced from design requirements. The design of supporting and coupling mechanism was completed. The relationship between screw <b>rod</b> <b>thrust</b> and parallelogram driving force was established. A prototype was made and tested according to the suggested design methods. The {{results show that the}} robot with powerful traction, good self-locking performance and smooth passage through curve can move forward in the pipe with 90 ~ 150 mm inner diameter...|$|R
40|$|An {{electrical}} {{servo actuator}} {{is mounted on}} a support arm which is allowed to pivot on a bolt through a fixed mounting bracket. The actuator is pivotally connected {{to the end of}} the support arm by a bolt which has an extension allowed to pass through a slot in the fixed mounting bracket. An actuator rod extends from the servo actuator to a crank arm which turns a control shaft. A short linear <b>thrust</b> of the <b>rod</b> pivots the crank arm through about 90 for full-on control with the rod contracted into the servo actuator, and full-off control when the rod is extended from the actuator. A spring moves the servo actuator and actuator rod toward the control crank arm once the actuator rod is fully extended in the full-off position. This assures the turning of the control shaft to a full-off position. A stop bolt and slot are provided to limit pivot motion. Once fully extended, the spring pivots the motion...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 July, Alamo {{concluded}} {{her visit}} to Hawaii and resumed the voyage to the Orient. En route, further troubles {{surfaced in the}} boilers of her main propulsion plant so that, upon her arrival in Subic Bay on 20 July, she commenced another round of repairs. The dock landing ship carried out post-repair trials {{during the last week}} in August and finally departed Subic Bay on 24 August. Alamo reached Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 27 August and began embarking Marines for transportation to Japan. Between 28 August and 16 September, the amphibious warship made two round-trip voyages between Okinawa and Japan carrying Marines to and from training exercises. On 18 September, she stood out of Buckner Bay on her way to Inchon, Korea. During the period 18 September to 13 October, she made three round-trip voyages between Okinawa and South Korean ports. Upon her return to Okinawa from the third of those assignments, a problem with her stern gate was due to a maneuver consisting of a 90-degree turn with the rear gate down in the water at 15 knots. The force ripped one of the hinges and a hydraulic <b>rod</b> <b>thrust</b> out the back side end causing her to be tied up with repairs until 2November. At that time she headed back to Korea to participate in the bilateral exercise [...] "Operation Valiant Blitz 85-1" [...] in cooperation with elements of the South Korean Navy and Marine Corps. Following stops at Buckner Bay and Sasebo, Japan, Alamo began the voyage back to the United States {{at the end of the}} third week in November. The dock landing ship made the usual call at Pearl Harbor and then reentered San Diego on 6 December.|$|R
60|$|As I have {{mentioned}} our famous pigeon-pies, when describing the dovecote, I {{may as well}} conclude this chapter with a fuller account of our way of living as to food, a fascinating subject to most persons. The psychologists tell us a sad truth when they say that taste, being the lowest or least intellectual of our five senses, is incapable of registering impressions on the mind; consequently we cannot recall or recover vanished flavours as we can recover, and mentally see and hear, long past sights and sounds. Smells, too, when we cease smelling, vanish and return not, only we remember that blossoming orange grove where we once walked, and beds of wild thyme and penny- royal when {{we sat on the}} grass, also flowering bean and lucerne fields, filled and fed us, body and soul, with delicious perfumes. In like manner we can recollect the good things we consumed long years ago--the things we cannot eat now because we are no longer capable of digesting and assimilating them; it is like recalling past perilous adventures by land and water in the brave young days when we loved danger for its own sake. There was, for example, the salad of cold sliced potatoes and onions, drenched in oil and vinegar, a glorious dish with cold meat to go to bed on! Also hot maize-meal cakes eaten with syrup at breakfast, and other injudicious cakes. As a rule it was a hot breakfast and midday dinner; an afternoon tea, with hot bread and scones and peach-preserve, and a late cold supper. For breakfast, mutton cutlets, coffee, and things made with maize. Eggs were plentiful--eggs of fowl, duck, goose, and wild fowl's eggs--wild duck and plover in their season. In spring--August to October--we occasionally had an ostrich or rhea's egg {{in the form of a}} huge omelette at breakfast, and it was very good. The common native way of cooking it by <b>thrusting</b> a <b>rod</b> heated red through the egg, then burying it in the hot ashes to complete the cooking, did not commend itself to us. From the end of July to the end of September we feasted on plovers' eggs at breakfast. In appearance and taste they were precisely like our lapwings' eggs, only larger, the Argentine lapwing being a bigger bird than its European cousin. In those distant days the birds were excessively abundant all over the pampas where sheep were pastured, for at that time there were few to shoot wild birds and nobody ever thought of killing a lapwing for the table. The country had not then been overrun by bird-destroying immigrants from Europe, especially by Italians. Outside of the sheep zone in the exclusively cattle-raising country, where the rough pampas grasses and herbage had not been eaten down, the plover were sparsely distributed.|$|R
60|$|In one {{of those}} corners of our land canopied by the fumes of blind industry, there was, on that day, a lull in darkness. A fresh wind had split the {{customary}} heaven, or roof of hell; was sweeping long drifts of creamy clouds across a blue still pallid with reek. The sun even shone--a sun whose face seemed white and wondering. And under that rare sun all the little town, among its slag heaps and few tall chimneys, had an air of living faster. In those continuous courts and alleys, where the women worked, smoke from each little forge rose and dispersed into the wind with strange alacrity; amongst the women, too, there was that same eagerness, for the sunshine had crept in and was making pale all those dark-raftered, sooted ceilings which covered them in, together with their immortal comrades, the small open furnaces. About their work they had been busy since seven o'clock; their feet pressing the leather lungs which fanned the conical heaps of glowing fuel, their hands poking into the glow a thin iron rod till the end could be curved into a fiery hook; snapping it with a mallet; threading it with tongs on to the chain; hammering, closing the link; and; without a second's pause, <b>thrusting</b> the iron <b>rod</b> again into the glow. And while they worked they chattered, laughed sometimes, now and then sighed. They seemed {{of all ages and}} all types; from her who looked like a peasant of Provence, broad, brown, and strong, to the weariest white consumptive wisp; from old women of seventy, with straggling grey hair, to fifteen-year-old girls. In the cottage forges there would be but one worker, or two at most; in the shop forges four, or even five, little glowing heaps; four or five of the grimy, pale lung-bellows; and never a moment without a fiery hook about to take its place on the growing chains, never a second when the thin smoke of the forges, and of those lives consuming slowly in front of them, did not escape from out of the dingy, whitewashed spaces past the dark rafters, away to freedom.|$|R
