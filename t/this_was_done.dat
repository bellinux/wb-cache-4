5|$|In late 2007 {{and early}} 2008, several Russian newspapers, {{including}} Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Nezavisimaya Gazeta printed stories that implicated the Nazis in the crime, spurring concern that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with the tacit {{approval of the}} Kremlin. As a result, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance decided to open its own investigation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{the battery}} near St. Peter Bastion was {{demolished}} and a gateway {{known as the}} Għarreqin Gate was opened within the Magazine Curtain. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> {{in order to facilitate}} access to the newly-built railway station located nearby. The fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925.|$|E
50|$|When {{wavenumber}} {{is represented}} by the symbol , a frequency is still being represented, albeit indirectly.

5|$|In the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status {{not just}} to {{complete}} pacifists, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors {{that occurred during the}} First World War.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 47 Ursae Majoris c was discovered by detecting changes in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> Pedro de Alvarado sent Juan de Chávez, {{one of his}} trusted officers, at {{the head}} of 40–50 Spanish {{soldiers}} and some 1500–2000 native auxiliaries to explore the mountainous interior of the province, and find a good, defensible location for a new colonial capital, ideally to provide a communication route between Higueras and Guatemala.|$|E

50|$|While many {{models are}} {{adjusted}} to better fit historical data, traditionally <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> in campaigns or during initial design, and often <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> either manually {{or with a}} combination of mathematical and manual methods.

5|$|The Sihanaka {{are one of}} the few Malagasy {{groups who}} {{historically}} branded their cattle. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> by clipping the clipping the ear of the cow and was a religious act conducted once annually on a dedicated day of feasting. Cattle generally belonged to the community as a whole and were used principally to assist with farming.|$|E
5|$|The camera's {{resolution}} is two-and-a-half {{times higher than}} the handheld's screens. However, their {{resolution is}} considerably lower than contemporaneous digital cameras and mobile phones. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to help keep their price reasonable and to maintain a preferable response time for viewing photos in quick session, particularity since numerous applications will use them.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of wearing}} a {{conventional}} belt, skateboarders often wear shoelaces in belt loops {{to hold their}} trousers up. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> mostly for fashion, {{but it is also}} useful because belt buckles often dig into a skater's stomach when skating. Since shoelaces do not require belt buckles, <b>this</b> digging <b>is</b> avoided. Another reason <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to avoid the excessive pain belts can cause if a skateboarder should fall.|$|R

50|$|County champions are {{determined}} {{as a result}} of the cumulative number of points earned within a team's County. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> at the conclusion of each years schedule, when points are tallied and awards are handed out at the respective Counties Captain's dinner for that year. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.|$|R
5|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} from Hastings to Ore in 1935. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> {{in order that}} trains could be serviced in a siding away from the centre of Hastings; this has since closed. Electrification through to Ashford was planned, but abandoned in 1939 when the war started.|$|E
5|$|Three brigades of the Force Publique {{were sent}} to Abyssinia {{alongside}} British forces to fight the Italians in June 1940. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> {{in spite of the}} government in exile's reservations, to demonstrate its allegiance to the Allied cause and in retaliation for the deployment of Italian bombers in bases on the channel coast within occupied Belgium.|$|E
5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change was}} the {{transition}} to the use of judges as the electoral returning officer for South Australia. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to impose state control on a system which had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral rolls. On 27 May 1925, Denny arranged the appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, {{it has been suggested that}} it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when the threat from the Arabs increased.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named for whatever reason, it would've received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1958, I-75 in Michigan was {{constructed}} in several discontinuous segments. M-76 was {{to become one of}} the portions incorporated into the route of I-75. Although other portions of I-75 were completed and designated in noncontiguous segments, the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M-76 and the entire stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I-75. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> while a temporary connecting ToI-75 designation between Bay City and Grayling followed a different path along US10 and US127.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn's other accomplishments {{included}} {{establishing a}} state railroad commission and reorganizing the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College.

5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls.
