5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E
5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was {{produced}} by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for Ace Attorney, {{was in charge of}} the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes. While the original Ace Attorney Investigations had taken longer than usual for an Ace Attorney game to develop due to its several new gameplay systems that had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations 2 went faster due to it already having a base game to build upon, resulting in the developers being able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> focus on the game's story. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, one of the major changes compared to the first Ace Attorney Investigations was the addition of an interrogation game mechanic; they chose to present it metaphorically as a game of chess, which was Edgeworth's favorite game. Another such change was the graphical improvements to the game's sprites and background art.|$|E
5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E

Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!.|$|E

State lawmakers have proposed eliminating the individual redevelopment agencies, {{a move that would}} force cities such as Burbank to eliminate much needed infrastructure projects. Local redevelopment agencies also may be forced to reimburse the state. For example, Burbank Redevelopment Agency might have pay the state nearly $20 million. But the city is fighting the return of at least $15 million in redevelopment funds, including money that was slated for the Lundigan Community Center and improvements to Johnny Carson Park. Whether Burbank will ultimately prevail is unclear, as the state's budget hole is getting worse due to the slow economy and lower than expected state revenues.|$|E

25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E
25|$|In the Battle of Montmirail on 11 February, Napoleon moved against Sacken's 18,000 Russians and 90 guns west of Montmirail with Ricard's {{division}} and some cavalry. After being {{driven out of}} Marchais at 11:00 am, Ricard's division was ordered to recapture the village. After a furious struggle that raged until 2:00 pm, Marchais remained in Russian hands. By this time Ney's corps arrived <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> pressure on the Russians. The French finally captured Marchais {{and most of its}} defenders were cut down by French cavalry as they fled. Escaping to the north with difficulty, Sacken lost 2,800 men, six colors and 13 guns while Yorck's Prussians sustained 900 casualties. The French lost 2,000 killed and wounded. At Montmirail Ricard's division consisted of the one battalion each of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th and 16th Light Infantry and the 22nd, 40th, 50th, 65th, 136th, 138th, 142nd, 144th and 145th Line Infantry.|$|E

Hill was temporarily assigned the 3rd Division. On Hill's left was the 25,400-man corps of William Beresford with the 4th, 6th, 7th and Light Divisions plus the cavalry brigades of Vivian and Somerset. Hill's main column headed east for Hélette while Picton's 3rd Division marched toward Bonloc on the north and Morillo's division moved through the foothills farther south. In the face of this threat, Harispe's division at Hélette abandoned the line of the Joyeuse and fell back toward the Bidouze River at Saint-Palais. With his left flank uncovered, Villatte, facing Picton's 3rd Division, also backpedaled to the Bidouze.|$|E

There being of such bath regions make the mesh domain of Poisson equation large and leads to either {{a large number of}} grid points with fine mesh resolution or a small number of grid points with very coarse discretization. From bulk simulations a coarse mesh is sufficient for describing the baths using the P3M scheme. However, a fine resolution is required in the channel domain because of the highly charged nature of these regions and {{the presence of}} spatially varying dielectric regions. Besides the ultimate interest is to study the channel behavior in terms of ion permeability, selectivity, gating, density, etc.… In other words, it is better off <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> computational resources in the channel region, and bare minimum in the baths to reduce the overall computational cost and speed up our simulations from weeks to perhaps days instead.|$|E
25|$|Shawn Layden {{formally}} reintroduced The Last Guardian at {{the beginning}} of Sony's E3 2015 conference. Sony affirmed that that game was now slated for release on the PlayStation 4 with a 2016 release date. Sony also assured fans that Ueda still remained a main developer of the game despite his prior departure from Sony. According to Chris Plante of Polygon, the gameplay presented shows the same gameplay from previous demos, where the young boy and the large creature work together to solve various platforming puzzles. The presentation at the 2015 E3 was based on the milestone of the game being fully playable, affirmed by selected members of the press, though Yoshida stated they did not do a live gameplay demo as the artificial intelligence behavior of the animal creature could be sporadic and impact the demonstration. Ueda said that the fundamentals of the gameplay had not changed from the original PlayStation 3 version to the PlayStation 4, only that with the more-powerful PlayStation 4, they were able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> detail into the characters and the environment.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Caras {{was signed}} to a {{contract}} with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). In his first test in the company, Caras competed in the 2005 La Copa Junior, but the storyline of the tournament saw him defeated in the semi-final by Dr. Wagner Jr. Caras's advancement to the semi-final of the cup, mere months after signing with the company was an indicator that the bookers were interested in elevating him up the rankings, this was further supported when he received matches for both the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship and the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship inside a three-week period. The following year on March 31, 2006 Caras was entered again into the La Copa Junior tournament and earned a return victory over Dr. Wagner Jr. who knocked {{him out of the}} tournament the previous year. He also won against Heavy Metal and Apolo Dantés to gain a place in the final, defeating Héctor Garza to win the prize. While working in Japan, Caras had taken to teaming with another second-generation wrestler, Lizmark Jr., and when both found themselves in CMLL they were teamed up once again with the team's famous fathers being the selling point. Over the next year Caras found himself without much direction, he worked storylines with Último Guerrero and Kenzo Suzuki but nothing long term came of it. Caras received two opportunities to challenge Universo 2000 for the CMLL World Heavyweight title but came up short until his third attempt on July 8, 2007 when he became the CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. While in wrestling promotions outside of Mexico the Heavyweight title would indicate that he was the top man in the federation, Mexican wrestling promotions tend <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>more</b> emphasis on the lower weight divisions over the heavyweights.|$|E
