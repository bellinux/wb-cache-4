The paper also investigates more intangibles-related issues, such as goodwill, R&D, plus the profitability of companies which have intangible assets. The sample consists of 241 UK industrial firms that are listed on the London Stock Exchange, while the period under analysis is 1 January to 31 December 2005, with some exceptions to spring or summer of 2006 with relative starting date. The study shows that the firms that have intangible assets have improved key financial measures such as leverage, profitability and growth rather that the firms <b>that</b> <b>haven</b> <b>t.</b> Firms with intangible assets would tend to borrow more often and try to expand more. For example, the study indicates that large firms with intangible assets would pay a larger dividend per share {{in order to attract}} investors whilst they are having liquidity problems and their debt ratios are larger than those <b>that</b> <b>haven</b> <b>t.</b> However, the results show that firms that present intangible assets at their balance sheet tend to exhibit more favourable financial results compared to firms that don t. Similar findings are obtained for firms that have goodwill and R&D expenses. The more profitable firms are usual to have intangible assets rather than the firms that are less profitable. The IAS 38 is being implemented thoroughly, by the firms at the London Stock Exchange at least, and it shows the strength behind the intellectual capital, brand names, goodwill, investments on projects and the means to more profitable results...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, more {{countries}} have increasingly turned to explicit, codified trade policy instruments {{of the international}} trading system such as antidumping measures. Countries have also increasingly participated in the institutions established to facilitate trade in the international system, such as the WTO s Dispute Settlement Understanding. Given these phenomena, a natural question to consider is why <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> countries resorted to the WTO s safeguards provisions at a similar pace? This paper focuses on the economic incentives generated by reforms in the Uruguay Round, and argues {{that in order to}} address the relative unpopularity of the application of safeguards measures, further reforms must be made to WTO s Antidumping Agreement and the rules of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. ...|$|R
