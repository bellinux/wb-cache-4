5|$|The palace {{building}} {{consists of}} four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A carved wooden gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan took from a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected {{at the entrance of}} the palace. The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to the front lawn of the palace, which was used by the musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling of the palace is crafted with designs using chisel and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> around the palace. Other notable rooms of the palace include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to <b>the</b> <b>lawns.</b> The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of roller based manual lawn edgers. Both are driven by pushing a roller wheel along a hard surface {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> edge. One type causes a solid steel cutting disc to cut the edge of <b>the</b> <b>lawn.</b> <b>The</b> other type causes two star spoked discs to rotate against each other shear cutting the edge of <b>the</b> <b>lawn.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{students}} {{living on}} <b>the</b> <b>Lawn</b> open up their doors to {{children of the}} community for trick or treating on Halloween each year. Students started the tradition in the 1980s. Families and children align the 54 rooms surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Lawn</b> while <b>the</b> <b>Lawn</b> residents and other students stand outside each room and give candy to the children. The event usually has a turn out of hundreds of children trick-or-treating and many organizations donate candy to help out <b>the</b> <b>Lawn</b> residents for <b>the</b> event.|$|R

5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The chairs are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because no one wanted to try to move it.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess how the {{proportion}} of dicotyledons in <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> was influenced by aboveground biomass containing Festuca rubra, cv. ‘Areta’, ‘Nimba’, and ‘Olivia’, cut and left on <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> surface. This influence was evaluated based on the changes in the species composition of <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> sward. In <b>the</b> control treatments, the cut turf was removed from <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> surface immediately after cutting. The study showed that the botanical composition of <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> varied and depended on the cultivar of F. rubra and the assessment date. In the treatments where the cut turf with F. rubra ‘Areta’ and ‘Olivia’ was not removed, grasses were found to have a higher proportion than dicotyledons and other unsown species, both in the spring and autumn. In the treatments with ‘Nimba’, this effect was only observed in the autumn. ‘Nimba’ demonstrated the greatest ability to limit the proportion of dicotyledons in <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> sward...|$|R

25|$|Lawn rollers are {{designed}} to even out or firm up <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> surface, especially in climates where heaving causes <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> to be lumpy.

25|$|Dunn sold Belcourt to Elaine and Louis Lorillard in 1954 for $22,500. The Lorillards, {{of tobacco}} fame, envisioned Belcourt as a seat for the Newport Jazz Festival. <b>The</b> <b>lawns</b> on Bellevue Avenue could {{accommodate}} over 10,000 and the masonry and stucco façade provided an acoustic background. The large central courtyard {{was the scene}} for concerts with the open loggia providing further room for spectators. Inside, the massive rooms were used for workshops and lodging. However, the future for Belcourt as a permanent venue for the festival was dim.|$|E
25|$|William Saunders planned Gettysburg National Cemetery. He {{enclosed}} it with {{a massive}} stone wall, <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> were framed by trees and shrubs. The graves were {{laid out in a}} great semicircle, state by state, around the site for a sculptured central feature, a Soldier's National Monument. The Soldier's National Cemetery, as it was then called, was dedicated by President Abraham Lincoln on November 19, 1863. The speaker's platform occupied the site set aside for the Soldier's National Monument, then awaiting future design. The immortal words of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address gave this spot a historical and patriotic association. Gettysburg National Cemetery became the honored property of the nation on May 1, 1872, now a century ago.|$|E
25|$|This {{includes}} the tree-flanked sloping lawns {{to the south}} of the House down to the Octagon Lake and {{a mile and a half}} beyond to the Corinthian Arch beyond which stretches the Grand Avenue of over a mile and a half to Buckingham. This is the oldest area of the gardens. There were walled gardens on the site of the south lawn from the 1670s that belonged to the old house. These gardens were altered in the 1680s when the house was rebuilt on the present site. They were again remodelled by Bridgeman from 1716. <b>The</b> <b>lawns</b> with the flanking woods took on their current character from 1741 when 'Capability' Brown re-landscaped this area.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, {{the station}} {{came under the}} control of New Jersey Transit (NJT), the public agency which had taken over {{commuter}} rail in the state from Conrail. That year, the depot was renovated heavily along with other stations in the state; the goal was to encourage the borough to take over operating and maintaining the station building. NJT installed new structural support beams {{on the west side of}} the depot, creating a new foundation for the depot, replacing walls, floors and gutters. The exterior was stuccoed. However, the unused service windows and general unkemptness persisted afterward. Five years later, NJT installed new low-level platforms at the depot, replacing the sidewalks and curbs and reseeding <b>the</b> <b>lawns.</b>|$|E
25|$|The central {{garden was}} {{redesigned}} by Kim Wilkie and opened as the John Madejski Garden on 5 July 2005. The design {{is a subtle}} blend of the traditional and modern: the layout is formal; there is an elliptical water feature lined in stone with steps around the edge which may be drained to use the area for receptions, gatherings or exhibition purposes. This {{is in front of}} the bronze doors leading to the refreshment rooms. A central path flanked by lawns leads to the sculpture gallery. The north, east and west sides have herbaceous borders along the museum walls with paths in front which continues along the south façade. In the two corners by the north façade there is planted an American Sweetgum tree. The southern, eastern and western edges of <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> have glass planters which contain orange and lemon trees in summer, which are replaced by bay trees in winter.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{creation}} of the promenade in 1884, there were several additions along the stretch. The country's first aquarium was established {{as one of the first}} additions in 1909. Shortly after the Independence, the Triumph of Labour statue and the Gandhi statue in 'march to Dandi' stride, which has been duplicated on <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> of the Parliament House, were erected on the beach. In 1968, a number of statues of icons of Tamil literature was erected to mark the first World Tamil Conference, including Avvaiyar, Tiruvalluvar, Kambar, Subramania Bharathiyar, Bharathidasan and the Europeans Bishop Caldwell, G.U. Pope and Veeramunivar. Anna memorial was built in 1970 and the MGR memorial in 1988, shortening the stretch at its northern end. More recent additions include the statues of Kamaraj and Shivaji Ganesan. In December 2016, then CM J. Jayalalithaa was also laid to rest here, very close to M.G.R. Memorial and a memorial for her is expected to be constructed within a year.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{recent survey}} work {{has shown that}} {{surviving}} waxcap grasslands are more extensive than in many other European countries, thanks mainly to large areas of unimproved upland sheep pastures and also to many unimproved lawns (especially in churchyards and country houses) and amenity grasslands. Nonetheless, five species characteristic of waxcap grasslands - Entoloma bloxamii, Hygrocybe calyptriformis, Hygrocybe spadicea, Geoglossum atropurpureum, and Microglossum olivaceum - are or {{have been the subject}} of national Biodiversity Action Plans and waxcap grasslands as a specific habitat are the subject of several local Biodiversity Action Plans. Waxcap grassland surveys have been undertaken by the British Mycological Society, the National Trust, Plantlife, and the various national conservation bodies. As a result, several waxcap grassland sites, such as the banks of Llanishen and Lisvane Reservoirs in Cardiff and <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> of Roecliffe Manor in Leicestershire, have been designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest, affording them some legal protection. A leaflet on managing waxcap grasslands in Britain and Ireland has been published by Plantlife and the Fungus Conservation Forum.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of the referendum began to flow to Aboriginal people in 1972. On 26 January 1972, Aboriginal peoples erected the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> of the Federal Parliament building in Canberra to express their frustration {{at the lack of}} progress on land rights and racial discrimination issues. This became a major confrontation that raised Aboriginal affairs high on the political agenda in the federal election later that year. One week after gaining office, the Whitlam Government (1972–1975) established a Royal Commission into land rights for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory under Justice Woodward. Its principal recommendations, delivered in May 1974, were: that Aboriginal people should have inalienable title to reserve lands; that regional Land Councils should be established; to establish a fund to purchase land with which Aboriginal people had a traditional connection, or that would provide economic or other benefits; prospecting and mineral exploration on Aboriginal land should only occur with their consent or that of the Federal Government if the national interest required it; entry onto Aboriginal land should require a permit issued by the regional Land Council. The recommendations were framed in terms to enable application outside the Northern Territory. The Federal Government agreed to implement the principal recommendations and in 1975 the House of Representatives passed the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill and the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill but the Senate had not considered them by the time parliament was dissolved in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Letchworth Croquet Club {{is based}} at Letchworth Sports and Tennis Club in Muddy Lane. Letchworth Garden City Croquet Club was founded in 1987 by {{a small group of}} enthusiasts {{and with the help of}} the (then) {{corporation}} were provided with a venue for their activities on the site of the old Spirella tennis courts adjacent to Willian Way. After much work on the playing surface, including using the ancient heavy roller left behind after the demise of the Spirella Sports Ground two nearly full-sized croquet lawns were created and the club members set about learning the finer points of the game with plenty of assistance from the East Anglian Croquet Association. Very surprisingly, after only two years the club won the Longman Cup, the premier national handicap competition; something that the majority of croquet clubs never achieve! The club moved to Muddy Lane to become part of Letchworth Sports and Tennis Club in Spring 2006. A special event was held with lunch and AC and GC tournaments. Dr Ian Vincent, Chairman of the Croquet Association, officially opened <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> by running the first hoop. Since moving the club's membership has risen to over 70 people with a wide age range. The club is active in regional and national events and each year hosts the national final of the Croquets Association's Inter Club Golf Croquet Championship. The croquet lawns at Letchworth were constructed with assistance from the Sports Turf Research Institute and were laser levelled and 76 tons of Leighton Buzzard washed sand ameliorated into the top surface. In the ensuing years the club has conducted a rigorous lawn maintenance regime with the result that the two lawns are now amongst the finest in the UK.|$|E
