5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{unfinished}} state, Catherine often {{visited the}} palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the gardens. According to the French military leader Marshal Tavannes, {{it was in}} the Tuileries gardens that she planned the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris. The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter Bernard Palissy. In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the Valois tapestries. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the crown of Poland to her son, the duke of Anjou, later Henry III of France. Henry IV later added to the Tuileries; but Louis XVI was to dismantle sections of the palace. The communards set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.|$|E

5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype {{had an average}} height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor. In {{the design of the}} character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall. As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> underwear at their homes.|$|E
5|$|Local labour was {{supplied}} by an Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) detachment, initially consisting of eight Australian Army officers and eleven native police. A {{week after the}} landing, 199 native labourers were brought in from Lae. Initially, the ANGAU detachment {{found it difficult to}} lure the frightened local people in from the bush, but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the American perimeter, large numbers began <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in.</b> ANGAU established a native settlement in the Biding River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work. They constructed camps for the Americans, carried supplies to units in the mountains and brought back the wounded, and worked in the hospital. ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E

5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels {{moved from one}} house to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to the}} main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure {{how to deal with the}} situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E
