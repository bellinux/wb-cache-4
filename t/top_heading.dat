40|$|The overall LHC project {{schedule}} requires the civil engineering work to begin {{before the final}} LEP shutdown. The new caverns for the ATLAS experiment will be built {{in and around the}} existing underground structures at point 1. In order to make the best possible use of the time available for the LHC civil engineering before the shutdown of LEP, a particular arrangement for the construction of the UX 15 cavern vault has been developed. The basic concept of this arrangement consists of the excavation of the cavern <b>top</b> <b>heading</b> and the installation of the concrete vault immediately afterwards, prior to the subsequent bench excavation after LEP shutdown. A temporary support of the dead weight of the concrete roof will be achieved by the suspension of the roof by 38 no. pre-stressed ground anchors of 225 tons capacity each. This support system will work up to the construction of the cavern base slab and walls and the completion of the permanent concrete lining...|$|E

40|$|Portal {{excavation}} in {{soft rock}} {{is one of}} the most challenging tasks in the construction of underground facilities. Significant convergence, collapses and surface settlement are usually associated with portal construction. Alluvium is loose unconsolidated material and most often tunnels constructed through tend to destabilize. In this study, portal excavation design has been analyzed using the finite element based computer program known as Phase 2. The method of <b>top</b> <b>heading</b> and benching was not a suitable approach, keeping in view the previous experience. Subsequently, a different design of sequential excavation method (SEM) was proposed. Minimum convergence, minimum surface settlement, and machinery constraints were considered to be the vital importance for selection of final design. The results of finite element method (FEM) analysis showed that the finally selected SEM design has a roof convergence of 4 mm for the heading and full face excavation has 25 mm. These values were comparable with the ones obtained from a 5 -pin convergence station, installed during the portal excavation (0. 5 m inside from the portal). No or very little surface settlement was shown by the numerical model and actual field observation. Consequently, a proper SEM design based on numerical modeling allowed a successful construction of a large portal in alluvial deposits...|$|E

40|$|A Centennial Campus {{is being}} {{developed}} at {{the western side of}} The University of Hong Kong Campus. The scope of this infrastructure project comprises the design, construction and commissioning of two new salt water and two new fresh water service reservoirs. Cavern was excavated in mostly tuff with intercalated tuffaceous sandstone to accommodate the new salt-water reservoir in a twin-cell tunnel system. With the requirements of minimal damage and disturbance to the rock mass during the excavation, it provided an ample opportunity to study the stress induced by the cavern as the excavation approached a virgin zone. This paper presents an evaluation of the magnitude of stresses acting on the crown of the large span tunnel at different stages of ground movement. Back analysis using two-dimensional finite element analysis was carried out based on the observed stress change and deformation resulted from approximately 6 m high <b>top</b> <b>heading</b> tunnel excavation to assess the deformation modulus of the bedrock and in-situ stress condition. The observed monitoring records also demonstrated that approximately 2 mm of vertical deformation was mobilized to provide an efficient temporary support to the tunnel crown. The induced stress calculated was in good agreement with those measured if a constant stress field (Ko > 1) was applied where the in-situ stresses were obtained from a nearby hydro-fracturing test.

40|$|The Aeschertunnel, a large noncircular shallow tunnel, was {{excavated}} using a jet grout arch {{for primary}} excavation support where glacial moraine was encountered. Surface deformations were monitored during jet grouting and as excavation of the <b>top</b> <b>heading</b> and bench proceeded. Observations {{of the construction}} process and the surface settlements suggest that the jet grouting arch limited the volume loss to 0. 35 %, similar to that achieved with slurry shield and EPB TBM. The surface settlement trough was considerably narrower than achieved using conventional tunneling methods. Numerical back-analysis suggests that the narrow settlement trough is created by localized shear bands induced by the over-pressure associated with the jet grout process. In soft ground tunneling the construction of large non-circular tunnels is particularly challenging. The construction method must provide worker safety as well as meet stringent design requirements. In an urban environment one of the design requirements is that the construction method must control surface settlement within specified tolerances. In Europe, a popular construction method for large non-circular tunnels utilizes sub-horizontal jet-grout columns to form a protective fan (vault) of cemented soil ahead of the excavation face. Jet-grouting has an advantage over many other construction techniques {{in its ability to}} be used in varying ground conditions and tunnel geometric configurations. The process of jet-grouting is a high energy process that replaces the soil with soil-cement slurry and, after hardening creates a 0. 6 m diameter column of soil-cement. As a result, in shallow tunnels the jet-grouting process may induce surface settlements that exceed the design requirements...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of a new four-year degree program at The University of Hong Kong, a Centennial Campus is being developed at the western side of the existing Main Campus. The scope of this infrastructure project comprises the design, construction and commissioning of two new salt water and two new fresh water service reservoirs. Cavern was excavated in sandstone and tuff to accommodate the new salt water reservoir in a twin-cell tunnel system. The cavern was constructed inside a sloping ground due to the need to find adequate rock cover. Starting at the portal, an about 30 m long, 7. 2 m span access tunnel was constructed and then separated into two reservoir tunnels. Two 10 m long transition zones were constructed and then the tunnels were enlarged from 7. 2 m span to 17 m span to create the cavern for the new salt water reservoir. With the requirements of minimal damage and disturbance to the rock mass during the excavation, it provided an ample opportunity to study the convergence of the cavern as the excavation approached an undisturbed zone. This paper presents an evaluation of the magnitude of stresses acting on the crown of the large span tunnel at different stages of ground movement. Back analysis was carried out based on the observed stresses and deformation resulted from approximately 6 m high <b>top</b> <b>heading</b> tunnel excavation. Two-dimensional finite element analysis program was utilized for this back analysis. Different empirical equations such as Bieniawski, Serafim and Pereira, Barton and Hoek et al. have been used in the numerical analysis to simulate the rock mass behaviors. It revealed that the Serafim and Pereira estimation was generally applicable for this particular HKU cavern project with volcanic tuff bedrock of as-mapped Q-value higher than 2. 3 or RMR value higher than 50. The observed monitoring records also demonstrated that approximately 2 mm of vertical deformation was mobilized to provide an efficient temporary support to the tunnel crown. Little stress relief and deformation was observed after the temporary rock support has been substantially mobilized. This paper presents a case-study of the rock behavior due to the underground opening. It also demonstrated the performance of immediate support to the tunnel crown in controlling the ground settlement and stress relaxation...|$|E
40|$|Due to diversified {{topography}} {{a number}} of tunnels have been constructed on Slovenian motorway network in the last 15 years after {{the implementation of the}} National motorway construction programme. 3 D displacement measurements of the primary lining has been applied {{as an integral part of}} the observational method on all tunnel construction sites since the Golovec tunnel construction in 1997. Analysis and interpretation of the measured displacements allow the verification of the design parameters, support optimization and optimization of construction processes. Monitoring data from the 13 tunnels, constructed after 1998, were collected and arranged in the database in the framework of this thesis together with face logs. Further on, a computer code Predor (means Tunnel in Slovene) was developed for graphical presentation and analysis of these data. Code comprises also a system for automatic handling of the incoming data from construction sites and for the preparation of graphical reports in real time. The main emphasis of the work was given to the analysis of measured displacements in tunnels, situated in soft foliated rock mass of Carboniferous age (the Trojane, Golovec and Šentvid tunnels). Monitored displacements display more or less pronounced anisotropic response in the cross section as well as in the longitudinal section. To model the observed response, back analyses with numerical calculations suggested very low value of shear modulus along the discontinuities. Special attention was paid to the analysis of well documented longitudinal displacements in the excavation direction under decreasing overburden due to anisotropy of the rock mass. It was found out that the magnitude of final measured displacements and thus portion of pre-displacements strongly depends on the relative discontinuity orientation to the tunnel axis. A large number of numerical simulations was performed to define the portion of pre-displacements and the extent of pre-face domain for different discontinuity orientations and different sets of material properties of the anisotropic rock mass. To locate the merging caverns of the Šentvid tunnel in most favourable rock mass conditions the exploratory tunnel was constructed in the design stage and enabled 3 D displacement measurements ahead of the <b>top</b> <b>heading</b> face of the main motorway tunnel during its construction. Extensive information about the scheme and execution of this experiment is given (no reports have been found so far of any similar experiments). Monitored displacements were analyzed according to mapped geological structure. Further on, the observed phenomena and the influence of the exploratory tunnel and its position on the displacements were studied with 3 D numerical calculations...|$|E
