5|$|Finally, a {{delegation}} of about 27workers was sent to Warsaw around June23. On the night of June26, the delegation returned to Poznań, confident that some of <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> had been considered in a favourable light. The Minister of Machine Industry met with the workers next morning and withdrew several promises that their delegation was given in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them that management refused <b>their</b> <b>demands,</b> was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of <b>their</b> <b>demands,</b> the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E
5|$|A {{key issue}} facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region {{and claimed that}} it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to <b>their</b> <b>demands,</b> insisting that the land remain Kenyan. In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.|$|E
50|$|Demand {{for some}} goods (called {{inferior}} goods) decreases with increasing wealth. For example, consider consumption of cheap fast food versus steak. As someone becomes wealthier, <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> for cheap fast food {{is likely to}} decrease, and <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> for more expensive steak may increase.|$|R

40|$|Many {{goods and}} {{services}} are priced non-linearly, and a common way to implement nonlinear price schedules is to let consumers choose from a menu of two-part tariffs. If consumers know <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> {{at the time they}} choose tariff, there is often no principal difference between a fully nonlinear shedule and a (rich enough) menu of two-part tariffs. When consumers do not know <b>their</b> exact <b>demand</b> the two are not equivalent, and this paper analyzes {{the pros and cons of}} forcing the consumers to choose tariff before they learn <b>their</b> <b>demand.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|A second labor action {{took place}} in July 1935, as {{construction}} on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.|$|E
5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, {{and that it would}} not be used for shading.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve <b>their</b> <b>demands.</b> The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} three related {{problems}} of the maximum capture (MAXCAP) model are proposed. These include the case where facilities provide {{a certain amount of}} service level for the customers, the possibility where customers do not allocate <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> completely to one facility but prorate <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> based on the service level, and finally we explore the situation where customers will not opt for sharing <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> irrespective of the service level if the next attractive facility is too far way which we express by a distance threshold. These models are put forward to mimic realistic situations related to customer behaviour when it comes to selecting a facility. Their respective mathematical formulations are put forward and tested on a case study and also over a range of larger data sets...|$|R
5|$|In 1869, Ontario Member of Parliament William McDougall was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories and sent to Fort Garry to establish formal governance for Canada. Before his party arrived at the settlement, a small group led by Louis Riel intercepted him near the Ontario border and forced him to turn back because they opposed the transfer to the Canadian government. The inhabitants of the Red River Valley began the Red River Rebellion, delaying formal governance until <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> for provincial status were met.|$|E

Following the concert, the band, following uniformed veterans from Iraq Veterans Against the War, led the 8,000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a 6-mile march to Invesco Field, host of the DNC. After a 4-hour stand-off with police, Obama's campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and hear <b>their</b> <b>demands.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 97 these {{tensions}} {{came to a}} {{head when}} the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to <b>their</b> <b>demands,</b> agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius, Domitian's former chamberlain, were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that in large economies with {{strongly}} convex preferences, the commodity bundles agents receive at core allocations are near <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> sets. Without convexity, it is know that agents need not be near <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> sets, although they will satisfy a weaker condition. In this paper, we show that, for "most" economies ({{in the sense of}} probability and {{in the sense of the}} Baire category theorem), the stronger form of approximation holds without convexity. ...|$|R

5|$|John's {{style of}} ruling, and his defeats in the Anglo-French War in 1214, had alienated {{many of his}} nobles. Initially, a faction of the barons forced John to agree to Magna Carta to secure less capricious {{government}} from the king. John, however, after agreeing to <b>their</b> <b>demands,</b> secured the annulment of the charter from the papacy in late 1215. The opposition magnates then invited Prince Louis of France to take the English throne, and Louis arrived in England with an army in May 1216.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to <b>their</b> <b>demands.</b> The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. The species {{is more likely to be}} found inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2011, {{there was}} more {{disruption}} in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Examiner reported that the protests were {{a result of the}} shootings, including that of Oscar Grant. Demonstrations were announced by several activists, which eventually resulted in disruptions to service. The protesters have stated that they did not want their protests to results in closures, and accused the BART police of using the protests as an excuse for disruption. Protesters vowed to continue their protests every Monday until <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> were met.|$|E

5|$|On November 6, {{an angry}} crowd {{surrounded}} the Indiana Statehouse, listed their grievances, demanded the military leave the city, and threatened more violence if <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> were not met. Ralston addressed {{the crowd to}} promise concessions if the workers would return to work. His speech was credited by the press with ending the strike. After three days of peace, the military withdrew from the city. The Indiana General Assembly met later that month and enacted Indiana's first minimum wage laws, regular working hours, workplace safety requirements, and began projects to improve the city's tenement slums.|$|E
5|$|Several Congressmen, {{including}} Hamilton, Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris, {{attempted to}} use this Newburgh conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an impost be established dedicated to {{the sole purpose of}} paying that debt.|$|E
5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 {{were the}} first open revolt against Mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president.

They {{took advantage of the}} lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues. The following year, Texians reiterated <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> at the Convention of 1833.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} Nash equilibria in the Nash demand game. Any x and y such that x + y = z is a Nash equilibrium.

There is also a Nash equilibrium where both players demand the entire good.

5|$|When Congress reconvened in December 1931, the Republicans {{nominally}} {{controlled the}} Senate by the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Charles Curtis, but, as Hoover later wrote, {{there was no}} real majority as Borah and other progressives were against the administration. After the Bonus Army marched on Washington, Borah and Hoover agreed that no action should be taken on <b>their</b> <b>demands</b> so long as the ex-soldiers remained in the capital. Borah considered their presence intimidating to Congress, but was angered when they were forcibly dispersed.|$|E
5|$|By July, {{attempts}} at conciliation had completely collapsed. Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} {{in need of help}} from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of <b>their</b> <b>demands.</b> She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to call a mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|E

This work is based on dynamic grid pricing according to the forecasted price elasticity of demand. The price elasticity of demand is driven by economic benefits, and as a result consumers shift <b>their</b> <b>demand</b> to periods with lower grid prices.|$|R
