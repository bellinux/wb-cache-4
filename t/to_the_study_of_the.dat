His most significant appointment was to the College of Arms as Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary in June 1660. In this position he devoted himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history of the Order of the Garter, which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s, and he proposed a design for the Royal Society's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} {{the equipment and}} procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956. Reines dedicated the major part of his career <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neutrino's properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers to come. This included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{founded the}} Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first {{interdisciplinary}} academic organization {{devoted to the}} study of metals in the United States. He studied the details of faults and grain boundaries in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. In 1961, he moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. He applied the techniques of metallurgy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production methods used to create artefacts such as samurai swords.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work {{even before he}} had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E

5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, {{when compared to other}} facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E

Lastly, Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota, where he received his Ph.D.|$|E
5|$|The Getty Villa {{is one of}} two {{locations}} of the J. Paul Getty Museum.

The collection has 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities dating from 6,500BC to 400AD, including the Lansdowne Heracles and the Victorious Youth. The UCLA/Getty Master’s Program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation is housed on this campus. The collection is documented and presented through the online GettyGuide as well as through audio tours.|$|E
