5|$|In 1989, annual {{timber harvest}} revenue on federal forest land {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting old-growth forest habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for timber harvest. By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's most {{important}} economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely {{of the production}} of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%). Exported services amount <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> exports. The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth.|$|E

Several {{hypotheses}} attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and {{the usefulness of the}} increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.|$|E

The ports support more than 48,000 jobs, including 18,900 direct jobs, and produced $379 million in state and local taxes.|$|E

Reports of strong winds extended as far inland as eastern Tennessee. At Norfolk, Virginia, northeasterly gales on October8 and9 kept steamboats at dock.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Commonwealth formation, there was little {{practical}} difference between the Polish and Lithuanian components; the Lithuanian component formed about a fourth <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the Commonwealth army. The army of the Commonwealth was organized along several different models, with the primary division being that into two 'contingents' or 'enlistments' (or in Polish: autorament): national and foreign. The name applied to types of formation, regulations and the officer cadres; the majority of regular recruits for both came from within the Commonwealth, particularly from the 1630s onward. National units included the towarzysz cavalry (including the Polish hussars and lighter pancerni (Polish) and petyhorcy (Lithuanian) units) and some light cavalry units, with infantry being the distant second in reputation; whereas the foreign units were primarily centered around the infantry and artillery formations, with dragoons gaining prominence from the 1620s, and reiter cavalry soon afterward.|$|E
5|$|Fauna) Notice 2008(2) {{under the}} Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The {{population}} size of Carnaby's cockatoo fell by over 50% in 45 years, and up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> their traditional breeding grounds in the Wheatbelt have been abandoned. The bird {{is part of}} an annual census, the Great Cocky count, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the population change of Carnaby's and other black cockatoos. The 2016 Great Cocky Count counted 10,919 Carnaby's black cockatoos, indicating the population had declined by 50% on the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain since 2010, dropping by around 10% each year. The total population is estimated to consist of 40,000 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the school}} settled in England in 1794 and the Society of Jesus was officially re-established in Britain in 1803. Stonyhurst {{remained}} {{the headquarters of}} the English Province until the middle of the century; by 1851, a third of the Province's Jesuits were based there. Until the 1920s, Jesuit priests were trained on site in what is today the preparatory school. There was a drop in vocations after World War I and the seminary was closed. The number of Jesuits teaching at Stonyhurst fell <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the staff within a decade. Since then, the Jesuit presence has been in decline, but the school continues to place Catholicism and Jesuit philosophy at its core under the guidance of a Jesuit-led chaplaincy team and the involvement of the Jesuits in its governance.|$|E

5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying {{the ability of the}} Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E
