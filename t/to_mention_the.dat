It is also the first episode to feature Kramer making a sliding entrance into Jerry's apartment, which became a trademark in all the later episodes. Carolyn the waitress, played by Anita Wise, and her husband Larry, are named after Seinfeld's own sister and brother-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F.

Pembleton asks for {{time to consider}} it, and the duo ask him not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> offer to Gee. Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the discussion was nothing. After discussing the offer with his wife Mary (Ami Brabson), Pembleton decides {{not to take the}} job and confesses to Gee, who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him sooner. The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which he seldom does.|$|E

Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Federal judges, when {{interpreting}} the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary {{account of the}} intentions of the framers and ratifiers.

5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E

5|$|The exact terms {{by which}} Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The {{existence}} of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> occupation of {{a part of his}} country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> {{millions of}} dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E

5|$|Ailred of Rievaulx, a near-contemporary chronicler, {{recorded}} Edmund's {{marriage to}} {{the daughter of a}} Hungarian king, but omitted <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> name of the king {{and the name of the}} daughter. This could not have been a daughter of King Stephen, although a sister of King Samuel Aba, as well as any other princess of the huge Árpád dynasty is a possible candidate. It is possible that Edmund's wife was named Hedwig. Edmund died shortly after the marriage, possibly during the military campaign of Andrew of Hungary in 1046. The Crowland Psalter records that Edmund died on 10 January, but not the year; he was certainly dead by 1054, when only Edward was recalled to England by the princes' uncle, King Edward the Confessor. The king wanted to appoint his nephew as his heir, however Edward died soon after his arrival in London. With the death of Edward's son, Edgar the Ætheling (who had been proclaimed king in 1066 but was forced to swear allegiance to William the Conqueror and renounce his rights), around 1126, the male line of the House of Wessex died out. Edmund was buried in Hungary, however the exact location of his grave is unknown.|$|E
5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time}} in casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led {{to a loss of}} nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these literary sources, various film scholars have suggested that Méliès was heavily influenced by other works, especially Jacques Offenbach's operetta Le voyage dans la lune (an unauthorized parody of Verne's novels) and the A Trip to the Moon attraction at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The French film historian Thierry Lefebvre hypothesizes that Méliès drew upon both of these works, but in different ways: {{he appears to have}} taken the structure of the film—"a trip to the moon, a moon landing, an encounter with extraterrestrials with a deformity, an underground trek, an interview with the Man in the Moon, and a brutal return to reality back on earth"—directly from the 1901 attraction, but also incorporated many plot elements (including the presence of six astronomers with pseudo-scientific names, telescopes that transform into stools, a moonshot cannon mounted above ground, a scene in which the moon appears to approach the viewer, a lunar snowstorm, an earthrise scene, and umbrella-wielding travelers), not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> parodic tone of the film, from the Offenbach operetta.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the age of fusion–evaporation reactions to produce superheavy elements {{is coming to an end}} due to the increasingly short half-lives to spontaneous fission and the looming proton drip line, so that new techniques such as nuclear transfer reactions (for example, firing uranium nuclei at each other and letting them exchange protons, potentially producing products with around 120 protons) would be required to reach the superactinides. On the other hand, many changes in techniques have been needed to synthesise transuranium elements, from neutron capture (until Z = 100) to light-ion bombardment (until Z = 110) to cold fusion (until Z = 113) and now hot fusion with 48Ca (until Z = 118), not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> essential difference before and after uranium between finding the elements chemically or spectroscopically in nature and synthesising them. In spite of this, the rate of discovery of new elements has remained at one every two and a half years on average for the past two and a half centuries.|$|E

5|$|Jews were {{concentrated}} into ghettos {{in major}} cities {{with the expectation that}} at some point they would be transported further east or even overseas. Horrendous conditions in the ghettos—severe overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a lack of food—resulted in a high death rate. On 15 August 1940, Eichmann released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement to Madagascar of a million Jews per year for four years. When Germany failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the invasion of Britain was postponed indefinitely. As Britain still controlled the Atlantic and her merchant fleet would not be at Germany's disposal for use in evacuations, planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled. Hitler continued <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Plan until February 1942, when the idea was permanently shelved.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since {{it did not matter}} where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed {{the book with}} skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book simply as a romance or fable, due largely to the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Great Wall of China, {{and in particular the}} difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned if he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, if he had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other travelers, and some doubted if he even reached China, or that if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E
