5|$|The Battle of Iwo Jima {{was marked}} {{by some of the}} fiercest {{fighting}} of the Pacific campaign. The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese home islands and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously.

5|$|In 2506, {{during the}} End War, the Daelaam {{under the command}} of Hierarch Artanis came to Cybros to reactivate the purifiers. Clolarion acted as their {{spokesman}} and leader during the mission, and ordered the Purifiers to engage the zerg on the station, and then purified the surface of Endion, the forest moon Cybros orbited. With <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over,</b> Artanis asked the purifiers to join the Daelaam in the war against Amon. Clolarion questioned his sincerity and only accepted an alliance on the condition of Talandar being their ambassador.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Japanese Army {{positions}} on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 kilometers (11mi) of tunnels. The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese Home Islands, and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously.

At first, Éowyn refused his advances, only desiring to go to war to find honour in death. But soon Éowyn realized that she had come to love him in return.|$|E

5|$|The JNA forces around Vukovar were {{reinforced}} by local Serb-manned TO units and Serbian paramilitary volunteers who {{were meant to}} replace those reservists that had {{failed to respond to}} their call-up. The volunteers were often motivated by ethnic hatred, looted countless homes and committed numerous atrocities against Croatian civilians. After more than two months of fighting, the Croatian forces in the city surrendered on 18 November. Vukovar suffered great destruction from JNA artillery and rocket barrages against the town. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>over</b> 700,000 shells and other missiles had been fired at Vukovar at a rate of up to 12,000 a day.|$|E
5|$|The attack caused little direct damage, but in {{the narrow}} waters of the channel the fireships panicked the sailors of the French fleet and most of their ships {{grounded}} and were left immobile. Cochrane expected Gambier to follow his attack with the main fleet, which could then destroy the vulnerable French force, but Gambier refused. Cochrane continued <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> the next several days, successfully destroying several French ships, but with little support from Gambier. This allowed most of the French fleet to refloat and retreat up the Charente to safety. Gambier recalled Cochrane on 14 April and sent him back to Britain, withdrawing most of the inshore squadron at the same time, although scattered fighting continued until 25 April. The increasingly marginalised French fleet was badly damaged and trapped in its home ports; several captains were court-martialed for cowardice and one was shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> the county seat had begun.|$|E

5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around the British 6th Airborne Division's attempts to secure Bénouville Bridge (later renamed Pegasus Bridge, in honour of <b>the</b> <b>battle)</b> <b>over</b> the Caen Canal during the Normandy landings on 5 June 1944. The player is able to command either the British or German side in the game. Regardless of the side chosen, British units will not appear on the map {{at the beginning of}} the game as the British 6th Airborne Division have not yet made their parachute drops. German forces are distributed around the four far corners of the map, with a few units positioned near Bénouville Bridge. If playing as the British, the objective is to defeat all German forces and secure all bridges in the area, with the capture or destruction of the Merville Battery being the ultimate goal. If playing as the Germans, the only objective is to hold off all British attacks for 18 hours, which is the equivalent to 36 in-game turns.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary <b>The</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>Over</b> Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E
5|$|By the Battle of Chaffin's Farm on September 29, 1864, Beaty {{had risen}} {{to the rank of}} first {{sergeant}} in Company G. His regiment was among a division of black troops assigned to attack the center of the Confederate defenses at New Market Heights. The defenses consisted of two lines of abatis and one line of palisades manned by Brigadier General John Gregg's Texas Brigade. The attack was met with intense Confederate fire and was turned back after reaching a line of abatis. During the retreat, Company G's color bearer was killed; Beaty returned through about 600 yards of enemy fire to retrieve the flag and return it to the company lines. The regiment had suffered severe casualties in the failed charge. Of Company G's eight officers and eighty-three enlisted men who entered the battle, only sixteen enlisted men, including Beaty, survived the attack unwounded. With no officers remaining, Beaty took command of the company and led it through a second charge at the Confederate lines. The second attack successfully drove the Confederates from their fortified positions, at the cost of three more men from Company G. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>over</b> fifty percent of the black division had been killed, captured, or wounded. For his actions, Beaty was commended on the battlefield by General Benjamin Butler and seven months later, on April 6, 1865, awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
