25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E

[...] All of us, whether guilty or not, whether young or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by the consequences and liable for it. [...] We Germans must look truth straight in the eye – without embellishment and without distortion. [...] There can be no reconciliation without remembrance." ...|$|E

500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth.

It has been said, that Debs was what every socialist and radical should be; fierce in his convictions, but kind and compassionate in his personal relations. As Heywood Broun noted in his eulogy for Debs, quoting a fellow Socialist: [...] "That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> brotherhood of man. And that's not the funniest part of it. As long as he's around I believe it myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, the coherentist {{approach}} to science, {{in which a}} theory is validated if it makes sense of observations {{as part of a}} coherent whole, became prominent due to W. V. Quine and others. Some thinkers such as Stephen Jay Gould seek to ground science in axiomatic assumptions, such as the uniformity of nature. A vocal minority of philosophers, and Paul Feyerabend (1924–1994) in particular, argue {{that there is no such}} <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] "scientific method", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly supernatural ones. Another {{approach to}} thinking about science involves studying how knowledge is created from a sociological perspective, an approach represented by scholars like David Bloor and Barry Barnes. Finally, a tradition in continental philosophy approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.|$|E

500|$|As the {{difference}} between the two prices or quantities increases, the accuracy of the PED given by the formula above decreases for a combination of two reasons. [...] First, the PED for a good is not necessarily constant; as explained below, PED can vary at different points along the demand curve, due to its percentage nature. Elasticity is not the same <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> slope of the demand curve, which is dependent on the units used for both price and quantity. [...] Second, percentage changes are not symmetric; instead, the percentage change between any two values depends on which one is chosen as the starting value and which as the ending value. For example, if quantity demanded increases from 10 units to 15 units, the percentage change is 50%, i.e., (15 − 10) ÷ 10 (converted to a percentage). [...] But if quantity demanded decreases from 15 units to 10 units, the percentage change is −33.3%, i.e., (10 − 15)÷15.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{concepts}} of most DKP systems are simple. [...] Players are given points {{for participating in}} raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss 'drops' the item.

[...] These points, while earned and spent like currency, are not the same <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world. [...] The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players. [...] Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband, those points become valueless. [...] These measures vary considerably in usage. [...] Some guilds eschew formalized 'loot' systems completely, allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses. [...] Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding. [...] A few common variations are described below.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Joshua Safran {{initially}} {{wanted a}} [...] "straightforward action show" [...] {{different from his}} past work, which included the soapy dramas Gossip Girl and Smash. He revealed {{that he wanted to}} do something with a law enforcement theme such as a political thriller about the NYPD after the September 11 attacks. He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." [...] He called the series a sexy romance and a political thriller, adding [...] "It's like, what would Die Hard be if Die Hard was weekly and was also a soap".|$|E

500|$|While Michael Cerveris has {{appeared}} as the Observer {{in the three}} previous episodes—and {{has appeared}} in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was [...] "one of several nuggets dropped in" [...] by J.J. Abrams {{in a manner similar}} to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was [...] "this sort of Where's Waldo <b>thing</b> (<b>as)</b> <b>the</b> linchpin in an overarching story of the series". He continued: Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show than we ever expected." [...] The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, [...] "I've got a little too much else going on, and who knows if they would ever grow back. I have little enough hair as it is." [...] "The Arrival" [...] was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{psychiatrist}} {{became a}} scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels. He is feared, is not confided, is not taken into {{confidence in the}} secrets of one's soul and is asked to provide only medications. Psychiatric labels, or stigmas, have spread so widely {{that there is no}} such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> media that does not call a disliked person schizo and does not generalize psychiatric assessments to phenomena of public life. The word psikhushka entered everyday vocabulary. All persons who deviate from the usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill, with an approving giggling of public. Not surprisingly, during such a stigmatization, people with real mental disorders fear publicity like the plague. Vilnius psychologist Oleg Lapin has the same point that politicians and the press attach psychological, psychiatric and medical labels; he adds that psychiatry has acquired the new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion. Formerly, one could say: you are going against God or God is with us; now one can say: I behave reasonably, adequately, and you do not behave in that way. In 2007, Alexander Dugin, a professor at the Moscow State University and adviser to State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin, presented opponents of Vladimir Putin's policy as mentally ill by saying, [...] "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination." [...] In The Moscow Regional Psychiatric Newspaper of 2012, psychiatrist Dilya Enikeyeva in violation of medical privacy and ethics publicized the diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder, which she in absentia gave Kseniya Sobchak, a Russian TV anchor and a member of political opposition, and stated that Sobchak was harmful to society.|$|E
