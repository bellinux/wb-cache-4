5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, from an observer's {{point of view}} its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> an electron can approach, but never reach, <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light.|$|E

The experiment demonstrates that, for an inertial frame K' in motion relative to an inertial frame K where <b>the</b> one-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light is isotropic, even the special theory of relativity renders <b>the</b> one-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light as function of the velocity of K' {{in agreement with the}} Tangherlini transformations. However, <b>the</b> two-way <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light remains constant for all inertial frames, in agreement with the two-way experimental techniques.

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If {{the dimensions of the}} resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light.|$|E
5|$|Between 1877 and 1931, Albert A. Michelson made {{multiple}} {{measurements of}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. His 1877–79 measurements were performed {{under the auspices}} of Simon Newcomb, who was also working on measuring <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. Michelson's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault's original arrangement. As seen in Figure5, Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L (i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light). If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus, the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M (equal in diameter to lens L) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens, this being true regardless of the RM distance. Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000feet. To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance, Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens (150feet) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15feet closer to L than the principal focus. This allowed an RS distance of between 28.5 to 33.3feet. He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air-turbine-powered mirror R, and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115mm. His 1879 figure for <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, 299944±51km/s, was within about 0.05% of the modern value. His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements {{such as the use of}} polygonal prism-shaped rotating mirrors (enabling a brighter image) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts-per-million accuracy. His figure of 299,796±4km/s was only about 4km/s higher than the current accepted value. Michelson's final 1931 attempt to measure <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in vacuum was interrupted by his death. Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F.G.Pease and F.Pearson, various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy, including an earthquake which disturbed the baseline measurement.|$|E

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time.
