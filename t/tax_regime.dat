40|$|An {{important}} source of concern about corporation <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> within the European Union {{is the extent to}} which differences in regimes between member states generate production inefficiency. This paper analyzes the <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> in the 15 EU member states. It identifies the extent to which they differ by presenting two summary measures: the cost of capital and the effective average tax rate. It also identifies how these measures would be affected by alternative forms of harmonization within the EU, such as a common corporation tax rate or tax base. Such simulations serve a dual purpose. They identify the impact of potential policies, but, more generally, they show how differences in effective levels of taxation between countries depend on specific aspects of the <b>tax</b> <b>regimes...</b>|$|R

The benefits of operating in the special economic zones include tax allowances, exemption from asset and land taxes and protection against changes in the <b>tax</b> <b>regime.</b> Some regions also provide extensive support for large investors (over $100million.)

Arabian and Persian inspired architecture is part of the expression of the local Emirati identity. Persian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture and folk arts. For example, the distinctive wind tower which tops traditional Emirati buildings, the barjeel has become an identifying mark of Emirati architecture and is attributed to Persian influence. This influence is derived both from traders who fled the <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> in Persia in the early 19th Century and from Emirati ownership of ports on the Persian coast, for instance the Al Qassimi port of Lingeh.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in <b>tax</b> <b>regime.</b> Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E
25|$|During the 1998 {{election}} campaign, {{the leader}} of the Australian Democrats, Meg Lees, stated that her party was opposed to a GST unless food, books and tourism packages sold offshore were exempt, and other compensating tax measures were implemented. The government initially stated that exemptions to the GST were not possible, and looked most likely to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Brian Harradine. However a compromise was eventually reached with Lees, involving most basic food items being exempt from the GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the ACCC to oversee the implementation of the new <b>tax</b> <b>regime.</b> A proposal to exempt tampons from the GST was dismissed by Howard.

25|$|In the 1990s, President Fujimori {{implemented}} several {{market reforms}} that {{allowed for the}} growth of Peru's mineral sector. In 1995, the Fujimori government passed a land law (Law 26505) that granted mining corporations the right to use land for their operations in exchange for monetary compensation to the landowners. In addition, the Fujimori administration installed a new <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> that exempted mining corporations from taxation and paying royalties until they regained their initial investments. Fujimori also spearheaded other reforms that removed restrictions on profit/capital remittances, eliminated performance requirements for foreign investments, reduced tariffs on imports and removed tariffs on exports, established simpler licensing procedures, modified policies regarding indigenous land tenure, lowered taxes, liberalized capital market, and privatized state firms and financial institutions. These changes facilitated a dramatic increase in new foreign direct investment (FDI) and allowed entry into the global market. In the period from 1990 to 1998, Peru's exports increased by over 85 percent. Out of this, the mineral industry accounts for 50 percent of Peru's total exports and has {{played a major role in}} its national economic growth.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada avoided {{charging}} {{an income}} tax prior to the First World War. The lack of income tax {{was seen as a}} key component in Canada's efforts to attract immigrants as Canada offered a lower <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> compared to almost every other country. Prior to the war, Canadian federal governments relied on tariffs and customs income {{under the auspices of the}} National Policy for most of their revenue, while the provincial governments sustained themselves primarily through their management of natural resources (the Prairie provinces being paid subsidies by the federal government as Ottawa retained control of their natural resources for the time being). The federal Liberal Party considered the probable need to introduce {{an income tax}} should their negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States in the early 20th century succeed, but the Conservatives defeated the Liberals in 1911 over their support of free trade. The Conservatives (Tories) opposed income tax as they wanted to attract immigrants primarily from the United Kingdom and the United States, and they wanted to give immigrants some incentive to come to Canada.|$|E
25|$|The firm helped {{multinational}} companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving {{plans will be}} seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities.

Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If you want to change the Lux <b>tax</b> <b>regime,</b> the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E

2500|$|Danes enjoy a high {{standard}} of living and the Danish economy is characterised by extensive government welfare provisions. Like other Nordic countries, Denmark has adopted the Nordic Model, which combines free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and strong worker protection. As {{a result of its}} acclaimed [...] "flexicurity" [...] model, Denmark has the most free labour market in Europe, according to the World Bank. Employers can hire and fire whenever they want (flexibility), and between jobs, unemployment compensation is very high (security). Establishing a business can be done {{in a matter of hours}} and at very low costs. No restrictions apply regarding overtime work, which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Denmark has a competitive corporate tax rate of 24.5% and a special time-limited <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> for expatriates. The Danish taxation system is broad based, with a 25% value-added tax, in addition to excise taxes, income taxes and other fees. The overall level of taxation (sum of all taxes, as a percentage of GDP) is estimated to be 46% in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Albertans are the lowest-taxed {{people in}} Canada, {{mostly because of}} the province's {{considerable}} oil and gas income {{as well as the}} more conservative financial philosophies of successive governments. [...] It is also the only province in Canada where there is no provincial sales tax. Unlike the other provinces, which use a progressive income <b>tax</b> <b>regime,</b> Alberta used a flat rate income tax (currently at 10%), while equal for all, it also puts a higher burden of taxes on the lower-classes versus the upper-classes than found elsewhere. As a campaign promise, the New Democratic Party implemented a progressive system in 2015 after their electoral success. Alberta is one of few provinces that consistently has not received equalization payments from the federal government since 1962 (the others being British Columbia and (until 2008) Ontario, the original benchmark provinces). Alberta is now the largest net contributor to the program, which is intended to ensure that all provinces are able to provide similar levels of public services. [...] The province's wealth is largely due to the abundance of natural resources, and the provincial government's generous policies toward oil and wood pulp companies, etc. that have harvested the natural resources for export markets at a very high rate. As a result, Alberta is the only province in Canada that has (recently) eliminated its provincial debt.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011 CBA instituted {{major changes}} to the luxury <b>tax</b> <b>regime.</b> The {{previous}} CBA had a dollar-for-dollar tax provision system, which remained in effect through the 2012–13 season. Teams exceeding the tax level were punished by being forced to pay one dollar to the league for each dollar by which their payroll exceeded the tax level. Starting in 2013–14, the tax changed to an incremental system. Under the current system, tax is assessed at different levels based on the amount that a team is over the luxury tax threshold. The scheme is not cumulative—each level of tax applies only to amounts over that level's threshold. For example, {{a team that is}} $8 million over the tax threshold will pay $1.50 for each of its first $5 million over the tax threshold, and $1.75 per dollar for the remaining $3 million. Starting in 2014–15, [...] "repeat offenders", subject to additional penalties, are defined as teams that paid tax in previous seasons. In the first season, repeat offenders from in all previous three seasons will pay a stiffer tax rate; from 2015–16 thereafter, teams paying taxes in three out of four years will be subject to the higher repeater rate. As in the previous CBA, the tax revenue is divided among teams with lower payrolls. However, under the new scheme, no more than 50% of the total tax revenue can go exclusively to teams that did not go over the cap. Initial reports did not specify the use of the remaining 50% under the 2011 CBA, but it was later confirmed that this amount would be used to fund revenue sharing for the season during which tax was paid.|$|E

40|$|Growth-inequality {{relationship}} is reexamined in a neo-classical growth model with discrete occupational choice and incomplete markets for human capital. In our model a fiscal redistributive tax program directly impacts the steady state distribution of human capital by influencing the occupational {{choice of the}} agents. Growth and incomeinequality are endogenously driven by {{the evolution of the}} proportion of innovators in the economy and the redistributive tax rate. The correlation between growth and factor shares depends crucially on the interaction between the redistributive tax policy and the initial distribution of human capital. The model predicts that the growth rate and incomeinequality are positively related across countries with different redistributive <b>tax</b> <b>regimes.</b> On the other hand, countries with different redistributive <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> as well as different initial distribution of human capital do not show any robust correlation between growth and inequality. The correlation depends on the skill intensity of the production technology and the degree of institutional barriers to knowledge diffusion. The lesson for the cross-country growth-inequality regression is {{that it is necessary to}} adequately control for the differences in initial distribution of human capital, and technology, as well as differences in redistributive <b>tax</b> <b>regimes...</b>|$|R
