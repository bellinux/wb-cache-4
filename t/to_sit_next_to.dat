5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray {{in place of the}} motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Millennium Monument was {{the starting point of}} the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once “commanding presence” that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a “classical” take on the original, incorporating a fountain {{at the base of the}} limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.|$|E

He became infatuated with Langtry, and she soon became his de facto mistress. She was presented to the Prince's mother, Queen Victoria. Princess Alexandra was generous in never displaying any jealousy about her husband's infidelities and accepted and acknowledged Lillie.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle's {{policy was}} to {{postpone}} elections {{as long as}} 2.6 million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers. In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position. Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected {{that only a few}} months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal Pétain when he was serving the Vichy regime. Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in Marseille and Lyon he became irate when he had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the Maquisard parades which preceded his speech. When he reached Toulouse, de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.|$|E
500|$|In September 1972, Vulović {{expressed}} {{willingness to}} resume {{working as a}} flight attendant. The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. Vulović was celebrated as a national hero and decorated by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. The Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song in her honour, titled Vesna stjuardesa ("Vesna the Stewardess"). She continued to fly regularly and stated that fellow passengers were surprised to see her on flights.

Later, on his deathbed in 1797, Burke would have his wife turn Fox away rather than allow a final reconciliation.|$|R

50|$|The {{redevelopment}} of Water House and {{was designed}} by architects and exhibition designers Pringle Richards Sharratt. A new wing, designed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> comfortably <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the early Georgian architecture of William Morris's house, succeeds in doing so by using similar details - handmade brick with sash windows and gauged brick arches - in a contrasting red brick. The new space houses a new gallery space for temporary exhibitions, toilets and a café with a balcony overlooking the gardens to the rear. The permanent displays and educational areas were completely rearranged, and the project also provides a learning and research centre on the top floor, offices in the basement. New learning programmes and a dedicated website were developed alongside the physical changes.|$|R

This {{was the first}} episode that Sugar and Sanchez worked on together; Sugar's previous partner Adam Muto served as the episode's creative director, and also helped clean up the episode's storyboards. Sugar was excited {{to get a chance}} to show how Flame Princess interacted in the Land of Ooo, because in [...] "Incendium", she was only shown inside of her lantern. The line about Finn wanting to play BMO with Flame Princess was based on Sanchez's experiences with his high school girlfriend; he reasoned that, since Finn was younger, his ultimate idea of love would be <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> his love interest and play video games.|$|E

[...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote.

Burt tells Kurt that he must join a school team within a week, or face punishment. Although Burt had meant a sports team, when Kurt enthusiastically tells Burt that he has join the glee club, he accepts this as an adequate substitute in part due to its competitive aspect. In the show's final episode, [...] "Dreams Come True", Burt and Carole attend the rededication ceremony of the McKinley High auditorium in the year 2020, when it is renamed the [...] "Finn Hudson Memorial Auditorium".
