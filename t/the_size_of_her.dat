5|$|At age sixteen, Stone began {{teaching}} in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was {{much lower than}} that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her “only a woman’s pay.” Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: “To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask.” Although Stone’s salary increased along with <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was half <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fellow speakers {{and she wore}} huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise {{to those of us}} who'd heard her speak.|$|E

25|$|Lord Belmore bought James Madison on 16 June 1813 {{and had her}} {{converted}} from schooner to brig rig. He also renamed her Osprey, with home port of Killybegs in Donegal. Later, Belmore had her armed; her warrant as a letter of marque against the United States named Richard Chambers as master and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew as 30 men. However, it bore the date 27 August 1814, which ex post was quite late in the war. There is no sign in either the London Gazette or Lloyd's List of Osprey taking any prizes.|$|E

[...] As an in-joke to Smith's reaction to when he first heard the track, the song starts with the manager saying [...] "Time release the fresh", Furtado laughing at the phrase, and Interscope Records A representative Thom Panunzio replying “You’re 100 percent right Chris.” The title and intro, during which Furtado chants [...] "the bigger the better" [...] against a bass line, references the character finding strength in <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> earrings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{model is}} {{proposed}} to study optimal trading strategies in a limit order book, as typically arise when a trader has {{a block of}} shares to liquidate and she submits limit orders. The execution of limit orders is uncertain, {{which leads to a}} stochastic control problem. In contrast to previous literature, we allow the trader to choose both the quotes and <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> submitted orders. Great attention is paid to how the trading strategy is affected by an order book’s characteristics, market volatility and the trader’s risk attitude. We prescribe an optimal splitting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>size,</b> which is new in the literature on optimal trade execution where this problem is solved only in the case of market orders, {{and at the same time}} we offer guidelines to optimally place orders further behind the best price or to (re) position them more aggressively. Thus this paper is the first attempt towards a more realistic modeling of optimal liquidation throughout limit orders...|$|R
500|$|For the {{localization}} of the game, {{the team}} {{decided to give}} the character of Drippy a Welsh accent, citing comedian Rhod Gilbert as a reference point. Steffan Rhodri was ultimately cast as Drippy; the team immediately felt that he fit the role, during his first audition. The Fairy Godmother character was initially conceived as an [...] "older lady with a perm", which evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "mountain-like woman". The method that she uses to give birth, in which the offspring burst forth, was inspired by the process that sea anemones lay eggs. The character of Cassiopeia was conceived in a quick meeting, after which the background information and story documents were handed to Momose, who drew the character based on the information. Cassiopeia underwent various changes throughout development. In particular, Momose suggested possible alterations to her physical appearance, such as <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, and changing colors to reflect her emotions. The character Pea was named as a reference to the fairy tale The Princess and the Pea, while her Japanese name of Kokoru is a reference to the word [...]|$|E
500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
500|$|At a basic level, {{the entries}} in Harris's List detail each woman's age, her {{physical}} appearance (including <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breasts), her sexual specialities, {{and sometimes a}} description of her genitals. [...] Additional information such as how long she had been active as a prostitute, or if she sang, danced or conversed well, is also included. [...] Addresses and prices, which range from five shillings to five pounds, are provided. [...] The types of prostitute the lists present vary from [...] "low-born errant drabs", to prominent courtesans like Kitty Fisher and Fanny Murray; later editions contain only [...] "genteel mannered prostitutes worthy of praise". [...] The charms of a Mrs Dodd, who lived at number six Hind Court in Fleet Street, were listed in 1788 as [...] "reared on two pillars of monumental alabaster", continuing: [...] "the symmetry of its parts, its borders enriched with wavering tendrils, its ruby portals, and the tufted grove, that crowns {{the summit of the}} mount, all join to invite the guest to enter." [...] In the same edition, a similarly lurid description precedes the latter part of Miss Davenport's entry, which concludes: [...] "Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is tall, and so well proportioned (when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you to do, if you perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest) that she might be taken for a fourth Grace, or a breathing animated Venus de Medicis... she has a keeper (a Mr. Hannah) both kind and liberal; notwithstanding which, she has no objection to two supernumerary guineas." [...] Miss Clicamp, of number two York Street near Middlesex Hospital, is described as [...] "one of the finest, fattest figures as fully finished for fun and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed... fortunate for the true lovers of fat, should fate throw them into the possession of such full grown beauties." [...] More characteristic of Harris's List though, is the 1764 entry for Miss Wilmot, which tells of an amorous encounter with King George III's brother, the Duke of York: ...|$|E

500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive". According to IGN, [...] "at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled {{to the brim with}} dagger-like teeth." [...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her on the list of [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because everything about her is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due to her face despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head." [...] Playboy included Mileena, Kitana, and Jade together in their list of [...] "the hottest video game breasts of all time" [...] at 19th place.|$|E
