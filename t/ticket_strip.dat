50|$|Strippenkaarten {{were sold}} by tobacconists, supermarkets, tourist offices and public {{transport}} companies. Only the smaller denomination tickets (up to 8 strips) were available on board, hence the small difference in price between 8 and 15 <b>strip</b> <b>tickets,</b> to encourage pre-purchasing which speeds up boarding times.|$|R

50|$|Paper <b>tickets</b> (with {{magnetic}} <b>strips)</b> must be {{validated by}} inserting {{them into a}} machine whereby a date and time is punched onto the <b>strip.</b> Some <b>tickets</b> have limited validity thereafter, so that a journey must be completed within a certain time after validation. Navigo passes are contactless smart cards and are validated by presenting them near to an RFID reader. Fines are issued for those travelling without a valid ticket.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} century the first discussions and {{investigations}} started to introduce a standard payment scheme for all modes of public transport. When the plans for the -then- new platform the Luas became reality the demand for one single ticketing scheme became more and more important and it was the intention and goal to introduce the new scheme together with the opening of the new Luas line. The Leap card scheme, final result of this lengthy process, uses a smartcard which is usable in all Dublin public transport systems.The RPA was respobsible for drawing up an integrated ticketing scheme, and the project was victim of many set-backs: many times exceeding the budgets, not delivering on date etc. The RPA was also responsible for the development of the Luas smart-card which is not compatible with the new Leap card which was delivered in December 2011.Though integrated ticketing, of a form, existed in Dublin prior to the LEAP card, in the form of dual or triple service paper magnetic <b>strip</b> <b>tickets,</b> these were not the basis for the interconnected ticketing system. In fact many argue that LEAP is a smart card, but not integrated ticketing. For example, there are magnetic <b>strip</b> <b>ticket</b> options that allow one unlimited travel on all three Dublin public transport services, and inter-city tickets that allow a person taking an intercity journey to also ride Dublin Bus or Luas into the city centre from regional rail stations if they wish, as part of their ticket price.LEAP is not fully integrated. While it can be used across all three services, there is no single zonal system for all Dublin public transport and one cannot start a journey on a Bus and finish on a Luas, for example. There are also some oddities with the ticketing system. For example, a magnetic <b>strip</b> <b>ticket</b> in the form of a Daily Rambler for DART and Bus is €13.10, however the daily cap for the LEAP card means that one can have a de facto unlimited daily rambler on all services including Luas for just €10. Once this cap is reached, the card will not deduct further credit.|$|R
5000|$|Break Opens, {{also known}} as breakopens, break open cards, <b>strip</b> <b>tickets,</b> nevada tickets or in some Bingo Halls as [...] "pickles" [...] are lottery or bingo cards on which there are {{concealed}} letters, numbers, or symbols that have been predetermined as winners. The cards are often made of cardboard and contain perforated cover window tabs, behind which the combinations are printed. The purchaser must [...] "break open" [...] the card, or pull up the pull-tabs, to see the information printed within, and then must confirm with winning combinations printed {{on the back of}} the card, various cards may have come from the printer highlighted as winning under the tabs. The winning combination will be highlighted, making the identification of winning tickets easier.|$|R
500|$|The line {{operated}} from 5:30am to 12:30am on weekdays (including Saturdays), and 7:30am to 12noon on Sundays. The standard one-way fare following the line's opening was 2d. ("workmen's tickets" [...] at 2d. return were available up to 7:58am) {{and a book}} of 25 tickets was available at 4s. However, the original flat fares were abandoned in July 1906 and replaced with graded fares of between 1d. and 3d. In November 1906, season tickets were introduced along with through tickets with the District Railway (interchanging at Charing Cross). It was not until December 1907 {{that it was possible}} to buy a through ticket onto the Central London Railway (via Oxford Circus). The BS abolished its season tickets in October 1908 and replaced them with <b>strip</b> <b>tickets,</b> sold in sets of six, that could be used on the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Hampstead tubes.|$|R
