50|$|There are {{two types}} of radar {{approach}}es: Precision (PAR) and Surveillance (ASR).A radar approach may be given to any aircraft upon request and may be offered to pilots of aircraft in distress or to expedite traffic; however, an ASR might not be approved unless there is an ATC operational requirement, or in an unusual situation or emergency. Acceptance of a PAR or ASR by a pilot does not waive the prescribed weather minimums for the airport or for the particular aircraft operator concerned. The decision to make a radar approach when the reported weather is below the established minimums rests with the pilot. PAR and ASR minimums are published on separate pages in the FAA's <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures</b> publication.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{airports}} with CAT III {{approaches have}} listings for CAT IIIa and IIIb or just CAT III {{on the instrument}} approach plate (U.S. <b>Terminal</b> <b>Procedures).</b> CAT IIIb RVR minimums are limited by the runway/taxiway lighting and support facilities, and {{are consistent with the}} airport Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS) plan. Operations below 600 ft RVR require taxiway centerline lights and taxiway red stop bar lights. If the CAT IIIb RVR minimums on a runway end are 600 ft, which is a common figure in the U.S., ILS approaches to that runway end with RVR below 600 ft qualify as CAT IIIc and require special taxi procedures, lighting, and approval conditions to permit the landings. FAA Order 8400.13D limits CAT III to 300 ft RVR or better. Order 8400.13D (2009) allows special authorization CAT II approaches to runways without ALSF-2 approach lights and/or touchdown zone/centerline lights, which has expanded the number of potential CAT II runways.|$|E

50|$|Intersections {{also play}} an {{important}} role in departure and approach procedures. All intersections have an alphabetical or alphanumeric designation. Near major airports, the intersection designation code typically consists of three letters followed by the runway number. Most other intersection designations consist of five-letter combinations that are either pronounceable or chosen for their mnemonic value, since either air traffic control or the flight plan may require the pilot to announce the designation. In the <b>terminal</b> <b>procedure</b> or approach plate example to the right, note that two of the intersections are called DONUT and KOFFE. Many intersections are named because of local points of interest. In the case of Carrollton County Airport, there is a popular diner located on the field to which many pilots fly.|$|R

The overall goal of the project is to provide an innovative system to monitor rotorcraft noise in flight, in view of performing optimized low-noise <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures.</b> To achieve this goal it is necessary to estimate in real time the main rotor tip-path plane (TPP) orientation with respect to the vehicle airspeed vector, which in turn depends on the TPP orientation with respect to the helicopter airframe. An in-flight contactless measuring system, capable of measuring the three angles of a helicopter blade with respect to the hub, is proposed and validated.

Operational planning includes both strategies of planning and resource management. As planning procedures are not (yet) fully automated, a skilled workforce of planners is needed to conduct the complex operational planning of container <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures</b> and equipment. By using a simulation game, we explored which planning strategies are successful, leading to efficient and effective use of container terminal equipment. Our results show that through the game, {{we were able to}} identify three main strategies, of which one is associated with efficient unloading of vessels, and with high scores in game play. A second type of strategy, moderately rewarded, is associated with good handling of containers. The third type of strategies generally reflects players overwhelmed by increases in activity in the port, resulting in long wait times and a poor score at the game. </p...|$|E
40|$|The present {{contribution}} aims at {{providing a}} comprehensive illustration {{of a new}} approach to rotorcraft noise abatement, especially during <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures,</b> when the vehicle approaches the ground and the acoustic impact is higher. This approach pursues the development of technologies and tools for real-time, in-flight monitoring of the emitted noise. The effect of the acoustic radiation is presented to the pilot in a condensed, practical form on a new cockpit instrumentation, the Pilot Acoustic Indicator (PAI), to be used for performing quieter maneuvers. The PAI is based on the synergetic composition of pre-calculated acoustic data, which are used in a noise estimation algorithm together with the data gathered by an innovative contactless measurement system, capable of acquiring the main rotor blade motion. The paper reports on the current studies in unsteady and quasi-steady aeroacoustic prediction and tip-path-plane angle of attack and thrust coefficient observation. Results on novel methodologies are discussed, together with the main features of the PAI design and development process...|$|E

40|$|Rats {{are used}} widely in ischemia–reperfusion and other heart experiments, but current {{protocols}} for thoracotomy have serious shortcomings. Median sternotomy causes bleeding from sternum {{itself and the}} internal thoracic arteries, whereas left thoracotomy requires exteriorization {{of the heart and}} its reintroduction after completion of the procedure and often is complicated by traction or torsion of the cardiopulmonary bundle and atelectasis in the left lung. Here we describe a new, <b>terminal</b> <b>procedure</b> that minimizes blood loss and allows wide access to the heart without disturbing its anatomic position. Transverse thoracotomy, preferably through the fifth intercostal space, is performed after double ligature of both internal thoracic arteries 1 intercostal space above and 1 below the incision. Blood loss is minimal and occurs mainly with dissection of deep pectoral muscles and intercostal muscles, and the animal is better ventilated than with conventional protocols. We believe that our procedure is superior to existing techniques because it minimizes blood loss during intervention, does not disturb the anatomic position of the heart, and allows wide access to the organ for experimental manipulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} 2 methods of semen collection that could be used as <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures</b> in stallions with irreparable conditions, such as fractures or colic. Electroejaculation was attempted under general anesthesia. Forty-eight hours later, the ponies were castrated and 2 different epididymal sperm collection techniques were attempted by using a flushing or floating method. Additionally, the effect of supplemental seminal plasma was evaluated. Experimentally, electroejaculation was found to be a safe but ineffective method of terminal semen collection. Viable sperm cells were successfully recovered with both types of epididymal collection. The flotation method was least cumbersome and showed a tendency to be superior to flushing in terms of sperm motility and percentage of cells passing through glass wool/sephadex filtration, although differences did not reach significance. The addition of seminal plasma to epididymal spermatozoa prior to cryopreservation was of no value. In conclusion, either method of epididymal sperm collection is an acceptable method of terminal semen collection...|$|E
40|$|To prepare {{students}} {{in just four}} years to enter veterinary practice, veterinary medical educators offer an array of laboratory and clinical experiences coordinated with didactic instruction. Recent curricular changes have reduced the numbers of animals involved in painful or <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures.</b> For each use of animals, veterinary educators are required by the USDA's policies 11 and 12 to complete animal-use protocols that include questions on alternatives to procedures causing more than momentary pain or distress. Veterinary medical educators seeking improved teaching resources and methods or completing animal-use protocols may find it frustrating to locate the relevant information, which is dispersed across many databases. This paper addresses a gap facing veterinary educators by presenting user-friendly searching tools that are targeted toward (a) locating teaching resources and (b) conducting effective bibliographic searches on standard teaching laboratory procedures, as required for animal-use protocols. These tools simplify searching by providing streamlined access to the resources being sought. Facilitating efficient and effective searching by users can improve teaching and simplify compliance with USDA requirements...|$|E
40|$|The liver {{stages of}} Plasmodium parasites are {{important}} {{targets for the}} development of anti-malarial vaccine candidates and chemoprophylaxis approaches that aim to prevent clinical infection. Analyzing the impact of interventions on liver stages in the murine malaria model system Plasmodium yoelii has been cumbersome and requires <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures.</b> In vivo imaging of bioluminescent parasites has previously been shown to be an effective and non-invasive alternative to monitoring liver stage burden in the Plasmodium berghei model. Here we report the generation and characterization of a transgenic P. yoelii parasite expressing the reporter protein luciferase throughout the parasite life cycle. In vivo bioluminescent imaging of these parasites allows for quantitative analysis of P. yoelii liver stage burden and parasite development, which is comparable to quantitative RT-PCR analysis of liver infection. Using this system, we show that both BALB/cJ and C 57 BL/ 6 mice show comparable susceptibility to P. yoelii infection with sporozoites and that bioluminescent imaging can be used to monitor protective efficacy of attenuated parasite immunizations. Thus, this rapid, simple and noninvasive method for monitoring P. yoelii infection in the liver provides an efficient system to screen and evaluate th...|$|E

40|$|AbstractVisual {{assessment}} of surfaces {{may not be}} enough to document the level of cleanliness in the hospital setting.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy of hospital <b>terminal</b> cleaning <b>procedures,</b> using an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence method in a teaching hospital. MethodDuring 2008 we conducted an evaluation using ATP bioluminescence LIGHTNING MVP™ (Arquimed) of external and internal housekeeping service. After conducting an initial evaluation we implemented education of cleaning practices and finally we did a post intervention evaluation. Using chi-square method we compared prior versus after cleaning, quality of cleaning performed by external versus internal personnel, single versus double <b>terminal</b> cleaning <b>procedures</b> and prior versus after intervention. A finding of three RLU or less was considered a clean surface. ResultsWe performed 198 evaluations in 33 patient units and nine OR. Internal personnel accomplished 25. 37 % of clean surfaces before and 80 % after the education intervention (p= 0. 01). In contrast, external personnel obtained 68. 8 % before and 73. 33 % after intervention (p= 0. 3).

40|$|Urethane is {{a common}} and often {{preferred}} anesthetic agent for urodynamic recordings in rats, but its use is often restricted to <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures</b> because of a prolonged duration of action and potentially toxic effects. When urodynamic recordings are part of survival procedures in rodent experimental models, inhalation anesthetics, such as isoflurane, are frequently used and generally well tolerated. In this study, we compared the effects of urethane and isoflurane on lower urinary tract function. For this purpose, adult female rats were anesthetized by subcutaneous administration of urethane (n = 6) or by inhalation of isoflurane (n = 5). Micturition reflexes were assessed by concurrent cystometrogram and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) recordings to determine bladder contractile properties, EUS activation patterns, and the coordination between bladder contractions and EUS activation. Compared with urethane, isoflurane reduced frequency of bursts, firing frequency, and amplitude of EUS EMG activity during voiding {{as well as the}} EUS EMG amplitude during the bladder filling phase. Isoflurane also prolonged the bladder intercontractile intervals. Other several key functional aspects of the bladder contractile properties as well as the coordination between bladder contractions were not different between the two experimental groups. We conclude that micturition reflexes were differentially affected by isoflurane and urethane. Specifically, isoflurane exhibited a significant suppression of the EUS EMG activity and prolonged the bladder intercontractile intervals compared with urethane. We suggest that these anesthetic properties be taken into consideration during the experimental design and interpretation of urodynamic recordings in rodent models...|$|E
40|$|Echocardiography is a reliable, valid, {{and safe}} method for the {{examination}} of cardiac structure and function in both humans and animals. It has become an invaluable tool for serial meas-ures of cardiac structure and function in research using animal models {{due to the fact}} that echocardiography potentially can replace highly invasive or <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures.</b> As a result, the implementation of echocardiography in research using labora-tory animals has increased steadily. Over the past century, laboratory rats have been used as a standard research model. Their size and physical characteris-tics make them an effective model to study human physiology and disease. Because rats frequently are used in cardiovascular research, the echocardiographic alterations that occur in young rats need to be understood to evaluate possible changes that may occur during this period of development. Furthermore, rats have proven to be a well-accepted model for investigating the effects of physical activity. With a growing emphasis on the effect of lifelong exercise on cardiovascular health, rats could serve as an effective model to investigate the effects of exercise during the developmental phase of the lifespan. Although baseline echocardiographic values for adult rats have been reported, 33 little is known regarding the time course of changes in cardiac morphology and function in developing rats. Likewise, whether exercise initiated several days after weaning has an effect on the normal development of the rat heart, either in morphology or function, is unknown. The purpose of the cur-rent study was to characterize changes in cardiac structure and function in developing Sprague–Dawley rats and to investigate the effects of exercise training on these developmental changes. We hypothesized that exercise training during the developmen-tal stages of life would cause maturational changes in cardiac structure and function in male Sprague–Dawley rats...|$|E
40|$|Dwell {{time is the}} {{principal}} indicator of the Port’s efficiency. Dwell time can be broken into three components: operational dwell time, transactional dwell time and discretionary dwell time. All customs and terminal inefficiencies are absorbed {{in the first two}} components above. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine delivery patterns and find evidence of discretionary behaviours by the importers taking advantage of the long free storage time offered for transit containers. The study was conducted by extracting terminal handling data for import containers for the first quarter of 2014 from Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) terminal and linking this data with clearance data from Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) for the same container records so as to study the trends. Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient was used to determine the strength and direction of relationship between the two variables and was found to be equal to 0. 725 which shows strong positive correlation. The findings from the analysis suggest that the actual time required to complete customs and <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures</b> is very minimal and that the majority of the deliveries tend to happen in the last days of the expiry of free storage. The general impression from study findings is that delivery of containers is dictated by free time given at the Dar es Salaam Port; subsequently influencing average dwell time of the containers. The study recommends reduction of free time from 14 days to 7 days or less to meet a target of 5 days by 2015 and introduction of punitive demurrage fees to discourage importers from leaving their containers at the port despite finishing clearance processes. Lastly, findings like these should be made available to importers to justify new measures to be taken...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the fine anatomical organization of cortical inputs to visual association area TE, 2 – 3 small injections of retrograde tracers {{were made in}} macaque monkeys. Injections were made as a <b>terminal</b> <b>procedure,</b> after optical imaging and electrophysiological recording, and targeted to patches physiologically identified as object-selective. Retrogradely labeled neurons occurred in several unimodal visual areas, the superior temporal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and prefrontal cortex (PFC), consistent with previous studies. Despite the small injection size (< 0. 5 mm wide), the projection foci in visual areas, but not in IPS or PFC, were spatially widespread (4 – 6 mm in extent), and predominantly consisted of neurons labeled by {{only one of the}} injections. This {{can be seen as a}} quasi-modular organization. In addition, within each projection focus, there were scattered neurons projecting to one of the other injections, together with some double-labeled (DL) neurons, in a more distributed pattern. Finally, projection foci included smaller “hotspots,” consisting of intermixed neurons, single-labeled by the different injections, and DL neurons. DL neurons are likely the result of axons having extended, spatially separated terminal arbors, as demonstrated by anterograde experiments. These results suggest a complex, hybrid connectivity architecture, with both modular and distributed components...|$|R

40|$|IFR) traffic, Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{must rely}} on pilots to use charted airport {{sketches}} and diagrams as well as standard instrument departures (SIDs) and obstacle departure procedures (ODPs). While many charted (and uncharted) departures are based on radar vectors, the bulk of IFR departures in the NAS require pilots to navigate out of the terminal environment to the en route phase. IFR takeoffs and departures are fast-paced phases of flight, and pilots often are overloaded with critical flight information. During takeoff, pilots are busy requesting and receiving clearances, preparing their aircraft for departure, and taxiing to the active runway. During IFR conditions, they are doing this with minimal visibility, {{and they may be}} without constant radio communication if flying out of a non-towered airport. Historically, takeoff minimums for commercial operations have been successively reduced through a combination of improved signage, runway markings and lighting aids, and concentrated pilot training and qualifications. Today at major terminals, some commercial operators with appropriate equipment, pilot qualifications, and approved Operations Specifications (OpsSpecs) may takeoff with visibility as low as runway visual range (RVR) 3, or 300 feet runway visual range. One of the consequences of takeoffs with reduced visibility is that pilots are challenged in maintaining situational awareness during taxi operations. SURFACE MOVEMENT SAFETY One of the biggest safety concerns in aviation is the surface movement accident. As a direct result, the FAA has rapidly expanded the information available to pilots including the addition of taxiway and runway information in FAA publications, particularly the IFR U. S. <b>Terminal</b> <b>Procedures</b> Publication (TPP) booklets and Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) volumes. The FAA has also implemented new procedures and created educational and awareness programs for pilots, air traffic controllers, and ground operators. By focusing resources to attack this problem head on, the FAA hopes to reduce and eventually eliminate surface movement accidents.

Dr. Brandon Dixon {{began at}} Georgia Tech in August 2009 as an Assistant Professor. Prior {{to his current}} appointment, he was a staff {{scientist}} at Ecole Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology - Lausanne) doing research on tissue-engineered models of the lymphatic system. Dr. Dixon received his Ph. D. in biomedical engineering at Texas A&M University working in the Optical Biosensing Laboratory, where he developed an imaging system for measuring lymphatic flow and estimating wall shear stress in contracting lymphatic vessels. Dr. Dixon's current research focuses on developing imaging techniques and tissue-engineered model systems to enhance our ability to probe the underlying physiologic control of lymphatic pump function particularly {{as it relates to}} lipid metabolism and transport. Runtime: 57 : 43 minutesProper lymphatic function is essential to a variety of important physiologic processes including immune cell trafficking, lipid absorption, and the regulation of fluid balance. However, the experimental difficulties associated with making actual measurements on lymphatics have slowed our understanding of these processes. In vitro experiments on isolated primary lymphatic endothelial cells or lymphatic muscle cells remove the cell from its native biological and mechanical microenvironment, making the interpretation of results challenging. In vivo experiments, on the other hand, often require highly invasive and <b>terminal</b> <b>procedures</b> to access the vessels. In this talk I will describe several experimental platforms we have developed to assist in both of these issues. By culturing cells in microenvironments that more accurately recreate their biophysical and physiologic surroundings, we seek to not only better recapitulate the in vivo state, but to explore how changes in this mechanical environment participate in the pathogenesis of lymphatic disease. Through the use of NIR imaging techniques, we can perform longitudinal studies on lymphatic function and measure lymphatic pumping pressure in a minimally invasive fashion. Finally, we have developed several approaches using a fluorescently-labeled fatty acid analogue to quantify the dynamics of lipid transport by lymphatics both in vivo and in vitro and have evidence that lymphatic transport of lipid is not the passive process that it has been historically regarded to be...|$|E
