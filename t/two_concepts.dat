5|$|Fate of Atlantis {{was praised}} by critics and {{received}} several awards for best adventure {{game of the}} year. It became a million-unit seller and {{is widely regarded as}} a classic of its genre today. <b>Two</b> <b>concepts</b> for a supposed sequel were conceived, but both projects were eventually canceled due to unforeseen problems during development. They were later reworked into two separate Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs and Elaine Lee, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Alma Books, Whitehead states {{that the concept of}} the book originated from an article about the naming process for new pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. The article made Whitehead question how a similar process is used to assert a certain control over one's environment (his example is a boulevard named after a particular person), and yoking the <b>two</b> <b>concepts</b> {{was the beginning of the}} ideas that led to his composition of the novel.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over {{defining}} URLs and URNs it became evident that the <b>two</b> <b>concepts</b> embodied by the terms were merely aspects of the fundamental, overarching notion of resource identification. In June 1994, the IETF published Berners-Lee's RFC 1630: the first Request for Comments that acknowledged the existence of URLs and URNs, and, more importantly, defined a formal syntax for Universal Resource Identifiers— URL-like strings whose precise syntaxes and semantics depended on their schemes. In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It also acknowledged, but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the <b>two</b> <b>concepts</b> together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

3000|$|ESA {{utilizes}} a cosine metric {{to compute}} the semantic relatedness of <b>two</b> <b>concept</b> vectors. Hassan and Mihalcea (2009) replaced cosine similarity with a Lesk-like metric. Martín et al. (2013) explored two similarity measurements of <b>two</b> <b>concept</b> vectors: a cosine and a generalized jaccard. Sorg and Cimiano (2010) explored the TFIDF, KL-divergence, and LM schemes in addition to cosine similarity. Aggarwal et al. (2012) proposed TunedESA, an ESA with an added tuning feature. This method tunes the ESA with three WordNet-based Lin semantic similarities of word functions in two sentences — the subject, action, and object of each sentence. Yan and Jin (2012) integrated the TFIDF similarity score with the ESA-based similarity score. Szarvas et al. (2011) proposed a new similarity measurement: [...]...|$|R
25|$|These <b>two</b> <b>concepts</b> of {{infinity}} and reality {{lie at the}} heart of Unger's program calling for metaphysical and institutional revolutions. From the concept of the self as infinite but constrained, Unger argues that we must continually transform our environment to better express ourselves. This can only be done in a singular world within which time is real.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a scalar valued fitness {{function}} f(s) also corresponds to the {{concept of a}} potential or energy function in physics. The <b>two</b> <b>concepts</b> only differ in that physicists traditionally think in terms of minimizing the potential function, while biologists prefer the notion that fitness is being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a potential function turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Every {{partial order}} ≤ {{gives rise to}} a {{so-called}} strict order <, by defining a < b if a ≤ b and not b ≤ a. This transformation can be inverted by setting a ≤ b if a < b or a = b.

25|$|With {{regard to}} the latter extreme, the Court of Appeal held {{that the concept of}} a real risk should not be equated with the concept of a clear and present danger as the <b>two</b> <b>concepts</b> have {{different}} meanings. The concept of a clear and present danger is a more stringent standard compared to the concept of a real risk. The latter encompasses the former but not vice versa.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 the College's {{status in}} the University of London was {{extended}} for a further five years, with unlimited membership achieved in May 1915.
