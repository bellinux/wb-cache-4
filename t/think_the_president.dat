2500|$|In August 2002, {{appearing}} on CNN's Crossfire, Fossella argued for partly privatizing Social Security and allow {{some of the}} funds be placed on Wall Street investments. He said [...] "I happen to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> {{is on the right}} side of history here. And I think the more you empower American people, the more you give them the opportunity to invest on their own and being in control of their own destiny and their own retirement, the better off we'll be." [...] In a standardized constituent letter in February 2005, Fossella said [...] "We need to examine the viability of voluntary personal savings accounts in which young people would have the opportunity to invest a small portion of their savings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tracey Mann, a {{candidate}} running for Congress from Kansas in 2010, stated at {{a candidate}} forum that Obama [...] "should show his birth certificate to really resolve this thing {{one way or}} another". In a radio interview, he answered a question as [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the United States needs to come forth with his papers and show everyone that he's an American citizen and put this issue to bed once and for all." [...] In response, on July 21, 2010, The Hutchinson News, a local paper in Hutchinson, Kansas, withdrew their endorsement of Mann, saying that Mann [...] "questions the citizenship of President Barack Obama despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective, rational people– including a birth certificate released by the Hawaii {{secretary of state and}} birth announcements printed in Honolulu's two major newspapers". Mann responded that he was [...] "disappointed and mystified by the Hutchinson News decision to withdraw their endorsement over a misunderstanding of [...] position", as he is not [...] "interested in pursuing this issue in Congress", and he has [...] "never had any interest in spending any time on the matter". Mann was subsequently defeated in the Republican primary by state senator Tim Huelskamp.|$|E
2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E

2500|$|When asked {{during the}} Meet the Press {{interview}} {{if she would}} take back her previous comments that Obama [...] "may have anti-American views" [...] and that his administration had [...] "embraced something called gangster government", Bachmann backed her statements, saying [...] "I do believe that actions {{that have been taken}} by this White House—I don't take back my statements on gangster government. I think that there have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt...

It looked as if Adam did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> would win, but for all that meant to stand by him. Although not fastidious about his business methods, Adam had his code and was not afraid, when friendship demanded it, to fight for a lost cause. Moreover, Kit meant to fight with him. Then he {{got up and}} smiled. Adam meant well, but he was clumsy; if he had wanted to save Kit from sharing his risk, he might have made a better plan.|$|E

I think the nation is doing fine. But, if there's just one thing where they're wrong, it's in the matter of the theatres. I think it would be much better for the Government not to attempt to cut down or regulate theatres in any way. The theatre is the people's recreation. It builds them up. It's all part of a great machine to win the war. I like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel that the theatre is doing its bit. But, mind you, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is doing fine. So, all I say is, I think the theatres ought to be allowed to do fine, too." ...|$|E
60|$|We are now up {{and have}} a {{continuous}} line of troops, {{and in a few}} hours will be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river above. Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were not captured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part or because they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corps is above them. Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White Oak Road to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he met them, and at last accounts was engaged with them. Not knowing whether Sheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with another division from here. The whole captures since the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery. I do not know the number of men and guns accurately however. * * * I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> might come out and pay us a visit tomorrow.|$|E
60|$|Not so Leghorn (made illustrious by SMOLLETT'S grave), {{which is}} a thriving, business-like, matter-of-fact place, where idleness is {{shouldered}} {{out of the way}} by commerce. The regulations observed there, in reference to trade and merchants, are very liberal and free; and the town, of course, benefits by them. Leghorn had a bad name in connection with stabbers, and with some justice it must be allowed; for, not many years ago, there was an assassination club there, the members of which bore no ill-will to anybody in particular, but stabbed people (quite strangers to them) in the streets at night, for the pleasure and excitement of the recreation. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of this amiable society was a shoemaker. He was taken, however, and the club was broken up. It would, probably, have disappeared in the natural course of events, before the railroad between Leghorn and Pisa, {{which is a}} good one, and has already begun to astonish Italy with a precedent of punctuality, order, plain dealing, and improvement--the most dangerous and heretical astonisher of all. There must have been a slight sensation, as of earthquake, surely, in the Vatican, when the first Italian railroad was thrown open.|$|E
5000|$|On August 19, 2010, {{when asked}} by CNN {{correspondent}} John King if he had doubts that President Barack Obama is a Christian, Graham stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> problem {{is that he was}} born a Muslim, his father was a Muslim. The seed of Islam is passed through the father like the seed of Judaism is passed through the mother. He was born a Muslim, his father gave him an Islamic name." [...] Graham continues to say, [...] "Now it's obvious that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> has renounced <b>the</b> prophet Mohammed, and he has renounced Islam, and he has accepted Jesus Christ. That's what he says he has done. I cannot say that he hasn't. So I just have to believe that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> is what he has said."
