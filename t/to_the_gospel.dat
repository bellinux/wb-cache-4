5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E
5|$|The Recognitions of Clement {{contains}} a source document (Rec. 1.27–71), conventionally {{referred to by}} scholars as the Ascents of James, which {{is believed to be}} of Jewish–Christian origin. The Ascents shares a similarity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites with regard to the baptism of the Pharisees by John (Pan. 30.13.4; Rec. 1.54.6–7) and the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices, adding that a Christian water baptism is to be substituted for the remission of sins. Based on these similarities, scholars Richard Bauckham and F. Stanley Jones have postulated a direct dependence of the Ascents of James on the Gospel of the Ebionites.|$|E
5|$|The early Church Fathers {{believed}} {{there was only one}} Jewish–Christian gospel, perhaps in different versions; however, scholars have long recognized the possibility there were at least two or three. Jerome's references to a Gospel of the Hebrews, or variants of that name, are particularly problematic because it is unclear which gospel he is referring to as the source of his quotations. Hegesippus, Eusebius, and Jerome all used an Aramaic gospel, which Jerome referred to as the gospel used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes. Gospel of the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe the fragments of quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic gospel that was based on traditions similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew. A third gospel was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis, which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites. Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek gospel harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as the Gospel of the Ebionites. The existence of three independent Jewish–Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus. However, that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of the gospel known to the Nazarenes and its relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews. The relationship between the Gospel of the Hebrews and the other Jewish–Christian gospels, as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel, is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Gospel of the Ebionites, the Gospel of the Hebrews, and the Gospel of the Nazarenes remains unclear. All the Jewish–Christian gospels survive only as fragments in quotations, so {{it is difficult to}} tell if they are independent texts or variations of each other. Scholar Albertus Klijn established the modern consensus, concluding that the gospel harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius. Scholar Marie-Émile Boismard has claimed the Ebionite gospel is partly dependent upon a hypothetical Hebrew gospel as a source; however this conjecture remains a minority view. Its putative relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> text known to Origen as the Gospel of the Twelve remains a subject of scholarly debate.|$|E

40|$|Jesus and exorcism: an {{investigation}} of Jesus’ dealing with demons according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> In view of present-day reports of demon-possession and often disputable practices of exorcism, a study is made of these phenomena in <b>the</b> <b>Gospels.</b> According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> demon- possession was a stark reality. Through his exorcistic activities Jesus demonstrated his absolute authority over Satan and his demons.
