5|$|If Hahn's {{account is}} disregarded, the Mascarene parrot {{probably}} became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on Réunion {{is from the}} 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went extinct in the wild while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens {{are known to have}} lived there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French author, explorer, and naturalist François Levaillant stated that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> rare and that he had seen three specimens in France.|$|E

5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{disappearance}} of the Rodrigues rail may {{have been caused by}} introduced cats, but {{it is also possible that}} deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an {{extinct species}} of rail from the Chatham Islands, {{as a new}} species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews and the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Péron's {{interview}} describes {{some aspects}} of the behaviour of the King Island emu. He writes that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. They ate berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to flee from the hunting dogs of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict a great deal of harm.|$|E

50|$|A common urban legend {{holds that}} <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> {{depicted}} <b>are</b> herons. In 2008, {{representatives from the}} Danish Ornithological Society stated {{that this is not}} true and that <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> in fact storks.|$|R
5|$|The Rodrigues rail is {{believed}} to have become extinct in the mid-18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters. Apart from information gathered from subfossil bones, the bird is poorly known and was only documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts, but no such illustrations. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> first mentioned by François Leguat, a French Huguenot refugee marooned on Rodrigues in 1691, and was named E. leguati in his honour in 1874. The second account was by Julien Tafforet, also marooned on the island in 1726. Subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with the old accounts.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{starling}} (Necropsar rodericanus) is an {{extinct species}} of starling that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. Its closest relatives were the Mauritius starling and the hoopoe starling from nearby islands; all three {{appear to be}} of Southeast Asian origin. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore islet of Île Gombrani. Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested {{to belong to the}} bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause for}} the {{extinction}} of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of elephant seals. Péron's interview with Daniel Cooper suggested that they likely contributed {{to the demise of}} the bird by hunting it, and perhaps by starting fires. Péron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to have killed no fewer than 300 emus himself. Cooper had been on the island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month. His group of sealers consisted of eleven men as well as his wife, and they alone may have killed 3,600 emus by the time Péron visited them.|$|E

5|$|The hoopoe {{starling}} {{was kept}} as a cagebird on Réunion and Mauritius, and although <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> becoming scarcer, {{a number of}} specimens were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed {{a wide variety of}} food, such as bananas, potatoes, and chayote, and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. However, the Mauritian population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on Réunion during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The hoopoe {{starling}}, {{also known}} as the Réunion starling or Bourbon crested starling (Fregilupus varius), is a species of starling which lived on the Mascarene island of Réunion, and became extinct in the 1850s. Its closest relatives were the Rodrigues starling and the Mauritius starling from nearby islands, and the three apparently originated in Southeast Asia. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought {{to be related to the}} hoopoe, from which its name is derived. Although a number of affinities have been proposed, it was confirmed as a starling in a DNA study.|$|E
