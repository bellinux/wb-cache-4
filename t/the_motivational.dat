5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. <b>The</b> <b>motivational</b> {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. <b>The</b> <b>motivational</b> system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are threefold. First, we {{investigate}} the influence of <b>the</b> parent-initiated <b>motivational</b> climate upon elite junior athletes’ perfectionistic cognitions. Second, we examine whether <b>the</b> coach-created <b>motivational</b> climate predicts additional variance in elite junior athletes’ perfectionistic cognitions beyond the effects associated with <b>the</b> parentinitiated <b>motivational</b> climate. Third, we test the moderating role of athletes’ gender and age in the relationship between the parent-initiated and coach-created motivational climates and athletes’ perfectionistic cognitions. A total of 190 elite junior athletes (mean age 15. 2 years, s¼ 1. 5, range 10 – 18) completed <b>the</b> Parent-Initiated <b>Motivational</b> Climate Questionnaire- 2 (White & Duda, 1993), <b>the</b> Perceived <b>Motivational</b> Climate in Sport Questionnaire- 2 (Newton, Duda, & Yin, 2000), and the Perfectionistic Cognitions Inventory (Flett, Hewitt, Blankstein, & Gray, 1998). Regression analyses revealed that mother- and father-initiated worry-conducive climates, the father-initiated success-without-effort climate, and <b>the</b> coach-created performance <b>motivational</b> climate predicted male athletes’ perfectionistic cognitions. Female athletes’ perfectionistic cognitions were predicted by the mother-initiated worry-conducive climate, father-initiated learningenjoyment climate, and both dimensions of the coach-created climate. Finally, athletes’ gender emerged as a significant moderator of the mother-initiated worry-conducive climate and athletes’ perfectionistic cognitions relationship. Findings confirm that <b>the</b> parent-initiated <b>motivational</b> climate is a significant predictor of athletes’ perfectionism-related thoughts, and provide initial support for the influence of the coach-created motivation climate over children’s perfectionistic cognitions...|$|R

This is <b>the</b> <b>motivational</b> phase of the model. The predictive effect of motivational self-efficacy on behaviour is assumed to be mediated by recovery self-efficacy, and the effects of intentions are assumed to be mediated by planning. The latter processes refer to the volitional phase of the model.|$|E

25|$|The results {{reported}} in Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding <b>the</b> <b>Motivational</b> Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity (2004) {{indicate that the}} occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the left frontal cortex, a brain structure also associated with the emotion of anger; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex. Applying a directional model of Approach motivation, the study Anger and the Behavioural Approach System (2003) indicated that the relation between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful situation, {{he or she is}} without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of intent analysis, {{reflecting}} two meanings of the word intent. The first, a rule of common law construction during the Founding Era, is functional intent. The second is motivational intent. To understand the difference, one can use the metaphor of an architect who designs a Gothic church with flying buttresses. The functional intent of flying buttresses is to prevent the weight of the roof from spreading the walls and causing a collapse of the building, which can be inferred from examining the design as a whole. <b>The</b> <b>motivational</b> intent might be to create work for his brother-in-law who is a flying buttress subcontractor. Using original intent analysis of the first kind, we can discern that the language of Article III of the U.S. Constitution was to delegate to Congress the power to allocate original and appellate jurisdictions, and not to remove some jurisdiction, involving a constitutional question, from all courts. That would suggest that the decision was wrong in Ex Parte McCardle.|$|E

500|$|In {{the reward}} system, reward is the {{attractive}} and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior [...] (also known as approach behavior) – and consummatory behavior. A rewarding stimulus {{is one that}} has the potential to cause an approach to it and a choice to be made to consume it or not. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, pleasure provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinstic rewards like money). <b>The</b> <b>motivational</b> or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasurable component of intrinstic rewards is derived from the consummatory behavior that ensues upon acquiring them. [...] A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where [...] "wanting" [...] or desire (less commonly, [...] "seeking") corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior.}} In human drug addicts, [...] "wanting" [...] becomes dissociated with [...] "liking" [...] as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance.|$|E

Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) calls her, {{but she does not}} answer or come, so Karev cries to fellow resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner). Shepherd spends ten hours in the operating room contemplating {{what to do about the}} tumor, with <b>the</b> <b>motivational</b> support of fellow surgeons Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). Webber orders Shepherd to end the surgery because he is wasting hospital resources. Shortly thereafter, Isaac awakens to Shepherd explaining that the surgery would not have been possible without paralyzing him. Isaac convinces Shepherd to operate again in secret the next day, and the latter maps out a diagram of the surgery on his bedroom wall while discussing it with his wife Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), who is home on bed rest after donating part of her liver to her father in the episode [...] "Tainted Obligation". Backed by his fellow attendings, Shepherd obtains Webber's permission to cut the chord but tells Avery and Lexie that they were not cutting the chord and playing by ear instead. He removes all but a tiny section of the tumor. Webber discovers that Shepherd is operating and is about to put an end to it, but Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) tells him to go away. Shepherd has to cut a nerve to remove the rest of the tumor, but does not know which will result in paralysis. He decides with a game of [...] "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe", ultimately cutting the correct nerve and eliminating the entirety of the tumor. Despite the successful surgery, Webber is enraged and verbally fires Shepherd. Shepherd dismisses this in a light tone and goes home to drink champagne with his wife.|$|E
