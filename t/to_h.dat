5|$|Let G < H denote {{that there}} is a {{homomorphism}} from G <b>to</b> <b>H,</b> but no homomorphism from H to G.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{injective}} homomorphism from G <b>to</b> <b>H</b> (i.e., {{one that}} never maps distinct vertices to one vertex) if {{and only if}} G is a subgraph of H.|$|E
5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism <b>to</b> <b>H</b> corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G <b>to</b> <b>H.</b>|$|E

We assigned {{them to the}} seven barley chromosomes (1 <b>H</b> <b>to</b> 7 <b>H)</b> by PCR analysis using a set of wheat-barley chromosome addition lines. We successfully assigned 701 (49. 3 %) EST markers to the barley chromosomes: 75 <b>to</b> 1 <b>H,</b> 127 <b>to</b> 2 <b>H,</b> 119 <b>to</b> 3 <b>H,</b> 94 <b>to</b> 4 <b>H,</b> 108 <b>to</b> 5 <b>H,</b> 81 <b>to</b> 6 <b>H</b> and 97 <b>to</b> 7 <b>H.</b> By using a set of Betzes barley telosomic addition lines of Chinese Spring, we could successfully determine the chromosome-arm (S or L) location of at least 90 % of the EST markers assigned to each barley chromosome.

5|$|H. altispinus, {{the type}} species, is known from 5 to 10 {{articulated}} skulls with some associated skeletal remains, from juvenile to adult individuals {{found in the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation. H. stebingeri is known from an unknown but substantial number of individuals, with an age range of embryos to adults. The hypothesis that H. altispinus and H. stebingeri form a natural group excluding other known hadrosaur species may be incorrect, as noted in Suzuki et al.s 2004 redescription of Nipponosaurus; their phylogenetic analysis found that Nipposaurus was more closely related <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> altispinus than H. stebingeri was <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> altispinus.

5|$|The {{slightly}} older Two Medicine Formation, home <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> stebingeri, was also populated by another well-known nesting hadrosaur, Maiasaura, {{as well as}} the troodontid Troodon, which is also known from nesting traces. The tyrannosaurid Daspletosaurus, caenagnathid Chirostenotes, dromaeosaurids Bambiraptor and Saurornitholestes, armored dinosaurs Edmontonia, Oohkotokia, and Scolosaurus, hypsilophodont Orodromeus, hadrosaur Prosaurolophus, and horned dinosaurs Achelousaurus, Brachyceratops, Einiosaurus, and Rubeosaurus were also present. This formation was more distant from the Western Interior Seaway, higher and drier, with a more terrestrial influence.|$|E
5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> huangi or a similar species. The other egg has a much less developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved. While this does not permit comparison on the species level, the tibia (shinbone) confirms {{that it is an}} oviraptorosaur.|$|E

5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, {{all the way}} to Track H from east to west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, all the way <b>to</b> <b>H</b> as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this had not been a problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Reddy and Desai soon soured {{over the}} latter's {{promotion}} of his son, Kanti Desai, {{in politics and}} over Desai's communication with Chief Ministers Vengala Rao and Channa Reddy {{on the issue of}} land ceilings in Andhra Pradesh. Following mass defections from the Janata Party and from the cabinet, Morarji Desai's 30-month-old government ended in July 1979 after he handed in his resignation to Reddy before a no-confidence motion could be tabled against his government in Parliament. Reddy's actions following Desai's resignation have been much debated. His decision to accept Desai's resignation before an alternative government created a ministerial vacuum in the executive according <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> M. Seervai. The faction of the Janata Party supporting Desai continued to have the support of 205 MPs as opposed to Charan Singh's 80 MPs. Reddy used presidential discretion in choosing Charan Singh as the next Prime Minister over a contending claim from Jagjivan Ram, the leader of the Janata Party.|$|E
5|$|Samonds {{also found}} Hipposideros {{material}} in other sites at Anjohibe, {{but did not}} assign it to H.besaoka. In Old SE, also at most 10,000 years old, a single fourth upper premolar (P4) was found with dimensions different from those seen in both H.commersoni and H.besaoka and lacking a cusp on the front lingual (inner) corner, present in both other species; Samonds assigned this specimen to Hipposideros sp. cf. H.commersoni. In NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), a lower incisor and a third lower molar (m3) were found; these teeth resemble H.commersoni and are distinct from H.besaoka, so Samonds assigned them to the former species. Locality SS2, {{which could not be}} dated, contained a few teeth and isolated jaws of Hipposideros. Some of these showed measurements distinct from both Hipposideros species, rendering the assignment of the material doubtful; Samonds referred it <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> sp. cf. H.commersoni.|$|E

She was then used as a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven, a role she filled {{until the end of}} the war. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. The navy planned to convert her into a salvage ship, but the plan was abandoned and she was instead sold for 425,000marks <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> Peters in Wewelsfleth.

5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G <b>to</b> <b>H</b> is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray {{is closely}} related <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> undulata and H. leoparda, which share much of its range. All three species are very similar in size, shape, and color pattern, resulting in {{a long history of}} taxonomic confusion that only recently is starting to be untangled. In 2004, Mabel Manjaji described the 'uarnak' species complex, containing H. fai, H. gerrardi, H. jenkinsii, H. leoparda, H. toshi, H. uarnak, and H. undulata, plus three more undescribed species. The reticulate whipray itself varies in appearance throughout its range, and further taxonomic comparisons are required to determine whether its spotted and reticulated color morphs in fact represent different species. Alternate common names for this ray include coachwhip ray, leopard stingray, longtail stingray, and marbled stingray; some of these names are shared by other, similar species.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> pylori infection.|$|E
5|$|As the new battleships were {{intended}} for offensive operations, the Siegfried class was still retained for coast defense duties. The ships served in this capacity through {{the start of}} World War I, until they were withdrawn from active service in 1915.

All six ships were struck from the naval register on 17 June 1919, shortly before the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the First World War, was signed. Siegfried was a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven from 1916. She was intended to be rebuilt as a salvage ship, but this plan was abandoned and the vessel was sold <b>to</b> <b>H.</b> Peters, Wewelsfleth in 1919 for 425,000 marks.

Frithjof was a barracks ship in Danzig after 1916. Following her removal from navy service, she was sold to A Bernstein in Hamburg. She was rebuilt as a freighter by Deutsche Werke, and served in this capacity until she was broken up in 1930. She was the longest serving Siegfried-class ship.|$|E
