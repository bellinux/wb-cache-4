Additionally, in a quite rapid pace a shipbuilding industry started growing, this caused many people to migrate from the region and into the Tricity. In the 1960s, a large amount tourism started developing intensively, allowing the region to become a rich region, particularly in the Kartuzy region - the poorest district was the Gdańsk region. In the 1970s, Gdańsk and Gdynia's city limits had expanded into the region. After the political transformation, <b>tourist</b> <b>movements</b> had diminished, additionally a large quantity of big industrial plants had closed down - impoverishing the population; causing an increase of the population {{to come back to}} agriculture. When Poland had entered the European Union, this caused both financial benefits (EU funds {{for the development of the}} region) as well as an increase in the cultural diversity in the region, as many Kashubian institutions, and the Kashubian language was declared an official language - which was not possible during the times of the Polish People's Republic.|$|E

This article fills this gap both theoretically and empirically, through an analysis of the time-space activity of tourists staying at four hotels in different areas of Hong Kong. The movements of 557 tourists' day-trips were tracked using GPS loggers. The study concluded that hotel location has a profound impact on <b>tourist</b> <b>movements,</b> with a large share of the total tourist time budget spent in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.

The {{study examines}} 56 jurisdictions in six geographical regions that were once colonies of or remain the possessions of eight nations. Residents of Europe and America show a preference for travel to destinations with strong historical/political ties and an equally strong aversion to travel to jurisdictions where no such connection exists. Likewise, destinations rely heavily on former colonizers as a key source of visitors, especially from long-haul markets. Such a pattern is not evident among either source European markets without a strong colonial history or destination countries without a colonial past. The lingering effects of colonialism are especially noticeable among French and Dutch tourists.

Share of trade and catering business in general tourist expenditures is significant. In consideration of that tourist economy finds itself in a sphere of interests of trade in many countries. <b>Tourist</b> <b>movement</b> presents different demand in comparison with demand of resident population. Tourist demand is also internally differentiated. It causes significant difficulties for determination of its sizes and structure. Concentration is a fundamental separate feature of tourist demand.

Using a massive open-data source of photographic metadata from the Flickr photograph sharing platform, we extract time-stamps and geographic coordinates from photo metadata to analyze activity and movement patterns of international visitors to Canada. This analysis allows us to protect privacy while identifying rich and interesting patterns of tourist activity at both national and urban scales. The data further allows us to generate constructed tourist itineraries using extracted spatio-temporal data for anonymized individual users. In this presentation we highlight several use cases and applications that rely on this data that we believe may be useful for government organizations, destination marketing organizations, and the tourism industry in general: distribution of tourist activity across geographies, the differential spatial patterns of international tourists and locals, inter-provincial <b>tourist</b> <b>movement,</b> as well as intra-urban <b>tourist</b> <b>movement</b> networks and attraction clustering.
