40|$|Novel “ECO Mg” alloys, i. e., CaO-added Mg alloys, which exhibit {{oxidation}} resistance during melting and casting processes, {{even without the}} use of beryllium or <b>toxic</b> <b>protection</b> gases such as SF 6, have recently been introduced. Research on ECO Mg alloys is still continuing, and their application as welding filler metals was investigated in this study. Mechanical and metallurgical aspects of the weldments were analysed after welding, and welding behaviours such as fume generation and droplet transfer were observed during welding. The tensile strength of welds was slightly increased by adding CaO to the filler metal, which resulted from the decreased grain size in the weld metal. When welding Mg alloys, fumes have been unavoidable so far because of the low boiling temperature of Mg. Fume reduction was successfully demonstrated with a wire composed of the novel ECO Mg filler. In addition, stable droplet transfer was observed and spatter suppression could be expected by using CaO-added Mg filler wire...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the {{problems related to}} exercises that allow to prepare people, military equipment, and other rescue groups to prevent and minimize the number of victims {{in the case of}} the use of modern means of poisonous or radioactive ones. Such exercises can be carried out in the facility that is hermetically separated from the external environment, and a functional system of chambers allows to exercise and carry out activities that may occur in the real world after the use of toxic or radioactive warfare agents. These agents could cause disease in humans and degradation of natural environment. The tunnel enables to hold adequate exercises that familiarize practitioners with the correct principles to identify the toxic substance, and then to follow safe handling of their disposal with uniforms, weapons, and equipment. Certain chambers do protection of the skin and the respiratory tract against a particular toxin through a secure procedure for removing protective clothing and bath under the shower disinfectant and hygiene, to finally wear clean clothing or uniforms.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{general rules}} {{for the use of}} collective protection against contamination. There are presented certain recommendations for functional and operational requirements in the case of collective protection measures. The functional and maintenance recommendations are described in the field of the collective protection against modern agents in the concern of the hardened facilities in relation to the ventilation systems and objects themselves. Individual protection is a key element of dealing in the massive destruction weapon (MDW) environment. The protective cloth provides the capability of working in a contaminated area but it makes individuals less operable and effective, also in the lasting. The common collec-tive protection is organized for people (solders or civilians) to be able to operate in a contaminated area. It means, that there are necessary certain facilities which protect personnel against toxics. The point of the collective protection is to keep an environment adequate for defense missions, rest, or decontamination. These facilities give more light feeling in the physical and psychological sense of dealing without the individual protective cloth. There is also a description of the ventilation system’ objects, {{depending on the type of}} collective protection systems.

40|$|The Dutch plant {{protection}} policy aims at reaching sustainable {{agriculture in the}} Netherlands. Operational goals {{with respect to the}} environment for the year 2010 compared to the year 1998 are: a reduction of 95 % of the environmental impact on surface water and a reduction of 95 % of bottle-necks in the production of drinking water from surface water. Midterm goals are 75 % and 50 % respectively. The calculated environmental impact as a result of drift emissions to surface water was reduced with 86 %. Drift reduction measures, imposed since 2000, contributed most to this calculated reduction. The second most important contribution came from the use of less <b>toxic</b> plant <b>protection</b> products. Concentrations of {{plant protection}} product residues measured in surface waters declined over the study period, but still concentrations above maximum permissible levels occurred in 2004. The number of bottle-necks in the production of drinking water from surface water was diminished from 33 to 27; the midterm goal was not met. This was partly due to non-agricultural use of plant protection products and foreign sources. Experiments show that changes in plant protection strategies and management at the farm level may further reduce the environmental impact of plant protection products. Implementation of these innovations requires widespread dissemination of the results...|$|R

500|$|Chemical defences are {{widespread}} and are mostly based on chemicals of plant origin. In {{many cases the}} plants themselves evolved these <b>toxic</b> substances as <b>protection</b> against herbivores. Butterflies have evolved mechanisms to sequester these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence. These defence mechanisms are effective {{only if they are}} well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in unpalatable butterflies (aposematism). This signal is commonly mimicked by other butterflies, usually only females. [...] A Batesian mimic imitates another species to enjoy the protection of that species' aposematism. The common Mormon of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the common rose and the crimson rose. Müllerian mimicry occurs when aposematic species evolve to resemble each other, presumably to reduce predator sampling rates; Heliconius butterflies from the Americas are a good example.|$|R
40|$|New {{pesticides}} {{based on}} plant extracts have recently gained {{interest in the}} development of non 21 <b>toxic</b> crop <b>protection</b> chemicals. Numerous research studies are focused on the isolation and 22 identification of new active compounds derived from plants. In this manuscript we report about the 23 use of the Mediterranean species Capparis spinosa as a potent natural nematicidal agent against the 24 root knot nematodes Meloidogyne incognita. Leaves, stems, and caper buds of Capparis spinosa 25 were used to obtain their methanol extracts (LME, SME, BME) that were successively in vitro 26 tested against second stage nematode juveniles (J 2). In terms of paralysis induction, the methanol 27 extract of the stem part (SME) was found more effective against M. incognita and then the caper 28 methanol buds and leaves extracts. The chemical composition analysis of the extracts carried out 29 by GC/MS and LC/MS techniques showed that methylisothiocyanate was the main compound of 30 SME. The EC 50 for SME after 3 days of immersion was 215 ± 36 mg/L. The constituent 31 components of SME such as 2 -thiophenecarboxaldehyde and methylisothiocyanate were 32 successively in vitro tested for their nematicidal activity against J 2. Both compounds induced 33 paralysis on root knot nematodes ranking first (EC 50 = 7. 9 ± 1. 6, and 14. 1 ± 1. 9 mg/L respectively) 34 for M. incognita.

40|$|Ehrlichia chaffeensis are small, obligately intracellular, endosomal {{bacteria}} with tropism for macrophages. Persistent {{infection in}} reservoir white-tailed deer is transmitted by lone star ticks. Flu-like illness can progress to severe multisystem disease with toxic shock-like syndrome, meningitis, or ARDS. The case-fatality rate is 2. 7 %.

40|$|Metallothioneins (MT) {{are small}} and cysteine-rich {{proteins}} that bind metal ions such as zinc, copper, cadmium, and nickel 1. Several functions were proposed for these peptides, ranging from <b>toxic</b> metal <b>protection</b> to physiological metal homeostasis, free radical scavenging, oxidative stress protection, antiapoptotic defense, control of the redox status of the cell and also roles during development. Previously, we reported the identification of five different MT homologues (PlMT 4 - 8) from the Mediterranean sea urchin species P. lividus 2. In order to {{shed some light on}} MT gene structure and evolution, we cloned seven P. lividus MT genes, comparing them to Echinodermata and Chordata genes 3. Moreover, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of newly identified MTs from different classes of echinoderms and from the most ancient chordates, highlighting the relationships between them. Since MTs have multiple roles in the cells, we performed RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization experiments to understand better MT functions in sea urchin embryos. Results showed that the expression of MTs is regulated throughout development in a cell type-specific manner and in response to various metals 3. The MT 7 transcript is expressed in all tissues, especially in the stomach and in the intestine of the larva, but it is less metal-responsive. In contrast, MT 8 is ectodermic and rises only at relatively high metal doses. MT 5 and MT 6 expression is highly stimulated by metals in the mesenchyme cells. Our results suggest that the P. lividus MT family originated by gene duplications and evolved developmental and environmental sub-functionalization. A preliminary in silico promoter analysis showed interesting similarities and differences among these genes...|$|R
40|$|Glutathione, {{the most}} {{abundant}} non-enzymatic cellular thiol, regulates the redox environment through a balance of its reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG) forms. Its antioxidant tasks include the defence against oxidative damages caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), detoxification from <b>toxic</b> compounds, <b>protection</b> from oxidation of protein sulfhydryls. Hence, this tripeptide affects many cellular functions, such as tran- sport, metabolism, cell cycle, carcinogenesis, apoptosis; furthermore, it {{is involved in the}} post-translational regulation of protein functions through the S-glutathionylation of specific cysteine residues. The enzyme me- chanism for GSH biosynthesis is conserved throughout prokaryotes and eukaryotes and includes two sequen- tial steps for the assemblage of glutamate, cysteine and glycine into GSH, the driving force being guaranteed by the hydrolysis of ATP. In most prokaryotes, the two reaction steps are catalysed by two distinct enzymes, γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligase (GshA) and glutathione synthetase (GshB). In this work, the GSH biosynthesis was investigated {{for the first time in}} a cold-adapted microorganism, such as Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. This psychrophile, perfectly adapted to ROS protection, exhibits intriguing features in the functional role and biosynthesis of GSH. First, some antioxidant enzymes from this source are S-glutathionylated; second, differently from other proka- ryotes containing a single GshA and GshB, P. haloplanktis has two redundant GshA gene products (GshA I and GshA II) besides one GshB. In this study a detailed characterization of the recombinant forms of these enzymes was realised, focusing on the different role played by the redundant GshAs. The cold adaptations of the three enzymes of P. haloplanktis were compared and two distinct complete systems for GSH synthesis were reconstituted and analysed in order to dissect partial and complete reaction rates for GSH biosynthesis, even for potential biotechnological applications...|$|R

The total minimum amount of heat, Qm, required to cook 1 kg of dry rice, 1 kg of dry beans, 1 kg of raw potato and 1 kg of goat meat using the new technique of cooking with a stove of power 626 + 10 W are found as: 562 + 3 kJ, 708 + 4 kJ, 278 + 2 kJ, 716 + 4 kJ respectively.

40|$|Metallothioneins (MTs) {{constitute}} a heterogeneous superfamily of cysteine rich proteins, which coordinate divalent (Zn 2 +, Cd 2 +) or monovalent (Cu+) metal ions. Several functions {{have been proposed}} for these peptides, ranging from <b>toxic</b> metal <b>protection</b> to physiological metal homeostasis, free radical scavenging, oxidative stress protection, antiapoptotic defense, control of the redox status of the cell and also a role during development. Regarding the MT system in vertebrates’ nearest kin, little information is available at present. Recently MTs were also characterized in cephalochordates. Hence in order to {{shed some light on}} MT origin and functional differentiation through evolution, we studied MT genes in sea urchin P. lividus. Here we report the characterization of five different sea urchin MT genes (PlMT 4 through PlMT 8) and their regulation pattern during development. By Southern blot hybridization using MT 4 through MT 8 cDNA fragments as probes (Ragusa et al, 2013), we determined the number of MT genes in the genome, showing the presence of at least two different PlMT 8 genes. Using primers based on P. lividus (v 2. 0) genome sequences, we amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced the MT genes. PlMT gene structures are different from both vertebrates and cephalochordates. The genes are composed of 4 exons separated by 3 introns, the last intron is into the 3 'UTR. In PlMT 7 gene there are two predicted polyadenylation signals and in fact two species of mRNA transcripts exist. By RT-qPCR we showed that MT 4 to MT 6 are not expressed during development, while MT 7 mRNA level rises throughout embryonic development and MT 8 rises until gastrula stage and decreases thereafter. Analyzing MT promoters in silico, a considerable number of transcription factor binding elements can be identified, comprising putative metal response elements (MRE), antioxidant response elements (ARE), but their copy number and positions are different between constitutive (MT 7 - 8) and induced (MT 4 / 6) genes...|$|R
40|$|Background. Staphylococcal enterotoxins （SEs） are {{the most}} common cause of food-borne {{diseases}} and toxic shock syndrome throughout the world. However, little is known about the mechanism of emesis induced by SEs and no vaccine that prevents SE-induced emesis has been described. Methods. A nontoxic mutant SEA, SEAD 227 A, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and purified from Escherichia coli expression system. House musk shrews, a small emetic animal model, were immunized with SEAD 227 A and then challenged with wild-type SEA. SEA-induced emesis was recorded for 3 h. Antibody production was analyzed by gel double-immunodiff usion assay. Neutralizing activities of the antibodies to superantigenic and emetic activities were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Results. SEAD 227 A was devoid of both superantigenic and emetic activities, but still retained its immunological activity. Immunization with SEAD 227 A strongly induced specifi c antibody production and signifi cantly provided the protection against SEA-induced emesis. The antibodies from immunized shrews markedly inhibited the SEA-induced proliferation of spleen cells and also significantly ablated the SEA-induced vomiting in the animals. Conclusions. These results suggest that vaccination with SEAD 227 A devoid of <b>toxic</b> properties provides <b>protection</b> against SEAinduced emesis. This nontoxic mutant and its specifi c antibodies might be useful in the prevention and treatment of staphylococcal food poisonin...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of vaccines to combat pathogens that infect across mucosal surfaces {{has been a}} major goal of vaccine research. Successful mucosal vaccination requires the co-administration of adjuvants that can overcome the state of immune tolerance normally associated with mucosal application of proteins. In the case of oral immunization, delivery systems are also required to protect vaccine antigens against destruction by gastric pH and digestive enzymes. Furthermore, adjuvants used for mucosal delivery must be free of neurotoxic effects like those induced by the commonly used experimental mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin. Maintenance of the "cold chain" is also essential for the effectiveness of any vaccine and adjuvants/delivery systems that enhance the stability of a vaccine would offer a significant advantage. Needle-free methods of vaccination that induce protective immunity at multiple mucosal surfaces are also desirable for rapid vaccination of large populations. In the present study we show that transcutaneous immunization (TCI) using Lipid C, a novel lipid-based matrix originally developed for oral immunization, containing soluble Helicobacter sonicate significantly reduces the gastric bacterial burden in mice following gastric challenge with live Helicobacter pylori. Protection is associated with the production of splenic gamma interferon and gastric IgA and was achieved without the co-administration of potent and potentially <b>toxic</b> adjuvants, although <b>protection</b> was further enhanced by inclusion of CpG-ODN and cholera toxin in the lipid delivery system...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{commentary}} on current experimental and theoretical advances and frame our consideration {{in terms of the}} possible functions of MT I+II in the nervous system. Metallothioneins (MT) are a family of small cysteine rich proteins, which since their discovery in 1957 have been implicated in a range of roles including <b>toxic</b> metal detoxification, <b>protection</b> against oxidative stress, and as a metallochaperone involved in the homeostasis of both zinc and copper. The most well studied member of the family is the mammalian metallothionein, which consists of two domains: a β-domain with 9 cysteine residues and an α-domain with 11 cysteine residues. Despite over half a century of research, the exact functions of MT in the nervous system are still unknown. Our {{studies have shown that the}} distribution of MT-I+II in the brain after prolonged intoxication, inhalation of 0. 1 % CdCl 2 for 1 hour twice a week over 19 weeks, is dependent on the part of the brain. The metallothionein level declines more than 4 times in the hippocampus 3 weeks after continuous intoxication of 0. 1 % CdCl 2. The level of MT-I+II in the cerebral cortex decreased by 1. 5 times compared with the control group and did not change significantly in the cerebellum and thalamus/hypothalamus. The results of an experimental model of postoperative pain indicated that injection with MT-II prevents the development of postoperative hyperalgesia in response to mild alteration of physiological activity. Activation of locomotory and exploratory activity, and decrease of anxiety in rats under MT-II treatment at 100 µg/rat manifests itself on the 4 th day after surgery. Our experimental data indicate the multipotent function of MT I+II in the rat brain both as a metal detoxifier and as an inhibitor of postoperative pain...|$|R
40|$|A {{regulatory}} body {{such as the}} Environmental Protection Agency has responsibility to determine safe exposure levels for many chemicals. It is important that evaluation procedures incorporate measures suitable to detect {{a wide range of}} potential effects from those chemicals. Since the cost of testing each chemical is large, it is also important that test protocols be designed to produce the needed information efficiently. Many chemical agents, as well as physical agents (e. g., radiation), are capable of causing adverse effects on the reproductive systems. The reproductive systems are among the most sensitive to <b>toxic</b> insult, and <b>protection</b> of reproductive capability is of substantial concern generally. Therefore, it is important that effective methods be developed and applied for detection of reproductive effects and protection of reproductive capability. Included should be effects on the male, female (nonpregnant and pregnant), and developing young. In the regulation of chemicals for protection of humans against potential toxicity, adequate data on the effects of human exposures are seldom available. It is necessary then to use data from other species. Species used most frequently are rodents, rabbits, dogs and subhuman primates. Occasionally, data from a farm species are considered, as with ethylene dibromide (1). More important, knowledge gained from research with farm species is being applied in the design of improved protocols to detect health effects that should be considered adverse. Included are important contributions in the development of new evaluation tests, improved experimental design and in furthering understanding of reproductive biology in general. This paper addresses several testing and risk assessment issues in male reproductive toxicology that form the basis for some of our research. These issues are presented in the context of our work. Attention is focused on evaluating and improving the utility of fertility testing, quantification of sperm production rates and particularly on experimental design factors that are important in improving reliability in detecting adverse effects...|$|R
40|$|Biosurfactants are {{compounds}} that exhibit surface activity (e. g., reduce surface and interfacial tension) and {{are derived from}} natural, biological sources. They are considered green substances due to their natural derivation, biodegradability, and relatively low toxicity. Biosurfactants from multiple classes {{have been shown to}} interact with metals, and a review of these interactions is provided. Rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are attracting attention for metal remediation applications. The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate rhamnolipids' ability to complex rare earth elements, determine the environmental compatibility of novel rhamnolipid diastereomers, and assess the efficacy of rhamnolipid as a collector in ion flotation. Previous research shows rhamnolipids selectively bind elements of environmental concern over common soil and water cations, but there had been no examination of transition metals from the f-block of the periodic table. The f-block elements include the rare earth elements, which are a vital component of nearly every modern technology and subject to supply risk. The interaction between monorhamnolipids and the rare earth elements was investigated by determining conditional stability constants using a resin-based ion exchange method. For the 27 metals examined, the conditional stability constants could be divided into three groups, albeit somewhat subjectively: weakly, moderately, and strongly bound. UO 22 +, Eu 3 +, Nd 3 +, Tb 3 +, Dy 3 +, La 3 +, Cu 2 +, Al 3 +, Pb 2 +, Y 3 +, Pr 3 +, and Lu 3 +are strongly bound with conditional stability constants ranging from 9. 82 to 8. 20; Cd 2 +, In 3 +, Zn 2 +, Fe 3 +, Hg 2 +, and Ca 2 + are moderately bound with stability constants ranging from 7. 17 to 4. 10; and Sr 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, UO 22 +, Cs+, Ba 2 +, Mn 2 +, Mg 2 +, Rb+, and K+ are weakly bound with stability constants ranging from 3. 95 to 0. 96. The uranyl ion is reported twice due to the ion demonstrating two distinct binding regions. The conditional stability constants were demonstrated to be an effective predictor of metal removal order. The metal parameters of enthalpy of hydration and ionic charge to radius ratio were shown to be determinants of complexation strength. Naturally produced rhamnolipids are a mixture of congeners. Synthetic rhamnolipid synthesis has recently enabled production of four monorhamnolipid diastereomers of a single congener. The biodegradability, acute toxicity (Microtox assay), embryo toxicity (Zebrafish assay), and metal binding capacity of the diastereomers was investigated and compared to natural monorhamnolipid. Biodegradability testing showed all the diastereomers were inherently biodegradable. By the Microtox assay, all of the monorhamnolipids were categorized as slightly <b>toxic</b> by Environmental <b>Protection</b> Agency ecotoxicity categories. Out of 22 parameters tested, the zebrafish toxicity assay showed only diastereomer toxicity for the mortality parameter, except for diastereomer R,R which showed no toxic effects. All the monorhamnolipids interacted with both Cd 2 + and Pb 2 +. Ion flotation is one possible technology for metal recovery and remediation of metal contaminated waters. Ion flotation utilizes charged surfactants to collect and concentrate non-surface active ions at the surface of an aerated solution. Rhamnolipid's suitability as a collector in ion flotation was investigated. A flotation column was designed to test monorhamnolipid efficacy as a collector. Monorhamnolipids form foams and effectively remove Cs+, Cd 2 +, and La 3 + from solution. The efficacy of the flotation process relies on the collector:colligend ratio and valency of the colligend. Flotation of metal solutions showed a removal order of Cd 2 +>La 3 +>>Cs+ when the metals were present individually and mixed at equimolar concentrations. When mixed at order of magnitude different concentrations, the flotation order was Cd 2 +>>Cs+>>La 3 +. These studies show rhamnolipid has potential to be used for environmentally-compatible metal recovery and metalliferous water remediation, especially for the rare earth elements...|$|R
