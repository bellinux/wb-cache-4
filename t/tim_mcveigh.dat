5000|$|Domestic {{terrorism}} is often linked to [...] "lone wolf" [...] terrorism. Sociologist Ramón Spaaij defines lone wolf terrorism {{as an act}} of terrorism committed by one person who [...] "acts on his or her own without orders from—or even connections to an organization". During the 20th century lone wolf terrorism in the United States has been primarily associated with white supremacists and anti-government extremists in the United States such as <b>Tim</b> <b>McVeigh,</b> Ted Kaczynski, and Eric Rudolph. Many lone wolves share a common trait in that they seek acceptance from other groups but are typically met with rejection.|$|E
5000|$|The film's {{official}} website contains an expanded timeline {{of the history}} of the C.S.A., which features events not covered in the documentary. The timeline identifies President William McKinley's assassin as an abolitionist rather than Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. The C.S.A. manages to advance in space technology by smuggling Nazi scientists out of Germany before its annexation by the Soviet Union. Rosa Parks is identified as a Canadian terrorist and a member of the J.B.U.. The failed assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II occurs in New York City instead of St. Peter's Square, with the assailant being a Southern Baptist who is subsequently executed for the crime. The Gulf War has Kuwait as C.S.A. territory. In 1995, <b>Tim</b> <b>McVeigh</b> blows up the Jefferson Memorial instead of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City; his execution is broadcast on pay-per-view. The War in Afghanistan and subsequent American interventions in the Middle East are known as the [...] "1st and 2nd Crusades", with the goal of eradicating the [...] "Muslim Menace" [...] by overthrowing the Islamic governments, taking over their oil production, and converting their entire populace to Christianity.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis will scrutinize {{the histories of}} our nation's three most prolific domestic lone wolf terrorists: <b>Tim</b> <b>McVeigh,</b> Ted Kaczynski, and Eric Rudolph. It will establish a chronological pattern to their radicalization and reveal that their communal ideological beliefs, psychology, attributes, traits, and training take place along a common chronological timeline. Their pattern of radicalization {{can be used as}} an indicator of lone wolf terrorist radicalization development in future cases. This thesis establishes a strikingly similar chronological pattern of radicalization that was present in each terrorist's biography. This pattern can identify future lone wolf terrorist radicalization activity upstream. It can provide a valuable portent to apply in the analysis of potential lone terrorists, potentially enabling law enforcement to prevent tragedies emerging from the identified population through psychological assistance, evaluation, training, or, in the worst case, detention.

40|$|In {{the preface}} to this new edited volume, Elizabeth Cook-Lynn notes that while she learned {{to read and write}} English as a small child growing up on South Dakota 2 ̆ 7 s Crow Creek reservation, it took 2 ̆ 2 many decades 2 ̆ 2 for her to learn to use the {{language}} 2 ̆ 2 efficiently. 2 ̆ 2 She writes, 2 ̆ 2 I published nothing until I was forty. 2 ̆ 2 That would have been 1970, barely two years into what has become known as the Native American Literary Renaissance. The Dakota writer and scholar certainly made up for lost time. In the ensuing decades, she has produced a formidable corpus of work, both in terms of quantity and variety. One of the founding figures of Native American Studies, she has published novels, literary riticism, and essay collections {{on a wide range of}} topics related to the indigenes of the hemisphere. She is one of Native America 2 ̆ 7 s best poets. Now well into her seventies, her pace seems quickening rather than abating. Volumes like Why I Can 2 ̆ 7 t Read Wallace Stegner (1996) and Anti-Indianism in America (2001) mark her as one of the most important and consistent indigenous scholarly voices working today. This current collection (a quick followup to New Indians, Old Wars [2007]) is a bit of a grab bag, as one would expect when a writer 2 ̆ 2 clears 2 ̆ 2 his or her notebooks. There are poems here, ranging from the touching and lovely to the stilettopointed. Cook-Lynn is never one to shirk from freighted issues, as her poems 2 ̆ 2 Who Owns the Past? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Who Are You, <b>Tim</b> <b>McVeigh?</b> 2 ̆ 2 remind us. The prose ranges from longer essays like 2 ̆ 2 Whatever Happened to D 2 ̆ 7 Arcy McNickle? 2 ̆ 2 (a critique of fiction by Louise Erdrich and the late James Welch) and 2 ̆ 2 Irony 2 ̆ 7 s Blade 2 ̆ 2 (a meditation on the use of that particular tool in art and scholarship) to very brief thoughts or reflections. Yet even the briefest of Cook-Lynn 2 ̆ 7 s pieces can inform, surprise, or delight. Her single paragraph analysis of the Leonard Peltier case (2 ̆ 2 Great Literary Events 2 ̆ 2) is the most honest and accurate statement about that tawdry affair and its continuing consequences I have seen in print in years...|$|E
