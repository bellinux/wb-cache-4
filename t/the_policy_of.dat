5|$|After the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), {{the navy}} {{was used to}} hijack Swedish ships in the Baltic Sea, and in 1680, six Brandenburg-Prussian vessels {{captured}} the Spanish vessel Carolus Secundus near Oostende to pressure Spain to pay promised subsidies. The Spanish ship was renamed Markgraf von Brandenburg ("Margrave of Brandenburg") and became the flagship of an Atlantic fleet that was ordered to capture Spanish vessels carrying silver; it was not successful in this mission. In the following years, the navy was expanded, and <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> leasing ships was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> building or purchasing them. On 1 October 1684 Frederick William bought all ships that had been leased for 110,000 talers. Also in 1684, the East Frisian port of Emden replaced Pillau as the main Brandenburg-Prussian naval base. From Pillau, part of the shipyard, the admiral's house and the wooden church of the employees was transferred to Emden. While Emden {{was not part of}} Brandenburg-Prussia, the elector owned a nearby castle, Greetsiel, and negotiated an agreement with the town to maintain a garrison and a port.|$|E

Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E
