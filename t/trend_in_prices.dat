5000|$|The wedge {{pattern is}} a {{commonly}} found {{pattern in the}} price charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc.). The pattern {{is characterized by a}} contracting range in prices coupled with an upward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> (known as a rising wedge) or a downward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> (known as a falling wedge). [...] __FORCETOC__A wedge pattern {{is considered to be a}} pattern which is forming at the top or bottom of the trend. It is a type of formation in which trading activities are confined within converging straight lines which form a pattern. It should take about 3 to 4 weeks to complete the wedge. This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction. It differs from the triangle in the sense that both boundary lines either slope up or down. Price breaking out point creates another difference from the triangle. Falling and rising wedges are a small part of intermediate or major trend. As they are reserved for minor trends, they are not considered to be major patterns. Once that basic or primary trend resumes itself, the wedge pattern loses its effectiveness as a technical indicator.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} and test a {{heterogeneous}} agent {{model for the}} oil market. The demand for oil is divided in a speculative component and a real component. Speculators are boundedly rational in forming price expectations. Expectations are formed by one of two boundedly rational rules of thumb: fundamentalist and chartist. While fundamentalists trade on mean-reversion, chartists follow the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices.</b> Speculators then choose between these rules based on past profitability. Estimation results on Brent and WTI oil reveal that both groups are active in the oil market, and that speculators often switch between the groups.

30|$|To {{develop a}} ROA {{framework}} of energy investment decision, this study made several simplifying assumptions leading to various limitations in the analyses. First, the coal prices {{are assumed to}} be stochastic and follow GBM. With the positive drift of coal prices from the ADF unit root test, this assumes that the prices are increasing in the long run. With coal being an exhaustible resource, the current demand path and competition may accelerate the upward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> with higher volatility and uncertainty. On the other hand, this paper acknowledges that the rapid developments in renewable technologies may eventually reduce the demand for coal and its price. This trend in coal price and demand should be accounted for. Moreover, different models to describe stochastic prices of fossil fuels could also be used for further comparison of results using GBM.|$|E

40|$|This paper econometrically {{examines}} the factors determining {{the real estate}} price dynamics in Chile in the period 1990 - 2007. For such purpose, we use annual data of 419 homes located in the Metropolitan Area and acquired in that period. The results indicate that variables such as age and size are statistically significant determinants {{in the formation of}} property prices; access to the subway stations tends to capitalize in a non-linear manner; and both household income and aggregate income are statistically and economically significant. The price decomposition reveals that between 69 % and 71 % of the housing price level is explained by determinants related to attributes of the property, while about 70 % of the observed growth in housing prices between 1990 and 2007 is the result of macro-financial determinants. During 2006 and 2007, the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> is not significantly different from that predicted by the model.

40|$|We use {{data from}} California to {{document}} and offer {{possible explanations for}} the sharp increase in hospital prices charged to private payers after 1999. We find a downward trend in price for private pay patients in the 1990 s and a rapid upward trend beginning in 1999, amounting to an annual average increase of 10. 6 % per year over 1999 - 2005. Prices in 2006 were almost double prices in 1999. By contrast, there was little discernable <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> for Medicare and Medicaid patients, although these prices varied from year-to-year. Surprisingly, the increase in prices is not correlated, geographically, with the change in hospital market concentration. For example, the greatest price rises came from hospitals in monopoly and highly concentrated counties which experienced little or no change over our sample period. Two recent California state hospital regulations, the seismic retrofit mandate and the mandatory nurse staffing ratio affected hospital costs. However, the cost increases due to the nursing staffing regulations are not large enough {{to account for the}} price increase, and the price increase is not substantially correlated with the costs of compliance with the seismic retrofit mandate. Therefore, the source of the near-doubling of California hospital prices remains something of a mystery. ...|$|E
