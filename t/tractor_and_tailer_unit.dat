40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to collect and analyse current data related to repair and {{maintenance}} costs of <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines. Specific objectives of this study were: (a) to collect current repair cost data for <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines; (b) to compare these data with yearly repair cost estimates derived from ASAE repair cost formulas; (c) to estimate expected tractor life; (d) to estimate expected combine life; (e) to study the factors affecting repair costs of <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines; (f) to develop appropriate new repair cost equations for <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines;Two questionnaire surveys were conducted by the author to collect current repair cost data for <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines from a sample of Iowa farmers who owned these machines in 1984 and 1985. Factors affecting repair and maintenance costs of <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines included make and model, age, annual use, and farm size. The results showed that there were no effects of <b>tractor</b> <b>and</b> combine make on repair and maintenance costs. The relationships between repair costs and age were highly significant. Also, the greatest single factor affecting hourly <b>tractor</b> <b>and</b> combine repair costs was the annual use;Testing the validity of the ASAE formulas for predicting repair costs indicated that these formulas, except for one equation, do not accurately predict yearly repair and maintenance costs for Central Iowa <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines. The data show that the average tractor life estimated by the farmers was 8355 hours, and it was 3575 hours for combines. Using the STEPWISE regression procedure to fit the best model for predicting yearly repair costs for <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> combines leads to the following two equations: For wheel tractor: Y =. 072 TAH +. 0096 P +. 66 H + 78. For self-propelled combine: Y = 241. 70 N +. 016 P + 2. 27 H + 1. 07 A - 1894. 9. Where: Y = Repair and maintenance costs (/year); TAH = Total accumulated hours of use, at end of year (hrs); P = Purchase price (); H = Annual hours of use (hrs); N = Age of the combine (yrs); A = Annual harvested acres (acres) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{decision}} support software (DSS) {{was developed in}} Visual Basic 6. 0 programming language for matching and selecting implements with <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> time management of farm operations. The proper selection <b>and</b> matching of <b>tractor</b> <b>and</b> implements is now become very important and difficult in Iran because of availability of variety of <b>tractor</b> models <b>and</b> powers ranging from 5. 5 to 60 kW and variety of implement sizes. The {{purpose of this study}} was development software for mechanized operation and its application in paddy’s farms. The developed DSS was tested with a case study to demonstrate the flexibility of the software. This software has databases including variety of <b>tractor</b> models <b>and</b> implements sizes, existing data from five climatology stations from 1990 to 2010, <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> implements performance and soil and operation conditions for the zone of this study. <b>Tractors</b> <b>and</b> implements were selected and matched for paddy fields by developed DSS. Finally, tillage operation in paddy fields was managed with selected <b>tractors</b> <b>and</b> implements. Use of DSS in this study indicated that tractors with power less than 35 kW are able to complete the tillage operations (plowing, harrowing and puddling) for paddy fields lower than 40 hectares. Also, results indicate that energy consumption for tillage operation on paddy’s farms in case study was 17. 36 percentages less than other paddies...|$|R
