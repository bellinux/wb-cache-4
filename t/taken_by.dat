5|$|A hat-trick in cricket {{is when a}} bowler {{takes three}} wickets on {{consecutive}} deliveries, dismissing three different batsmen. It is a relatively rare event in One Day International (ODI) cricket with only 43 occurrences in more than 3,800 matches since the first ODI, between Australia and England on 5 January 1971. The first ODI hat-trick was <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> Jalal-ud-Din of Pakistan, playing against Australia in Hyderabad, Sindh in September 1982 and the first world cup hat trick was <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> Chetan Sharma of India against New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{the school}} follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 {{and offers a}} range of GCSEs (national exams <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> pupils aged 14–16) and A-Levels (national exams <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> pupils aged 16–18). The school has no {{affiliation}} with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and pupils may opt to take the subject {{as part of their}} GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational; in some cases, local clergy attend as guest speakers. Pupils participate in a number of educational visits throughout their school career and Year 10 pupils are offered the opportunity to participate in a work experience programme, which usually lasts for two weeks.|$|E
