5|$|Every Christmas, Oxford Street is {{decorated}} with festive lights. The tradition of Christmas lights began in 1959, {{five years after the}} neighbouring Regent Street. There were no light displays in 1976 or 1977 due to economic recession, but the lights returned in 1978 when Oxford Street organised a laser display, and they have been <b>there</b> <b>every</b> year since.|$|E
5|$|In 1819 Cardiff Cricket Club was formed, by 1848 {{they had}} moved to their new home at the Arms Park. Glamorgan Cricket Club, at the time not a {{first-class}} county, played their first match at Cardiff Arms Park in June 1869, against Monmouthshire Cricket Club. They played their first-ever County Championship match there in 1921, competing <b>there</b> <b>every</b> season (except while first-class cricket was suspended during the Second World War), their last match being against Somerset County Cricket Club in August 1966. Cardiff Cricket Club played their final game at the ground against Lydney Cricket Club on 17 September 1966. Both Cardiff Cricket Club and Glamorgan then {{moved to a new}} ground at Sophia Gardens on the opposite bank of the River Taff to the Arms Park, following work on the creation of a national rugby stadium, later named the National Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the next}} years, Lafayette made his house, the Hôtel de La Fayette in Paris's rue de Bourbon, the {{headquarters}} of Americans there. Benjamin Franklin, John and Sarah Jay, and John and Abigail Adams met <b>there</b> <b>every</b> Monday, and dined in company with Lafayette's family and the liberal nobility, including Clermont-Tonnerre and Madame de Staël. Lafayette continued to work on lowering trade barriers in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and his successor as envoy, Jefferson, in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to eliminate the injustices that Protestants in France had endured since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes a century before.|$|E
5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass <b>there</b> <b>every</b> Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E

25|$|During {{the advance}} from {{southern}} Palestine {{the system of}} leave to the Australian Mounted Division's Rest Camp at Port Said was stopped. It started again in January 1918, and throughout the occupation of the Jordan Valley quotas averaging about 350 men were sent <b>there</b> <b>every</b> ten days. This gave the men seven days clear rest, in very good conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{characterization}} of cographs by the property that every clique and maximal independent set have a nonempty intersection is a stronger {{version of the}} defining property of strongly perfect graphs, in which <b>there</b> <b>every</b> induced subgraph contains an independent set that intersects all maximal cliques. In a cograph, every maximal independent set intersects all maximal cliques. Thus, every cograph is strongly perfect.|$|E

25|$|Brest’s {{history has}} always {{been linked to the}} sea: the Académie de Marine (Naval Academy) was founded in 1752 in this city.

25|$|Another unique {{offering}} is {{the annual}} Winter Camp held <b>there</b> <b>every</b> winter from December 27 to 31.

25|$|The Pennsylvania Farm Show, {{the largest}} free indoor {{agriculture}} exposition in the United States, was first held in Harrisburg in 1917 {{and has been}} held <b>there</b> <b>every</b> early-to-mid January since then. Harrisburg also hosts an annual outdoor sports show, the largest {{of its kind in}} North America, an auto show, which features a large static display of new as well as classic cars and is renowned nationwide, and Motorama, a two-day event consisting of a car show, motocross racing, remote control car racing, and more.

25|$|Most {{shows in}} the first 30 years were {{recorded}} in the Paris Theatre in central London. In 1992, the then-new producer, Sarah Smith, took the show outside central London and recorded some shows in nearby Highgate.

The show started going to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1993 and has been <b>there</b> <b>every</b> year since. Currently most shows, though not all, are recorded at the BBC Radio Theatre in Broadcasting House in central London.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} story of Chang'e (Vietnamese: Hằng Nga), {{there are two other}} popular folktales {{associated}} with the festival. The first describes the legend of Cuội, whose wife accidentally urinated on a sacred banyan tree. The tree began to float towards the moon, and Cuội, trying to pull it back down to earth, floated to the moon with it, leaving him stranded <b>there.</b> <b>Every</b> year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, children light lanterns and participate in a procession to show Cuội the way back to Earth. The other tale involves a carp who wanted to become a dragon, and as a result, worked hard throughout the year until he was able to transform himself into a dragon.|$|E
