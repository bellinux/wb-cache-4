5|$|Work on {{the second}} bridge {{commenced}} on 8 June 1965, increasing {{the height and width}} in accordance with Ministry of <b>Transport</b> <b>requirements.</b> Around this time, the station itself was upgraded: the platforms were demolished and replaced, and new waiting shelters were erected. A new booking office, facing Station Road and approached by a flight of stairs, was built alongside a new booking lobby, toilets and staff accommodation. New entrances to the platforms were built, and the entire station was installed with electric lighting. Station Road was significantly widened and rerouted slightly in 1967 in a further attempt to accommodate increasing traffic.|$|E
5|$|Transport {{links between}} Rijeka and Zagreb {{have always been}} of {{substantial}} importance because of the <b>transport</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Port of Rijeka. This was first recognised by the Habsburg Empire in 1728, when the Carolina road was completed, and again in 1780 when the road was modernized. The original RijekaZagreb road was replaced in 1811 by a new route, the Louisiana road, {{in order to avoid}} the steep sections of its predecessor. The new road remained the primary transport link to Rijeka until 1873, when the first railroad to the city was built. Further development of the port and industry in Rijeka and Zagreb required a more efficient road, which was built in 1954. That road was to remain the principal road transport link between the two cities for decades.|$|E
5|$|Nhill {{was always}} {{meant to be}} a {{temporary}} location for No.1 OTU, whose home was to be East Sale, also in Victoria. As accommodation at East Sale would not be available until October 1942, the school's 1,630 personnel were relocated to Bairnsdale in June and July. The base's living quarters, recreational buildings and 88 tents could not fully accommodate this influx, so the RAAF rented hotels in Bairnsdale for 320 airmen. On 10December 1942, No.1 OTU Detached Flight, consisting of 15 Hudsons and 108 personnel including air and maintenance crews, was sent to North-Eastern Area Command to help fulfill urgent <b>transport</b> <b>requirements</b> in New Guinea. This force joined a military Douglas DC-2 and eleven civil aircraft pressed into service to form RAAF Special Transport Flight, which operated out of Wards Airfield from 14December 1942 to 11January 1943. The Hudsons flew 645 sorties, carrying some 1,100 troops and almost 800 tons of equipment. Two of the Hudsons were lost, one to enemy action and one to friendly fire, and several were damaged.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the United States Army began forming {{requirements}} for a helicopter {{to replace the}} UH-1 Iroquois, and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS). The Army also initiated {{the development of a}} new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the General Electric T700. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant. The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972. The RFP also included air <b>transport</b> <b>requirements.</b> Transport aboard the C-130 limited the UTTAS cabin height and length.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} opening ceremony {{was held on}} 14 October 1963 and presided over by the mayor of Lyttelton, Mr. J. B. Collett. Various other dignitaries and invited guests were present, including the Minister of Railways, John McAlpine (who officially opened the station), the local member for parliament, Norman Kirk, and the Railways general manager, Mr. A. T. Gandell. An invitation to attend was also extended {{to members of the}} public. During his speech, the mayor expressed his confidence that, despite the impending completion of the Lyttelton road tunnel, and the desire expressed by the Christchurch Transport Board to operate bus services to Lyttelton, both road and rail could coexist to meet Lyttelton's <b>transport</b> <b>requirements.</b> Two buses were provided to convey official guests to the Borough Council Chambers for morning tea.|$|E
25|$|In January 1935, Bressey {{was given}} a knighthood, and, Minister of Transport Leslie Hore-Belisha, {{appointed}} him to prepare a report on London's future road <b>transport</b> <b>requirements</b> up to the mid-1960s. Bressey spent three years consulting with experts and interested parties and investigating European plans. He was assisted by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The final report, The Highway Development Survey, 1937 for Greater London, was published on 16 May 1938 and proposed a series of high capacity motorways radiating outwards {{from the city and}} made recommendations for a series of circular routes around the capital. Although World War II delayed the implementation of any of Bressey's and Lutyens' recommendations, they subsequently featured in a number of post war reports such as Sir Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan and the Greater London Council's 1960s London Ringways scheme.|$|E
50|$|The {{numbers of}} Austauschbauart wagons never {{approached}} {{those of the}} DSV wagons because, to begin with, the worldwide economic crisis caused {{a reduction in the}} demand for transportation. Only with the start of the Second World War did the <b>transport</b> <b>requirement</b> rise again. As a result, the Oppeln (from 1937) and Stuttgart (from 1938) classes quickly became the most numerous Austauschbauart wagons built by far.|$|R

25|$|In 1908 {{construction}} {{began on}} the canal. Under the plan, coal-mining companies contributed one-third of the construction cost and by 1914 this amounted to 23 million francs of the total 72 million francs in incurred expenses. Three quarters of the excavations, 11 locks {{and all of the}} bridges were complete, with work well advanced on the tunnels, when World War I forced a halt in construction. The war resulted in widespread destruction of the canal and the French government did not attempt to resume building until after World War II, when the rapid economic growth experienced by France in the 1950s saw a marked increase in bulk <b>transport</b> <b>requirements</b> between the Seine basin and the north, and it again became urgent to complete the project. The works were carried out in the early 1960s and the canal opened to navigation in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Late 2008, at a forum {{investigating}} the Doncaster rail line, which involved the Yarra, Melbourne and Manningham city councils, {{it was noted}} that 41% of Manningham residents are classified as low-income earners (despite the eastern suburb affluence stereotype), this is higher than the city average. The discrepancy is suspected to be caused by the increased reliance on private automobiles to meet day to day <b>transport</b> <b>requirements</b> residents face {{due to the lack of}} alternative methods of transportation such as Tram-Trains. At this forum, Peter Newman noted the similarities between the Doncaster line and the Mandurah line and suggested that it was the only viable option for both the short and long term transportation needs of the area. Other recommendations included the creation of transport corridors to aid in the transition of the existing urban environment towards Transit oriented development.|$|E
25|$|Support Branch is sub-divided {{into five}} divisions. Field Division is {{responsible}} for coordinating policy matters relating to firearms, equipment, uniforms and operational procedures. Projects undertaken by the Division during the year included the force-wide introduction of the OC Foam and the new, expandable baton. It had also been instrumental in developing technological solutions {{to a number of}} policing problems and is currently conducting a review of police uniforms including the cap and the shoes as well as other accoutrements. General Division handles policy matters relating to station procedures; the security and management of the Police Headquarters (PHQ) complex; and diverse other duties. During the year, the Division {{played a major role in}} the streamlining of station procedures; making arrangements for the reallocation of offices and facilities; formulating a new policy for parking at the PHQ as required by the PHQ Redevelopment Project and such other duties as coordinating the Force involvement in the District Council elections. Transport Division {{is responsible for}} the management and deployment of the Force fleet of approximately 2,400 vehicles, driver establishment and the acquisition of new police vehicles. It also administers all policy matters relating to police <b>transport</b> <b>requirements.</b> Force Data and Access to Information Coordination Unit is responsible for coordinating the Force response to devising internal policy on and ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and the Code on Access to Information.

500|$|The Dakotas were {{tasked with}} airlifting cargo, VIPs, troops and casualties, {{as well as}} courier flights, supply drops to {{friendly}} forces and aerial despatch of propaganda leaflets. On other missions they acted as pathfinders for No.1 Squadron, dropping smoke canisters on suspected communist hideouts that the Lincolns flying above and behind would attempt to bomb. [...] Airlifting and supplying troops was {{a key part of}} the strategy to defeat the insurgency, by ensuring that security forces could maintain a semi-permanent presence in the jungle. No.38 Squadron's operations ranged throughout Malaya and into Borneo, the Philippines, Japan and Korea. <b>Transport</b> <b>requirements</b> in the Korean War led to a reduction in No.90 Wing's strength when four of the Dakotas were transferred to Iwakuni, Japan, headquarters of No.91 (Composite) Wing, in November 1950. [...] The same month, Group Captain Frank Headlam was appointed to take over command of No.90 Wing from Heffernan. Headlam co-piloted a Dakota on a supply drop on 20December; he was slightly injured and the aircraft badly damaged following a crash-landing at Kampong Aur in Pahang as a result of engine failure.|$|E
2500|$|A {{need for}} new {{transport}} aircraft for the Royal Netherlands Air Force (Koninklijke Luchtmacht) was first identified in 1984. The 1991 Gulf War highlighted the deficiencies in mobility of European forces. [...] In 1991 four categories of <b>transport</b> <b>requirements</b> were established. Category A required a large cargo aircraft {{with a range of}} at least 4,500km and the capability to refuel F-16s. In 1992, two DC-10-30CFs were acquired from Martinair in a buy/leaseback contract. When one of the two aircraft was lost in the Martinair Flight 495 crash, a third aircraft was bought from Martinair.|$|E

30|$|The {{energy stored}} in EV {{batteries}} is normally used for powering the vehicle, {{but it could}} also be fed back into the grid when electricity prices are high to potentially make some profit for the EV owner if they are rewarded from the grid for the service. The concept of injecting power back into the grid from EV batteries is known as vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) [3]. Automobiles are on average parked 96 % of the time which increases the chance of them being available and connected for V 2 G operation [4]. Therefore, by using smart controllers, these vehicles could be charged when the price of electricity is low and give some energy back to the grid when the price of electricity is high if their stored energy is higher than the immediate <b>transport</b> <b>requirement</b> of the vehicle owner.|$|R
