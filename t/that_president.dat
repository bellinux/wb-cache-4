40|$|Examining {{communication}} {{items from}} four <b>presidents,</b> we find <b>that</b> <b>presidents</b> link {{themselves to the}} party system rhetorically. Employment of party references is tested against recurrent features {{of the office and}} shifts in the political environment, including presidential approval, partisan independence, presidential successes and defeats in Congress, and the presence of divided government. Presidents strategically employ party system references with regard to audience and calendar. We find greater support for the rhetorical president as politician rather than as statesman above the fray, and we consider our findings in relation to the concept of political time. These findings suggest rethinking accounts of the contemporary presidency <b>that</b> presume <b>that</b> <b>presidents</b> determinedly place themselves “above politics ” and “beyond party ” when crafting their communications imagery. The relationship between the president and political parties has generated signifi-cant scholarly controversy. Prominent proponents of responsible political parties have argued <b>that</b> <b>presidents</b> provide critically important party leadership (Burns 1963; Schattschneider 1942).

40|$|Scholars {{have argued}} <b>that</b> U. S. <b>presidents</b> use their {{judicial}} appointments {{to advance their}} political goals.

This study will examine the factors that affect the probability of a cross-party judicial nomination occurring, in order to better understand the goals <b>that</b> <b>presidents</b> are seeking to advance through these unusual actions. Looking at nominations to United States federal circuit courts and district courts between 1977 through 2004, the study finds that, controlling for a number of relevant factors, a greater number of opposition senators from a state and a higher level of electoral competition between the Republican and Democratic parties in a state increase the probability <b>that</b> a <b>president</b> will name someone from outside of his party from that state to a federal court vacancy. The findings support the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>presidents</b> make cross-party judicial nominations to further their partisan electoral objectives, and as a response to institutional pressure from opposition senators through the use of Senate rules...|$|R

He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E

Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president after the Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>President</b> Joseph Estrada resigned. Arroyo appointed Teofisto Guingona days after she ascended to power.
