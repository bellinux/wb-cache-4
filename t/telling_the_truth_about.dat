Romero Barceló {{admitted}} in a public radio interview that it was “an error of judgment” and “a premature declaration” to laud the police officers, since at that time he believed they were <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> their self-defense. However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations.|$|E

The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is not <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E

A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists to his family and Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did this to him. Initially Krystal is the only one to believe JR, but Babe later finds out that JR is <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> Richie and apologizes to him.

500|$|Dilling's {{political}} activism was {{spurred by the}} [...] "bitter opposition" [...] she encountered upon her return to Illinois in 1931, [...] "against my <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> Russia... from suburbanite 'intellectual' friends and from my own Episcopal minister." [...] She began public speaking as a hobby, following her doctor's advice. Iris McCord, a Chicago radio broadcaster who taught at the Moody Bible Institute, arranged for her to address local church groups. Within a year Dilling was touring the Midwest, the Northeast and occasionally the West Coast, accompanied by her husband. She showed her home movies of the Soviet Union and made the same speech {{several times a week}} to audiences sometimes as large as several hundred, hosted by organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the American Legion.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien commended {{the usage}} of {{electronic}} sounds and bleeps in the track {{as well as the}} [...] "bell like clarity" [...] in Madonna's vocals, a result of the training she had received from her Evita days. Kenneth Bielen, author of The Lyrics of Civility declared the record as a [...] "slice of Madonna's autobiography", praising the lyrics for forecasting what the singer's life could become. Allen Metz wrote in the book, The Madonna Companion, that the lyrics did not give an impression of [...] "sophisticated wordplay", but was commendable for <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> Madonna's life and career. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic labelled the song as a [...] "swirling" [...] and [...] "meditative opener". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly described the track, along with [...] "Frozen" [...] from the album, as [...] "breathtaking", complimenting its beats. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine found Madonna's belting to be the most [...] "emotionally candid" [...] she has been since her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer (1989).|$|E
500|$|Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press {{believes}} Ellis' {{version of}} events that day, {{although he did not}} witness the game in person. Smizik was the reporter who first broke the story in 1984. Bill Christine, also of the Pittsburgh Press, does not believe Ellis' claim and was at the game that day. Christine was a beat reporter who [...] "practically lived with the team that year". Christine said that he did not notice anything unusual, and says that if Ellis had reported to the stadium only 90 minutes before his scheduled start, reporters would have been told. John Mehno, a reporter who had [...] "extensive interactions" [...] with Ellis over his career, was skeptical about many stories told by Ellis, including the LSD no-hitter. Mehno said that he has not found a teammate who would corroborate the story. However, one of his close friends, Scipio Spinks, a pitcher for the Astros, has said he has no doubt Ellis was <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> his LSD use as he was very familiar with Dock's drug habits, including the use of LSD.|$|E

500|$|The {{affidavit}} {{filed by}} authorities supporting the arrest warrant for Ward showed that investigators had concluded {{the men were}} not <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> what happened. The report states [...] "The evidence demonstrates that Robert Wone was restrained, incapacitated, sexually assaulted, and murdered inside 1509 Swann Street," [...] and there exists [...] "overwhelming evidence, far in excess of probable cause" [...] that Price, Zaborsky, and Ward [...] "obstructed justice by altering and orchestrating the crime scene, planting evidence, delaying the reporting of the murder to the authorities, and lying to the police about the true circumstances of the murder." [...] Lawyers for the three accused men have called the affidavit [...] "speculation, innuendo, assumptions, and irrelevant inflammatory comments" [...] and maintain their clients' innocence. Price and Zaborsky were domestic partners, and the affidavit alleges that Price had previously had {{a sexual relationship with}} Ward. Washington attorney Dale Sanders opined that the release of the extensively detailed affidavit was intended to turn one of the housemates, presumably Ward, against the others, and hypothesized that it indicated prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to charge any of the housemates with additional crimes without the cooperation of a witness.|$|E

2500|$|Yon {{has been}} quoted by Fox News, by Newsmax, and by Times Online.

Barone {{has referred to}} Yon's work in his column. Oliver North has supported Yon's reporting, and John Gibson cited Yon in an editorial. New York University professor Jay Rosen has named Yon's writing as a prominent example of successful citizen journalism. Bruce Willis has stated his intention to produce a movie about Deuce Four's deployment in Iraq, to be largely based on Yon's experiences with the unit.

2500|$|The {{first trial}} of {{defendants}} McGeehan, Carroll, Duffy, James Boyle, and James Roarity {{for the killing}} of Yost commenced in May 1876. Yost had not recognized the men who attacked him. Although Kerrigan has since been described, along with Duffy, as hating the night watchman enough to plot his murder, Kerrigan became a state's witness and testified against the union leaders and other miners. However, Kerrigan's wife testified in the courtroom {{that her husband had}} committed the murder. She testified that she refused to provide her husband with clothing while he was in prison, because he had [...] "picked innocent men to suffer for his crime". She stated that she was speaking out voluntarily, and was only interested in <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> the murder. Gowen cross-examined her, but could not shake her testimony. Others supported her testimony amid speculation that Kerrigan was receiving special treatment {{due to the fact that}} McParland was engaged to his sister-in-law, Mary Ann Higgins. This trial was declared a mistrial due to the death of one of the jurors. A new trial was granted two months later. During that trial Fanny Kerrigan did not testify. The five defendants were sentenced to death. Kerrigan was allowed to go free.|$|E
