5|$|Early World Cups {{were given}} to {{countries}} at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was {{met with}} some resistance.

To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> have Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{national}} survey of U.

The effects of these three decisions on farm household income are also examined. By estimating a heteroscedastic household income function, we identify the effects of participating in these activities on the average level of farm household income and its variation within each sub-group of farms involved in the several combinations of activities. Our empirical results support the hypothesis that participation in <b>the</b> CRP and <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> work off <b>the</b> farm by the operator and the spouse are made jointly rather than independently. <b>The</b> operators' <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> work off <b>the</b> farm and to participate in CRP increase the mean level of the household income, while <b>the</b> spouses' <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> work off <b>the</b> farm help decrease the variation in household income among households in that sub-group.
