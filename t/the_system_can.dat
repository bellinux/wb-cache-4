5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on {{the system as a}} whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> destabilize the society.|$|E

5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries of the system. However, for cellular automata this theorem {{does not directly}} apply, because instead of being governed by {{the energy of the}} system the behavior of the automaton is encoded into its rules, and the automaton is guaranteed to obey certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might obey. Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy in some respects. For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for the energy of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E
5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and the stage is set for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning {{takes place}} before {{the first two games}} in the series. The player {{controls}} the Blue tribe, pitted against the three enemy tribes which control most of the solar system. The player's destiny as Shaman is to become a deity; only by defeating all the enemies in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> the player's shaman become omnipotent. The player begins on the planet furthest from the sun, and attacks each planet in sequence. Along the way, the Shaman can learn new skills and magic to defeat her (usually) much more powerful enemies. Victory requires the player to either destroy the opposition, or on occasion perform special actions. The player loses if his or her Shaman is killed and there are no remaining followers, if the Shaman is killed and there is no circle of reincarnation, or the player runs out of time on timed levels. Upon beating back the other tribes, the Shaman ascends to godhood, and further helps her people conquer the Matak, Chumara and Dakini in one final conflict.|$|E
40|$|An {{adaptive}} control <b>system</b> is disclosed. <b>The</b> control <b>system</b> <b>can</b> control uncertain dynamic <b>systems.</b> <b>The</b> control <b>system</b> <b>can</b> employ {{one or more}} derivative-free {{adaptive control}} architectures. <b>The</b> control <b>system</b> <b>can</b> further employ one or more derivative-free weight update laws.

5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced to}} a {{tropical}} depression roughly midway between the Lesser Antilles and {{the west coast of}} Africa at 1800 UTC on September 7. Though initially believed to have developed on September 11, the disturbance was found to have formed earlier in post-season reanalysis, based on data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. In its early developmental stages, the disturbance remained a tropical depression with little change in intensity. At 0600UTC on September10, it intensified into a tropical storm while still east of the Lesser Antilles. Closer to the islands, ships reported a quickly intensifying tropical cyclone with low barometric pressures, strong winds and heavy thunderstorms, although most of the activity occurred to the east of its center.|$|E

A service tunnel under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles and the visiting team's coach to enter the stadium directly. Once inside the stadium patrons have access to six themed restaurants, two of which have views of the pitch, and there are 70 executive boxes above the second tier of seating in the north, west and east stands.

5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E
