5|$|At Unionville, M-25 turns more {{westerly}} {{to round}} {{the bottom of}} Saginaw Bay into Bay City along Bay City-Forestville Road in Tuscola County. In the community of Quanicassee, it transitions to Center Road and crosses into Bay County. M-25 is routed <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> street pair of 7th Street and McKinley Street before crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Saginaw River.

5|$|At this point, DE 4 turns {{north for}} a {{concurrency}} with DE 7 on the six-lane divided Stanton Christiana Road, running through wooded areas with nearby development, including the Hale-Byrnes House, and passing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad {{line and the}} White Clay Creek and Mill Creek near their confluence. The road passes {{to the east of}} Delaware Park Racetrack and curves northeast into Stanton. At this point, the two routes head into a commercial area and split into <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair of Mitch Road eastbound and Main Street westbound. DE 7 splits from DE 4 by heading northwest on Limestone Road. DE 4 continues east along <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair past homes and businesses with two lanes in each direction, crossing Red Clay Creek. The directions of the route rejoin and the route becomes four-lane divided West Newport Pike, heading through suburban areas and crossing Hershey Run. DE 4 enters Newport and splits into <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair of West Market Street eastbound and West Justis Street westbound.

5|$|On December 12, 1962, the I-96 freeway was {{completed}} around {{the south and}} west sides of Lansing, and a year later, the I-496 freeway {{was completed}} north into downtown from I-96. M-78 was rerouted from the I-96/US27 interchange southwest of Lansing east along I-96 and then north on I-496. From there, M-78 followed <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pairing of Homer and Howard streets from the northern end of the freeway up to <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> couplet of Saginaw Street and Grand River Avenue, returning to its previous routing.

5|$|After DE 9A, DE 9 enters Wilmington {{and heads}} through urban areas as an {{undivided}} road, crossing Norfolk Southern's Shellpot Secondary before intersecting the northbound direction of US 13. At this point, DE 9 splits into a one-way pair with the northbound direction becoming concurrent with northbound US 13 on one-way New Castle Avenue and the southbound direction following southbound US 13 on South Heald Street, briefly turning east along with northbound US 13 on D Street {{at the south}} end of <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair. <b>The</b> <b>one-way</b> pair, which carries two lanes in each direction, passes rowhomes and businesses, with New Castle Avenue merging onto South Heald Street.

5|$|After this, SR75 {{passes through}} the United States Naval Amphibious Base for a few miles before {{entering}} downtown Coronado.

5|$|The two {{directions}} of DE 4 rejoin and the route continues northeast as four-lane undivided East Newport Pike.The road leaves Newport and heads between suburban neighborhoods {{to the northwest}} and Banning Park to the southeast.

The road comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of DE 100 before crossing CSX's Market Street Industrial Track railroad line. DE 4 continues into Wilmington and passes rowhomes and businesses. The route passes under I-95/US 202 and comes to a ramp from northbound I-95/US 202. Past this, DE 4 enters downtown Wilmington and splits into <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair of Maryland Avenue eastbound and South Monroe Street westbound before ending at DE 48, which is routed on <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard eastbound and West Second Street westbound.|$|E

Along this one-way pair, the route carries one lane {{in each direction}} {{with the exception of}} Light Street, where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light Street and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits into another one-way pair with northbound MD 2 running along three-lane Calvert Street and southbound MD 2 running along four-lane St. Paul Street. The route crosses many streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street. <b>The</b> <b>one-way</b> pair passes by Mercy Medical Center before coming to US 40.

5|$|Business Spur Interstate96 (BS I-96) was a {{business}} spur of I-96 in the Muskegon area. It was formerly the route of US16 from the carferry docks in Muskegon {{to the end of}} I-96 in Norton Shores. The spur ran concurrently with M-46 southeasterly from the docks along Mart Street and Sixth Street. At the intersections with <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pairing of Webster Avenue (southbound) and Muskegon Avenue (northbound) in downtown Muskegon, BS I-96 separated from M-46 and turned southward to follow Bus.

US31 ran southwesterly along <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair for a few blocks before the two directions of traffic merged onto the north–south section of Seaway Drive southwest of downtown. The business route then ran due south along Seaway Drive, exiting Muskegon at Sherman Drive and crossing onto a section of the Norton Shores–Muskegon Heights city line. South of Norton Avenue, Seaway Drive turned eastward along the southern edge of Muskegon Heights. BS I-96/Bus. US31 ran along the northern edge of Mona Lake and crossed the Black Creek in Norton Shores. Southwest of the lake, the business route came to an end at the interchange along US31 that marked the western starting point of I-96.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} become DE 4 existed as a county road. The road from Stanton to Wilmington was paved four years later and the portion west of Stanton was paved by 1936. In 1936, work was {{underway}} to improve the road between Stanton and Newport by widening and resurfacing it, with completion a year later. In 1957, Maryland Avenue between Silview and Boxwood Road was widened to four lanes and <b>the</b> <b>one-way</b> pair along Market Street and Justis Street in Newport was established.|$|E
30|$|Two-way {{relaying}} strategies [7] {{have attracted}} considerable research attention, {{due to their}} potential to provide substantially higher spectral efficiency than <b>the</b> conventional <b>one-way</b> relaying counterpart [8 – 15]. Under the FD two-way relaying, the overall network throughput could further be enhanced by exchanging data in only one time slot as opposed to four in <b>the</b> HD <b>one-way</b> relaying. However, <b>the</b> tradeoff is that an FD two-way relaying scheme suffers even more severe interferences than <b>the</b> FD <b>one-way</b> relaying. It is {{the direct result of}} allowing concurrent transmissions at both communication ends. Importantly, the rise in the interference level may null out any throughput gain achieved by using fewer time slots.|$|R
