5|$|A {{squadron}} of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived {{to reinforce the}} city on 17 March, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only one {{in two or three}} crenelles, and they were deficient in both armament and morale: news of Murad's approach at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.|$|E
5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{office to}} investigate Peng's past {{in order to}} find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E

The Controller approves all payments made {{out of the city}} treasury and audits the executive departments. As an independently elected official, the Controller is not responsible to the mayor or the city council. The office was created as one of the good-government reforms intended to reduce the corruption that had previously plagued city government and led to the reform coalition of 1951.|$|E

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|However, the Hungarian noblemen, {{dissatisfied}} with the disorder, rebelled against his rule, and defeated him at Mirăslău on September 18, 1600. At the same time, the Poles invaded Moldavia and restored Ieremia Movilă to the throne; then they entered Wallachia, where Simion Movilă defeated Michael the Brave at Buzău. In this moment of crisis, Michael the Brave left for Prague {{to appeal to the}} emperor for support. He returned to Transylvania in July 1601 at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> imperial army. Cooperating with the imperial general, Giorgio Basta, he defeated the Transylvanian troops at Guruslău on August 3, but on August 19 he was assassinated on the order of his former ally, Giorgio Basta.|$|E

Bielovucic was awarded the Legion of Honour, {{as well as the}} Croix de guerre with a bronze palm and a number of Belgian and Peruvian medals. Later on he worked as <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engine testing team in Bellanger and then as the principal of an aviation school in Reims. Bielovucic retired from active piloting in 1920, and returned to Peru where he became lieutenant commander of the PAC Reserve, regarded as a national hero.|$|E

In the midst of his preparations, Nikephoros was overthrown and killed by John Tzimiskes, who thus became the new Byzantine emperor.|$|E

5|$|More {{complete}} aetosaur {{remains were}} found from the Lower Stubensandtein of Germany in the 1870s. Among them were complete articulated skeletons of 22 aetosaurs. These specimens {{were found in}} a large sandstone outcrop near Stuttgart and were preserved together in an area less than 2 square metres in size. The animals were probably buried under lake sediment soon after they died, with {{the flow of water}} repositioning their bodies on the lake bed and putting them in close proximity to one another. In 1877, German paleontologist Oskar Fraas assigned these specimens to the newly erected genus Aetosaurus. Fraas named the genus after the skull's resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eagle, with a narrow, elongate skull and a pointed snout.|$|E
5|$|PedroI invaded Portugal at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> army in July 1832. Faced {{at first}} with {{what seemed a}} {{national}} civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the Iberian Peninsula in a struggle between proponents of Liberalism and those seeking a return to Absolutism. PedroI died of tuberculosis on 24 September 1834, {{just a few months}} after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.|$|E

50|$|A dependent-marking {{language}} has grammatical markers of agreement and case government between {{the words of}} phrases that tend to appear more on dependents than on <b>heads.</b> <b>The</b> distinction between head-marking and dependent-marking was first explored by Johanna Nichols in 1986, and has since become a central criterion in language typology in which languages are classified according to whether they are more head-marking or dependent-marking. Many languages employ both head and dependent-marking, but some employ double-marking, and yet others employ zero-marking. However, {{it is not clear}} that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clause has anything to do with <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> noun phrase, or even what <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clause is.|$|R
