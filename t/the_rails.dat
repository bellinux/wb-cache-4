5|$|A serious {{accident}} occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the bogies {{on the leading}} coach left <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) to be injured seriously {{enough for them to}} be taken to the Western Infirmary.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E
5|$|In April 1980 the {{locomotive}} again took to <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> and thereafter was employed in hauling many enthusiasts' trains. After a substantial overhaul, the Duchess was declared fit in 1990 {{to continue working}} on the national network {{and at the same}} time the museum purchased it outright from Butlins. In 1998, however, {{the locomotive}} returned to static display at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E

50|$|Whether a grind is back-side (BS) or front-side (FS) {{depends on}} how rider {{approaches}} <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> or edge. If the skater approaches <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> {{with his back to}} it, the grind is a back-side grind. If the skater approaches <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> with <b>the</b> front of his body to <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> <b>the</b> grind is a front-side grind.|$|R
3000|$|The {{full-bridge}} {{strain gauge}} A is fixed along {{the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> as shown in Fig.  4 (b). The two sets of strain meters of the full-bridge strain gauge should be perpendicular {{to each other and}} parallel to the direction of <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> When <b>the</b> temperature stress of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> changes, there is [...] R_ 1 /R_ 2 = R_ 3 /R_ 4 because of isotropy. However, <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and sleepers will restrict the prolongation {{in the direction of the}} rail; then, a certain stress (σ) of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> will be generated which will cause a certain strain ε = σ /E [...] in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive, making them difficult to observe. Most have strong legs with long toes, short rounded wings, and are weak fliers.|$|E
5|$|The War Department requisitioned <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> {{during the}} First World War {{and they were}} lifted for scrap in 1917. A {{majority}} of the railway company board proposed seeking an abandonment order at once, but a rival Board was established; they continued to receive the Ebbw Vale Company's contracted lease payments until the lease expired in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} {{failed to}} make the railroad pay, and the company went into receivership again on August 8, 1918. The last passenger train was operated on July 16, 1919 and the last coal train on July 30. Negotiations with the bondholders to resume service were not successful, and <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> were removed in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{a million}} was {{originally}} budgeted to heat <b>the</b> third <b>rail</b> to prevent ice buildup, but later removed as a cost-cutting move. It {{was believed that}} the rapid operation (short headways) would keep <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> free of snow as the passing cars heated <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> This proved not to work, and in operations at just the wrong conditions close to freezing the opposite occurred; when the train passed and heated <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> microscopically thin layers of snow would be melted, and if <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> was below zero as a whole, the water would freeze to <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and cause ice buildup. [...] Another retrofit was required to solve this problem, by adding wooden covers over <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> a system used throughout Toronto's subway system. Even with these covers in place, the line can be shut down with any heavy snowfall that covers <b>the</b> fourth <b>rail</b> to a depth that fills the distance between <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and <b>the</b> linear motor.|$|R
50|$|The {{ministry}} {{was responsible}} for passenger services, regulation of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> industry, development of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> network and rail infrastructure in mainland China, though {{in light of recent}} accidents, there have been calls to institute independent supervision of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> industry.|$|R

5|$|The limpkin {{is a large}} bird in a {{monotypic}} family. It {{is similar}} in appearance to <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> but skeletally it {{is closer to the}} cranes. It is found in marshes and gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rails</b> are a {{large and}} very {{widespread}} family, with nearly 150 species. They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. Island species readily become flightless; of 53 extant or recently extinct taxa restricted to islands, 32 have {{lost the ability to}} fly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rails</b> {{arrived in}} the Battlefords in 1906. The Cutknife Highway Hwy Highway 674 {{to the south and}} the Paynton Ferry on the north {{crossing}} the North Saskatchewan River were both constructed in 1906–1907 creating the main intersection of Provincial Highway 5 (Yellowhead Highway) and Highway 674.|$|E

5000|$|Sliding/grinding across <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> is {{difficult}} because <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> is very steep and short; much different from what skateboarders normally skate.|$|R
5|$|The {{three stories}} above ground are {{constructed}} of SRC, {{and the structure}} is shared by the building and <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> A foyer, bus transit area, generator room, parking lot, and taxi waiting lines {{are on the ground}} floor. The lobby, shops, and staff offices are on the second floor. Train platforms are on the third floor.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{slowdown}} of {{the economy}} {{at the end of}} the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. <b>The</b> <b>rails</b> were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the affordability of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline of the railroad industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant job losses. The city's population declined as workers left for other areas.|$|E
5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of the cars were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
50|$|Each of <b>the</b> <b>Rail</b> Runner {{stations}} {{contains an}} icon to express each community's identity.

50|$|Alonsa grew in {{the early}} 1900s {{with the coming of}} <b>the</b> railroad. <b>The</b> <b>rail</b> line was never {{extended}} beyond Alonsa and in 1961, <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> service ended. With the loss of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> service, <b>the</b> population began to drop. The area is accessible now by Provincial Trunk Highway 50.|$|R
50|$|In this equation, L and V {{refer to}} the lateral and {{vertical}} forces acting upon <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel, δ is the angle made when the wheel flange is in contact with <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> face, and μ is the coefficient of friction between the wheel and <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|R
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. At least some of <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, {{although much of the}} route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. <b>The</b> <b>rails</b> and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|At 2:15 pm on 1July 1965, {{one of the}} two-car yellow trains {{lost control}} while {{approaching}} the lower terminus and ran {{off the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> before smashing into a building. The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the cab and suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries. Although the station was repaired and services were resumed, Pleasurama decided to close the line {{at the end of the}} 1965 holiday season. Services stopped on 26September 1965.|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} force loading instrument for rails {{was developed to}} simulate the longitudinal temperature force of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> of a ballastless track under different <b>rail</b> temperatures. <b>The</b> instrument comprised <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> an end-fixing device, a temperature force application device, and concrete foundation. This instrument could simulate the longitudinal stress distribution of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> under different rail temperature changes and analyze {{the correlation between the}} natural frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and <b>the</b> longitudinal stress generated by temperature variation. The result of the longitudinal stress distribution exhibits good agreement with the simulation results. In addition, the result of the dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> demonstrates good agreement with the former conclusions. This experimental instrument can be potentially developed into a powerful tool for researching <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> features of a ballastless track under different temperature forces...|$|R
5000|$|The joint {{where the}} ends of two rails are {{connected}} to each other is the weakest part of a <b>rail</b> line. <b>The</b> earliest iron <b>rails</b> were joined by a simple fishplate or bar of metal bolted through the web of <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> Stronger methods of joining two rails together have been developed. When sufficient metal is put into <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> joint, <b>the</b> joint is almost {{as strong as the}} rest of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> length. <b>The</b> noise generated by trains passing over <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> joints, described as [...] "the clickity clack of the railroad track", can be eliminated by welding <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> sections together. Continuously welded rail has a uniform top profile even at the joints.|$|R
30|$|RailRoad [12] {{places a}} virtual <b>rail</b> in <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} {{deployment}} area, as shown in Figure 2 e. When the source node generates data, the generated data is stored locally, whereas corresponding meta-data (i.e., event notification) is also forwarded to the nearest node inside <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> When a sink node wants to collect the generated data, a query message is sent into <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> region. This message travels around <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> When it reaches <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> node that stores the relevant event notification, <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> node sends a query notification message to the source node. Finally, source node sends data directly to the sink using GF.|$|R
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> were set into the streets.|$|E
5|$|His {{next project}} was to develop Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which became the world's largest shipyard. Opened as Chesapeake Dry Dock & Construction Company, the {{shipbuilding}} was intended to build boats to transition goods from <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> to the seas. With president Theodore Roosevelt's declaration to create a Great White Fleet, the company entered the warship business by building seven of the first sixteen warships. Today, the shipyard holds a dominant position in the American warship construction business.|$|E
5|$|Late that evening, a two-coach staff train {{pulled out}} of Brill, {{accompanied}} by a band playing Auld Lang Syne and a white flag. The train stopped at each station along the route, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> connecting the tramway to the Metropolitan Railway main line were ceremonially severed.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{the axle}} load for a railway vehicle should be {{such that the}} lateral forces of the wheel against <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> should not exceed 50% of the {{vertical}} down-force of the vehicle on <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> Put another way, there should be twice as much downward force holding the wheel to <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> as there is lateral force which will tend to cause the wheel to climb in turns. This ratio is accomplished by matching the wheelset with <b>the</b> appropriate <b>rail</b> profile to achieve the L/V ratio desired. If the L/V ratio gets too high, the wheel flange will be pressing against <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> face, and during a turn this will cause the wheel to climb the face of <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> potentially derailing <b>the</b> railcar.|$|R
50|$|At first, <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> {{section was}} almost {{symmetrical}} top-to-bottom, and {{was described as}} a double-headed <b>rail.</b> <b>The</b> intention was to invert <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> after <b>the</b> top surface had become worn, but rails tend to develop chair gall, an attrition of <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> where it is supported in the chairs, and this would have made running on the former bottom surface impossibly noisy and irregular. It was better to provide the extra metal on the top surface and gain extra wear there without the need to invert <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> at its half life.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{track circuit}} interrupters were {{directly}} connected to <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> both physically and electrically. One of the track circuit tail cables would {{be connected to the}} interrupter, it being connected to <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> If <b>the</b> interrupter was broken, it was possible that the broken part, with cable still attached, could drop onto <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and allow <b>the</b> track circuit to remain energised and show 'clear'. To overcome this, it is now practice for track circuit interrupters to be insulated from <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> to which they are attached. A track circuit cable is taken via the interrupter, with one end connected to the upper part of it and another end to the lower part. The cable is at opposite polarity to <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> therefore should <b>the</b> broken part of the interrupter drop onto <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> <b>the</b> track circuit will be short circuited and show 'occupied'.|$|R
