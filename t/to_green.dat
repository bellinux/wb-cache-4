5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner <b>to</b> <b>green</b> tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|After Jay Pritzker's {{death in}} 1999, other Pritzker family members {{challenged}} Tom, Nick, and Penny's {{control of the}} businesses in multiple lawsuits. Penny's brothers joined {{in one of the}} lawsuits. In 2001 Tom, Nick, and Penny decided to sell family assets to allow eleven cousins to receive a share, dissolving the family's business ties. Disentangling the family's business interests took nearly a decade. The family sold its controlling stake in the Marmon Group to Bershire Hathaway for $4.5billion in 2008. The Pritzker Realty Group sold Parking Spot, an airport parking management business Penny co-founded in 1998, <b>to</b> <b>Green</b> Courte Partners LLC for $360million in 2011.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear <b>to</b> <b>green</b> or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{original}} incorporated city of Chicago in 1837, Rush Street is one of the city's oldest thoroughfares. Like Clark Street, parts of Rush Street roughly follow the path of an Indian trail called Green Bay trail (later Green Bay Road) that ran <b>to</b> <b>Green</b> Bay, Wisconsin. Early Rush Street was commonly agreed to be desirable place of residence, and hosted the first house designed by an architect in Chicago (designed for the first Mayor of Chicago William Ogden by John M. Van Osdel). The house, bounded by Erie, Ontario, Rush and Cass (now Wabash Avenue) Streets, did not survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.|$|E

5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green <b>to</b> <b>green,</b> overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E

5|$|Springbok colours is {{the name}} given <b>to</b> <b>green</b> and gold blazers awarded {{to members of the}} South Africa {{national}} rugby union team. They were historically awarded to all South African teams and individuals representing the country in international competition following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name 'Springbok' was abandoned by the various control boards since they felt that the term had been abused by the previous apartheid governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement. An exception was made {{in the case of the}} national rugby union team where they have retained the practice of awarding colours.|$|E
5|$|The MTO {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to alleviate traffic in Newmarket on 28 August 2000: a three contract project to widen and extend Highway404. The first contract added an additional lane in each direction in the grass median from Major Mackenzie Drive to Bloomington Road. A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began {{in the summer of}} 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract called for a four lane extension from Davis Drive <b>to</b> <b>Green</b> Lane and the reconstruction of Green Lane into a four-laned arterial road between Leslie Street and Woodbine Avenue.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{greening}} of higher educational institutions. It {{is based on}} a survey carried out on a sample of higher educational institutions within London, UK. A qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews, is applied to assess a) how far the relevant institutions have reached with respect <b>to</b> <b>greening</b> within the areas of energy and solid waste management, b) what the interviewees consider {{to be the most important}} barriers <b>to</b> further <b>green</b> their campuses, and (c) how such barriers can be reduced, or possibly overcome. The study maintains that although the institutions are not at ground zero with respect <b>to</b> <b>greening,</b> their overall environmental quality is relatively poor, particularly concerning recycling. It is argued that the barrier suggested to be of greatest significance by the interviewees, namely budgetary constrains, is at least partly due to a lack of knowledge concerning how greening initiatives can save costs as well as an institutional reluctance to change. It is concluded therefore that one of the most important measures that needs to be undertaken to overcome barriers <b>to</b> <b>greening</b> is <b>to</b> raise the environmental awareness within campus communities...|$|R

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format. The player assumes {{the role of a}} knight who enters the plague-infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four demons who reside within. Additionally, all residents from the village have been transformed into vampires and other supernatural creatures. Contact with these monsters infects the knight, with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then <b>to</b> <b>green,</b> which will lead to the character's death. The knight may be hit up to three times by an enemy, however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted.|$|E
5|$|The species {{occurs in}} coastal regions of Southwest Australia, from Gingin and Muchea north of Perth south to Augusta and east {{along the south}} coast <b>to</b> <b>Green</b> Range, east of Albany. It also occurs in the Stirling Range, a {{possible}} disjunction; and at Narrogin, a certain and substantial disjunction. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: during times of higher rainfall, the distribution of A.obovatus {{would have been much}} more extensive. Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia.|$|E
5|$|Utah prevailed and US-50 did not {{continue}} to follow the Lincoln Highway to Salt Lake City as Nevada had wanted. The first continuous route of US-50 across eastern Nevada and western Utah was an arch shaped route. US-50 proceeded north from Ely along what is now numbered U.S. Route 93 and Alternate US-93 where the highway would merge with the Victory Highway (U.S. Route 40 along the Wendover Cut-off, since replaced by I-80) to Salt Lake.
