25|$|Will Smith {{conceived}} {{this story}} {{when he was}} watching the television show called I Shouldn't Be Alive with his brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett. It was originally not a science fiction story but about {{a father and son}} crashing their car in the mountains or some remote region, with the son having <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> rescue for his father. Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple log line for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|The album sold well {{despite being}} {{initially}} {{pulled from the}} shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. [...] The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating, [...] "Our record {{has been in the}} marketplace {{for more than a year}} now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective... We have decided to put a sticker on the record". This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, [...] "It's almost taunting kids <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the record to see what we're saying on it". The album also had four successful singles which were [...] "Whatever", [...] "Keep Away", [...] "Voodoo" [...] and [...] "Bad Religion".|$|E

2500|$|Schuldiner {{continued}} {{to work on his}} music, continuing his work with Control Denied. [...] About two years after his original diagnosis, in May 2001, the cancer returned and Schuldiner fell ill again. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the tumor pre-dated insurance being taken out. [...] Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner's medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium has also stated that the band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner {{while he was in the}} hospital in their days as a local band. Schuldiner received chemotherapy with vincristine. [...] Like most drugs used in the treatment of cancer, the side effects were harsh and weakened him greatly. [...] In late October/early November, Schuldiner's condition worsened as he became ill with pneumonia.|$|E
2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll." ...|$|E

"Yes; but if {{you take}} my advice you will do as most of them do, get a big basket and lay in a stock of bread and cooked meat, cheese, and {{anything}} you fancy, then you will only have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a cup of tea at the stopping-places. It comes a good bit cheaper, and you get done before those who take their meals, and can slip back into the cars again quick and keep your corner seat.
