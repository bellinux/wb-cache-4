50|$|When deeds {{are taken}} as joint tenants with rights of {{survivorship}} (JTWROS) or joint tenants in common (TIC), any co-owner can file a petition for partition {{to dissolve the}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationship.</b> JTWROS deed holders always take the property in equal shares; therefore, if the partnership is dissolved through partition, the proceeds must be equally distributed between all of the co-owners without regard to how much each co-owner contributed to the purchase price of the property. No credits would be allowed for any excess contributions to the purchase price. For example, if A and B co-own property as JTWROS and A contributed 80% of the purchase price, A and B would still receive equal distributions upon partition. On the other hand, TIC deed holders may be granted at partition a credit for unequal contributions to purchase price. During either partition, credits may be awarded to any co-owner who may have contributed in excess of his share to the property expenses after taking deed to the property. Credits may be allowed for utilities and maintenance; however, credits for improvements may not be allowed unless the improvements actually added substantial value to the property.|$|E

Owners, often absentee, customarily employed local peasants to collect coconuts rather than engage in <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationships.</b> The villagers were paid on a piece-rate basis. Those employed in the coconut industry tended to be less educated and older than the average person in the rural labor force and earned lower-than-average incomes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of agrarian tenancy contract choice and its implication on productivity in prewar Japan. Rapid agricultural growth under extensive <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationships</b> in prewar Japan was achieved with the prevalence of a unique rent reduction contract, which was more efficient than a share tenancy or a pure fixed-rent contract in terms of provision of incentives and risk-sharing. Despite its potential efficiency, a rent reduction contract incurred substantial transaction costs, which may have inhibited its adoption outside Japan. The prevalence of this contract in prewar Japan was likely due {{to the presence of}} villages that reduced such costs through informal governance of the private <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationships.</b> We found quantitatively at the village level that the choice of tenancy contract in prewar Iwate prefecture was affected by risk and possibly transaction costs. Furthermore, a sign of Marshallian inefficiency was found at the prefecture level, where the prevalence of tenancy and productivity is negatively correlated and such inefficiency was worse in prefectures with a greater proportion of share tenancy. ...|$|R

40|$|Most Real Estate Property Management Companies (PMC) in {{most cases}} struggles with service charge funds (SCF) to provide {{amenities}} for tenants living in their serviced apartments after budget has been carefully prepared and approved and payments made by occupants. This paper investigated the effect of motivational aspect of budgetary control on the service charge management performance in PMCs in Nigeria. The sample frame consists of 4 major PMC with 380 staff stratified into two groups - group 1 (Luxurious) and group 2 (commercial). The sample size {{is made up of}} 95 staff representing 25 % of the frame selected at random. Data was collected through structured questionnaire and analyzed. Z-test was used for hypotheses confirmation. Findings proved that budgetary control has significant influence on workers motivation which leads to savings in the service charge expenditure but not effectively employed in the subsector hence the inefficiency in Service charge expenditure (SCE) management. The study recommended that budgetary control should be intensified to motivate employees to embark on service cost minimization to gain savings or at least achieve a state of breakeven. This will promote <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationship</b> in the managed estates and the achievement of PMC financial objective...|$|E
40|$|This book {{chapter is}} {{the outcome of}} an {{interdisciplinary}} research project (law and retail research) on the generic nature and economies of shopping malls. The starting point of consideration was that there is legal uncertainty how the <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationship</b> in malls, i. e. rent vs. lease, {{should be considered in}} lease/rental contracts. The answer to this question has considerable consequences on the rights and liabilities of the owner/landlord of shopping malls and the shop owners regarding e. g. right to cancel, time limitations of the contract etc [...] From the retail research point of view the question arises if shop owners just pay the rent/lease in shopping malls for the provided space or is there an add-on value they benefit from being located in a ‘retail agglomerations’. The article provide in-depth conceptual insights into the different use of the term shopping mall compared to other agglomeration formats, e. g. shopping streets or other kinds of shopping centres. Furthermore, it is shown that a mall is ‘more {{than the sum of its}} parts’ based on the evaluation of so called agglomeration effects. The existence and impact of such benefits for both tenants and customers are investigated based on three extensive empirical studies and the analysis of secondary data...|$|E
50|$|At Welkite {{an extreme}} example of an attempt at {{eviction}} of tenants before the Ethiopian revolution {{is reported to have}} occurred. A retired colonel living in the area held title to 4,000 hectares, which some 500 tenants cultivated. Following a fertilizer demonstration by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization in 1969, the colonel decided to introduce modernized farming. At first he decided to modernize rapidly and announced {{that he was going to}} terminate the <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationships</b> with all of his tenants. The tenants, however, are said to have responded violently, attempting to stone their landlord one night as he left a bar in Welkite. The colonel then changed tactics, modernizing his lands piecemeal and evicting smaller numbers of tenants. By 1972 he had 160 hectares under tractor cultivation, and 140 tenant families were said to have been evicted. These people did not, however, leave the area, relying on the ensete cultivations around their houses for a minimum of food.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to reflection {{on the question of}} land markets in Africa. Based on a case study of Abure society (Cote d'Ivoire), the article emphasizes, first, the relation between the intra-family dimension of land rights and the functioning of the land lease market. Particular attention is paid to intra-family land tensions induced by the land lease market, and their repercussions in the form of inter-community conflict reflecting the ethnic-national basis of the land lease market (with autochthonous Abure lessors and Burkinabe tenants). Second, emphasis is placed on the socio-political dimension of land <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationships.</b> The article is based on a deciphering of the land rights and land tenure practices within Abure family groups, and of a 2001 conflict which set Abure young men against Burkinabe pineapple growers. Beyond the inter-community conflict surrounding land, the article reveals an intergenerational conflict within Abure society itself between social juniors and the elders who manage family land, regarding the delegation of rights to lease out family land and the distribution of land lease (rental) income...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} ethnographic research into two Chinese urban villages, {{where thousands of}} rural migrants who were bureaucratically categorised as ‘floating population’ established their settlements in the city. The goal of the research is to display the place-making process through the everyday practices of the rural migrants in their urban settlements and {{to examine the relationship}} between this place-making process and the formation of the migratory identity in contemporary Chinese urban society. Based on long-term participative observations and in-depth interviews, an impressionist picture is painted to depict the lived world of rural migrants in this small, marginal, yet complex, colourful neighbourhood. This picture contains vivid snapshots of various aspects of people's everyday life in the place, including street life, <b>tenancy</b> <b>relationships,</b> neighbourhood interactions, housing forms, television and public telephone consumption, as well as festival celebrations, most of which are put into academic documentation for the first time. All these scenes commonly affirm the active engagements of the rural migrants in the place-making politics of this unique urban locale and their flexible emplacement in the locality, which defies the ideological construction of this group as always displaced, floating, and out of place in the city. More importantly, the urban villages, as the principal geographical form of rural migratory settlement in Chinese cities, provide a prime example of the ‘progressive sense of place’ in 21 st Century Chinese urban society that is featured by multiplicity, fluidity, and connectivity. At the same time, this research distinguishes itself from previous work on the same subject with its sharp focus on the place-making process occurring at the micro and banal level. It has discovered that people’s daily activities like dwelling, walking, street gathering, telephone calling, deliver an empowering space where place is not constructed by conscious planning and design, but by bodily doing and living. Beyond the phenomenological geography of lifeworld which tends to be depoliticised, the study sheds light on the question of asymmetries of power and socio-economic inequities in the lifeworld in the urban villages and tries to represent the rural migrants’ spatial struggles in the place as a tactical resistance that does not necessarily direct towards some end or form, but has the potential to undermine and deflect the totalising ambitions of the dominant power strategies. The above insights drawn from the two urban villages are not only informative in understanding Chinese rural migratory communities in the urban setting, but also revelatory in awakening the sense of place and grasping the complexity of the broader place-making politics in the late modern and transitional society...|$|R
40|$|Past polices {{with land}} redistribution, {{prohibition}} of land renting and later legalisation of short-term contracts only, may have prevented or undermined tenancy markets in Ethiopia. Recent policies providing more secure {{rights to land}} and allowing more long-term rental contracts may contribute to more efficient land rental markets. This paper examines the allocative efficiency of the land rental market in Northern Ethiopia {{and the extent to}} which adjustment in the tenancy market is constrained by transaction costs, using data collected about four years after land users were given land certificates. The analyses demonstrate significant transaction costs in the market through a high share of non-participants in the market and low adjustment coefficients to own land for those participating. We tested whether contracts among kin partners involve lower transaction costs possibly due to higher trust among kin. We found that access by tenants was less contrained in communities with a high share of kinship contracts out of all contracts. We did not find higher coefficients for own land in contracts among kin than among non-kin indicating that adjustment in contracts among kin is as inefficient as among non-kin. Higher probability of participation for those with previous experience in the tenancy market implies that there are nonconvex transaction costs and entry barriers causing substantial involuntary non-participation in the market for <b>tenancies.</b> Positive <b>relationships</b> between own farm size and probability of renting in land as well as area rented in by tenants, indicate that there are economies of scale in production, limiting the opportunities for landless and land-poor households of using the land rental market as a ladder to escape poverty. Key words: Land tenancy, market participation, transaction costs, kinship contracts, selection bias. ...|$|R
40|$|Four {{important}} and inter-related {{issues in the}} economics of agriculture in developing countries are production efficiency, tenancy, technological innovation and rural-urban migration. These issues are {{examined in this study}} by analysing the working of rural factor markets using empirical evidence on selected farmers in four villages and an important sub-division in Pakistans Punjab province. The pattern of land holding in Pakistan suggests that land is very unequally distributed. This observation is the basis for may proposals of land reform. It has been argued that inequality in land distribution is undesirable per se as well as because it leads to inefficiency in agricultural production. Empirical evidence from the villages suggests that an inverse relationship exists between farm size and productivity thus lending support to {{the second part of the}} argument. Explanations in terms of the working of rural land and labour markets are offered for the existence of the <b>relationship.</b> <b>Tenancy</b> is important in Pakistan. Its existence is explained in terms of adjustments in factor endowments by landowners and landless cultivators given that markets for labour and draught power operate imperfectly. Different tenurial contracts imply different sets of incentives that influence decisions regarding resource allocation on the farm. The empirical evidence suggests that adjustments are made - such as devising cost-sharing, input stipulation and supervision arrangements - to ensure that different tenurial contracts are equally efficient. It is argued that despite the apparent difficulties of access to 'green revolution' technology inputs due to imperfections in their distribution and scarcity of rural credit, small farms use inputs such as high yield variety seeds and chemical fertilizers no less intensively compared to the large farmers. The evidence suggests that new markets for factor services and intricate but more accessible networks of fertilizer and seed distribution may have developed to facilitate the use by small farmers. The relationship between migration and rural credit markets is examined. It is argued that migration may improve the credit ratings of households and thus may facilitate borrowing in the rural credit market. Detailed comments are also made on the role of other rural-end variables such as non-farm income, mechanization, output per capita, education and available land per capita in influencing the decision to migrate. The underlying theme of the study is the analysis of operations in rural factor markets. We analyse, carefully, interactions in these markets and then examine some important aspects of policies in the light of our analysis of the four issues...|$|R
40|$| ethical values. The duty is a {{categorical}} imperative {{without the}} ability to opt for damages instead of performing the obligation. I wish to emphasise, obviously, the efficient breach theory that provides for “[t]he view that a party {{should be allowed to}} breach a contract and pay damages, if doing so would be more economically efficient than performing under the contract. ” The duration of the contract is the framework in which an ethical approach is more appropriate, and we should note three points. One is that when a relationship lasts for an extended period it creates reliance and proximity. This is valid, even though one party is an enterprise; otherwise we create a moral shield in favour of people who take advantage of the enterprise and conceive the enterprise as a machine in which people are mere cogs to be exploited. Moreover, regarding ‘Basic Necessity Life-contracts’, the extended period tends to aggravate the differences between a professional party (an enterprise) and a person who contracts for personal purposes (labour, loan for the purchase of a house, guarantee in favour of a family member, tenancy for housing), {{especially in the case of}} a change in circumstances, given that an enterprise is more able to calculate risks and administer their costs than are non-professionals. Finally, the different relationships may be inextricable, and in certain cases we can speak about contractual links (collegamento negoziale, Verbundene Verträge) : for example, labour, <b>tenancy,</b> loans, family <b>relationships.</b> Art. 33 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides for the principle of reconciliation between family and professional life. In this perspective, the contract of labour ensures the sanctity of maternity; evidently the duty to the family (child) is more important than the duty to perform. The law restricts the right to withdrawal of a tenancy in order to protect the rights to housing not only of the tenant but also of family or cohabitants with children. We can imagine a right to suspend payment of instalments on a loan in cases of redundancy through no fault of the debtor when the worker has to provide for a member of the family (to pay school fees, to pay medical bills for themselves or for a member of the family). In cases of a guarantee by a non-professional person in favour of a member of the family, the bank has at least a duty to keep the guarantor regularly updated as to the financial circumstances of the debtor and the consequences the guarantee would have to share in order to allow the guarantor to terminate the contract before default proceedings have been initiated, when circumstances have varied too greatly from the initial contractual obligations. Scholars tend to be too rigid in their distinction between the purposes of private law and those of public law. The first must provide rules in order to promote commutative justice and Freiheitsethik, while only public law has the obligation to apply distributive justice. This distinction appears to me to be too rigid, and I would prefer a more systemic view, stressing that the relationship between the two distinctive components of the law should be more coherent. Private law is able to pursue some distributive justice under certain conditions. A clear definition is needed of the subjects (weak parties) who are protected and the subjects who should be protected. Interests or goods to be protected should also be clearly defined. There should be goods of recognisable intrinsic value (necessary goods like water, schooling, housing, health, etc). Some are referred to as common goods (commons) because they relate to the fundamental rights of people and thus should not be subject to exclusive possession, but instead be governed according to the law so that everyone can benefit from them. Self-determination in a solidaristic system cannot be the unique criterion for evaluating the value of goods. In particular, it is essential to specify a number of constitutional values related to certain professions. Bankers, for example, must execute due diligence with respect to the savings of non-professional people to ensure that those savings are safeguarded, since savings are a good protected by the law (an example is the Italian constitution: see art. 47. La repubblica incoraggia e tutela il risparmio in tutte le sue forme, disciplina, coordina e controlla l’esercizio del credito). Thus, certain rules should be taken into consideration in order to promote ‘responsible credit’ as a paradigm for measuring the performance of the good banker (as Reifner suggests). This could be considered as an application of good faith that requires the professional debtor to perform the specific skills of their particular profession in order to pursue the interests of the creditor. The reference to a moral value provides a justification for duties, whether or not those duties are disproportionate to the compensation for them or are imposed without any compensation at all, simply to protect the weaker party. However, elements of distributive justice require social recognition of the fact that public law must provide (incentives, benefits, advantages). Otherwise the duties imposed on a private individual may be interpreted as expropriation or punishment. Of course, solidarity should not become a synallagma, but it still requires a degree of reciprocity, which is a social response. In conclusion, distributive justice remains in general a duty and prerogative of public law, and one should not overload contract law, but contract law can be made to cohere with it through the provision of rules consistent with this purpose...|$|R
