She is then seen at the reception telling Barney about how he toyed with her emotions, after which they go out to have sex.|$|E
2500|$|The early 20th {{century was}} {{the dawn of the}} movie age, and in Detroit it began on Monroe Avenue. [...] The first movie theater in Detroit, the Casino, was opened on Monroe Avenue in 1906 by John H. Kunsky. [...] It was reputedly the second movie theatre in the world, [...] and it {{propelled}} Kunsky to a 20-theatre empire worth $7 million in 1929. [...] Later in 1906, Detroit's second movie theatre, the Bijou, opened literally <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> <b>down</b> from the Casino. [...] These were the first of a string of theaters along this section of Monroe; three new movie theatre buildings were constructed [...] in the area in the next five years: the Star (1907), designed by Frank G. Baxter and Henry A. O'Dell; the Columbia (1911), designed by the noted theatre architect C. Howard Crane; and the National Theater (1911), the only theatre designed by Albert Kahn. [...] In addition, the Family Theater opened in 1914 in an older building in the district. Other nearby theaters included the Temple Theater at Woodward Avenue across Monroe, the Liberty (located behind the Star), and the Palace at 130-132 Monroe.|$|E
50|$|This {{series was}} {{available}} either with a flip-down tailgate or <b>two</b> <b>doors.</b> The fold <b>down</b> gate had a window which wound down electrically.

Until this model change, the Travelall had been considered merely {{a version of the}} related pickup truck; after the facelift the Travelall became a separate series.|$|R

2500|$|After John Wanamaker's {{death in}} 1922 the {{business}} carried on under Wanamaker family ownership. Rodman Wanamaker, John's son, enhanced {{the reputation of}} the stores as artistic centers and temples of the beautiful, offering imported luxuries from around the world. He died shortly before the Great Depression, and after his death in 1928, the stores (managed for the family by a trust) continued to thrive for a time. The men's clothing and accessories department was expanded into its own separate store on the lower floors of the Lincoln-Liberty Building, <b>two</b> <b>doors</b> <b>down</b> on Chestnut Street, in 1932. This building, which also had a private apartment for the Wanamaker family on its top floor, was sold to Philadelphia National Bank in 1952; the initials on the building's crown read [...] "PNB" [...] until November 2014, even though the bank no longer existed (PNB was acquired by CoreStates, which was then acquired by First Union, which in turn was acquired by Wachovia Corporation, which was acquired by Wells Fargo & Co.). Over time, Wanamaker's lost business to other retail chains, including Bloomingdale's and Macy's, in the Philadelphia market. The Wanamaker Family Trust finally sold John Wanamaker and Company, with its underpatronized stores, to Los Angeles, California-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores for $60 million (USD) cash in 1978. Carter Hawley Hale poured another $80 million (USD) into renovating the stores, but to no avail—customers had gone elsewhere in the intervening decades and did not come back.|$|E
