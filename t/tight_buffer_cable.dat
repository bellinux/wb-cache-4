5000|$|For use in more strenuous environments, a {{much more}} robust cable {{construction}} is required. In loose-tube construction the fiber is laid helically into semi-rigid tubes, allowing the cable to stretch without stretching the fiber itself. This protects the fiber from tension during laying and due to temperature changes. Loose-tube fiber may be [...] "dry block" [...] or gel-filled. Dry block offers less protection to the fibers than gel-filled, but costs considerably less. Instead of a loose tube, the fiber may be embedded in a heavy polymer jacket, commonly called [...] "tight buffer" [...] construction. <b>Tight</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>cables</b> are offered {{for a variety of}} applications, but the two most common are [...] "Breakout" [...] and [...] "Distribution". Breakout cables normally contain a ripcord, two non-conductive dielectric strengthening members (normally a glass rod epoxy), an aramid yarn, and 3 mm buffer tubing with an additional layer of Kevlar surrounding each fiber. The ripcord is a parallel cord of strong yarn that is situated under the jacket(s) of the cable for jacket removal. Distribution cables have an overall Kevlar wrapping, a ripcord, and a 900 micrometer buffer coating surrounding each fiber. These fiber units are commonly bundled with additional steel strength members, again with a helical twist to allow for stretching.|$|R

A plastic boot is normally used for strain relief and protection from moisture.

40|$|A G. 652. D {{compliant}} {{single-mode fibre}} {{has been developed}} which has superior macrobending performance compared to legacy fibres in this category. The macrobending performance of this fibre is demonstrated at tighter bending diameters down to 20 mm and shown to exceed the performance of legacy G. 652. D fibre by several times. It is further demonstrated that the tighter fibre bending diameter enabled by the macrobending properties of this fibre is still sufficiently large as to ensure against premature mechanical failure. The fibre is shown to be compatible with legacy G. 652. D fibres in studies of fusion splicing performance. Several applications are suggested {{for the use of}} this fibre type to bring economic value, particularly to the access network. Allowing tighter bends in the optical fibre can enable smaller fibre management hardware such as optical distribution frames and wall units. <b>Tight</b> <b>buffered</b> patch cords may be designed for installation in more restricted spaces.

40|$|Puri and Aravind's {{method of}} {{macroblock}} bit count estimation for video rate control {{is based on}} the classification of the macroblock data into discrete classes and assigning a unique non-linear estimate for each class and quantization parameter pair. This method stands apart from other methods in the literature, since the model of the bit count versus the quantization parameter relation, parameterized by macroblock variance, is a discrete model generated solely from measurements, We extend their technique for low-delay video rate control (<b>tight</b> <b>buffer</b> regulation) in two ways. We propose a strategy of near-uniform quantization parameter assignments to the macroblocks of a frame that can come close to maximizing an objective spatial quality function, such as PSNR, over the entire frame. We also adaptively update the quantization parameter assignments for the yet to be coded macroblocks, after the encoding of each macroblock, to compensate for any errors in the bit count estimation of the encoded macroblock. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed rate control method can more accurately control the number of bits expended for a frame, as well as yield a higher objective spatial quality than the method adopted by TMN 8.

Here {{we show that}} <b>tight</b> regulation of <b>buffered</b> intracellular metal concentrations {{is a prerequisite for}} metal specificity of Zur, ZntR, RcnR and FrmR in Salmonella Typhimurium. In cells, at non-inhibitory elevated concentrations, Zur and ZntR, only respond to Zn(II), RcnR to cobalt and FrmR to formaldehyde. However, in vitro all these sensors bind non-cognate metals, which alters DNA binding. We model the responses of these sensors to intracellular-buffered concentrations of Co(II) and Zn(II) based upon determined abundances, metal affinities and DNA affinities of each apo- and metalated sensor. The cognate sensors are modelled to respond at the lowest concentrations of their cognate metal, explaining specificity. However, other sensors are modelled to respond at concentrations only slightly higher, and cobalt or Zn(II) shock triggers mal-responses that match these predictions. Thus, perfect metal specificity is fine-tuned to a narrow range of buffered intracellular metal concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Broadband Cable Networks (BCNs) is {{the most}} {{important}} form of broadband service in the US, which significantly improves the bandwidth to home. However, providing efficient Video-On-Demand (VOD) service on BCNs is still a challenging issue {{due to the lack of}} effective approaches to exploit the unique characteristics of BCNs. In this study, we address this issue by fully utilizing the characteristics of BCNs, such as subchannel sharing and potential large <b>buffer</b> space at <b>cable</b> modems. We propose an optimal full-sharing scheduling approach that minimizes the bandwidth consumption of video sessions. Through analysis and simulation, we have shown that our approach has remarkable advantages in minimizing the bandwidth consumption, compared with the previous approaches. Therefore, our approach satisfies more simultaneous VOD sessions on a fixedcapacity channel. Furthermore, we design two adaptation algorithms which not only keep bandwidth consumption minimal but also significantly reduce the mean service delay to 30 % or less of the mean service delay without adaptation.

The specific utilization of encryption and {{the implementation of}} the AES will be based on many factors particular to the computer system and its associated components. Communication security provides protection to data by enciphering it at the transmitting point and deciphering it at the receiving point. File security provides protection to data by enciphering it when it is recorded on a storage medium and deciphering it when it is read back from the storage medium. In the proposed design the security method uses symmetric Cryptography technique which provides same keys to sender and receiver to transfer the information for reducing the design complexity.

50|$|As Fairford had {{not been}} {{conceived}} as a terminus, its layout created a number of problems. The 246 ft platform was inconveniently sited across the station throat which prevented the yard from being easily shunted {{if there was a}} train at the platform. In the event, this defect {{did not need to be}} remedied as the station was never particularly busy; receipts from 1903, 1913 and 1923 show that on average 6,500 tickets were issued whilst goods traffic handled never exceeded 10,000 tons and around 400 parcels were dispatched, although there was at one time a substantial milk traffic with 15,000 gallons being sent daily to London. In addition, there was insufficient space for the engine to run around the train for the return journey, meaning that the train had to be pulled forward to the goods loop where the engine was detached and positioned on the adjacent track to haul the coaches to the <b>buffers</b> using a <b>cable</b> until the points were cleared and the engine could regain its position.|$|R
