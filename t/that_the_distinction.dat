5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. The first is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption {{on the ground}} that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E

40|$|In contemplating any {{life and}} death moral dilemma, one is often struck by the {{possible}} importance of two distinctions; <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between killing and “letting die”, and <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between an intentional killing and an action aimed at some other outcome that causes death as a foreseen but unintended “side-effect”. Many feel intuitively that these distinctions are morally significant, but attempts to explain why this might be so have been unconvincing. In this paper, I explore the problem from an explicitly consequentialist point of view. I first review and endorse <b>the</b> arguments <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinctions</b> cannot be drawn with perfect clarity, {{and that they do}} not have the kind of fundamental significance required to defend an absolute prohibition on killing. I go on to argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinctions</b> are nonetheless important. A complete consequentialist account of morality must include a consideration of our need and ability to construct and follow rules; our instincts about these rules; and the consequences (to the agent and to others) that might follow if the agent breaks a good general rule, particularly if this involves acting contrary to moral instinct. With this perspective, I suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinctions</b> between killing and letting die and between intending and foreseeing do have moral relevance, especially for those involved in the care of the sick and dying...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between the global and local versions is that the former relates maps between sheaves, whereas the latter relates (complexes of) sheaves directly and so can be evaluated locally.

25|$|Although some {{consider}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between transpersonal {{psychology and}} {{the psychology of}} religion, is fading (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still {{generally considered to be}} a clear distinction between the two.

25|$|According to Camilleri, Bohr thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> {{between a}} wave view and a {{particle}} view {{was defined by}} a distinction between experimental setups, while, differing, Heisenberg {{thought that it was}} defined by the possibility of viewing the mathematical formulas as referring to waves or particles.

Heisenberg thought that every mathematical formulation was capable of both wave and particle interpretations.|$|E
25|$|The many-minds {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} extends the many-worlds interpretation by proposing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between worlds should be made {{at the level of}} the mind of an individual observer.

The name many-minds interpretation was first used by David Albert and Barry Loewer in 1988.|$|E

25|$|The {{description}} of Benjamin being born after the arrival in Canaan is thought by some scholars {{to refer to}} the tribe of Benjamin coming into existence by branching from the Joseph group after the tribe had settled in Canaan.

25|$|Much of the {{theoretical}} work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives—algorithms with basic cryptographic properties—and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc.|$|E
