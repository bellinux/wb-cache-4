5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance.

5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the different}} groups of bats {{have been the subject}} of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognized differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or monophyletic group. In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence was offered that stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The so-called flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats, debate continues as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of available genetic and morphological evidence.|$|E

25|$|Georgian is an agglutinative language. There {{are certain}} prefixes and suffixes that are joined {{together}} {{in order to}} build a verb.

The verb can be broken down to parts: a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t. Each morpheme here contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the verb tense or the person who has performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits polypersonalism; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the subject and the object.|$|E
