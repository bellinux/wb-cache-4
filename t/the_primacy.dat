40|$|Corporate {{directors}} have a fiduciary duty {{to make decisions}} {{in the best interests}} of the shareholders. This aspect of fiduciary duty is often called <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm. Legal scholars generally assume that <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm is a major factor considered by boards of directors of publicly traded corporations in making ordinary business decisions and that changing <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm would have an effect on the substance of those decisions. This Article challenges this view and argues that <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm was never equipped to mediate conflicts between shareholders and nonshareholder constituencies of a corporation. The origins and development of <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm suggest that it was introduced into corporate law to perform a much different and somewhat surprising function: <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm was first used by courts to resolve disputes among majority and minority shareholders, and over time this use of <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm evolved into the modern doctrine of minority oppression. This application of <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm seems incongruous today because minority oppression cases involve conflicts among shareholders, not conflicts between shareholders and nonshareholders. Nevertheless, when early courts employed rules requiring directors to act in the interests of all shareholders (not just the majority shareholders), they were creating <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm. Once used to resolve minority oppression cases, <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm easily found its way into cases involving publicly traded corporations because courts did not routinely distinguish closely held corporations from publicly traded corporations until the middle of this century. But the application of <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm to <b>the</b> ordinary business decisions of publicly traded corporations is muted by the business judgment rule. As a result, even though <b>the</b> shareholder <b>primacy</b> norm is closely associated with debates about the social responsibility of publicly traded corporations, it 2 ̆ 7 s impact on the ordinary business decisions of such corporations is extremely limited...|$|R

Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent sanctions against the king.

5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province.

Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces.

In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} from the lectures, the Canadian Corps staff {{officers}} produced a tactical analysis of the Verdun battles and delivered a series of corps and divisional-level lectures to promote <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of artillery and {{stress the importance of}} harassing fire and company and platoon flexibility.

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} Gregory's main motivation was {{to increase the}} number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.|$|E
5|$|The {{break with}} Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation. That {{was to come}} from the {{dissemination}} of ideas. The views of the German reformer Martin Luther and his school were widely known and disputed in England. A major manifestation of theological radicalism in England was Lollardy, a movement deriving from the writings of John Wycliffe, the 14th century Bible translator, which stressed <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of Scripture. But after the execution of Sir John Oldcastle, leader of the Lollard rebellion of 1415, they never again had access to the levers of power, and by the 15th century were much reduced in numbers and influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German.

Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E

5|$|The {{first book}} starts {{on the topic}} of Greek {{philosophy}}. Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends with a discussion on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any {{specific set of}} rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular.

Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of the material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, {{at least in the}} big picture.|$|E
5|$|A long-running {{dispute between}} the Archbishops of Canterbury and York flared up under Anselm's successor, Ralph d'Escures. Canterbury, {{traditionally}} the senior of the two establishments, had long argued that the Archbishop of York should formally promise to obey their Archbishop, but York argued that the two episcopates were independent within the English Church and that no such promise was necessary. Henry supported <b>the</b> <b>primacy</b> of Canterbury, to ensure that England remained under a single ecclesiastical administration, but the Pope preferred the case of York. The matter was complicated by Henry's personal friendship with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, and the King's desire that the case should not {{end up in a}} papal court, beyond royal control. Henry badly needed the support of the Papacy in his struggle with Louis of France, however, and therefore allowed Thurstan to attend the Council of Rheims in 1119, where Thurstan was then consecrated by the Pope with no mention of any duty towards Canterbury. Henry believed that this went against assurances Thurstan had previously made and exiled him from England until the King and Archbishop came to a negotiated solution the following year.|$|E
