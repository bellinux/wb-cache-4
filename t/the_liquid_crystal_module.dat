In this paper, we present a case study on the LCMSP, which is taken from a final <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> display <b>module</b> (LCM) shop floor in a TFT-LCD industry. For the case we investigated, the jobs are clustered by their product types and the machine setup time is sequentially dependent on the product types of the jobs processed on the machine. In LCMSP, the objective is to maximize the total profit subject to fulfilling contracted quantities without violating the due date and machine capacity restrictions. The LCMSP can be modelled as a multi-level optimization problem. The sub-problem of LCMSP can be transformed into the vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW). One can therefore solve the LCMSP efficiently using existing VRPTW algorithms. We present two new algorithms based on the savings algorithms with some modifications to accommodate the LCMSP. Based on the characteristics of the LCM process, a set of test problems is generated covering most of the real-world applications for test purposes. Computational results and performance comparisons show that the proposed algorithms solved the LCMSP efficiently and near-optimally...|$|R

40|$|Backlight unit (BLU) {{and open}} cell are two {{critical}} parts of <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> display (LCD) <b>module</b> (LCM) {{which is the}} most significant component of LCD TV. To place the open cell into a BLU automatically using an assembly robot, this paper proposes a heuristic hybrid genetic algorithm (HHGA) based shape matching approach to detect the pose (orientation and position) of the BLU. The approach takes advantages of line structures of the BLUs to avoid the most time-consuming exhaustive search. Firstly, obtain initial orientation of a BLU by the dominant orientations which can be obtained with the statistical gradient orientation histograms. Secondly, search the optimal pose through the HHGA which mainly consists of local search strategy, crossover strategy, clone strategy, and mutation strategy. Local search strategy is designed according to the rising trend of matching features around the optimal pose and along the lines. Crossover and clone are heuristic strategies designed according to the distribution characteristics of local maxima to produce new meaningful offspring. Mutation is a necessary strategy to keep the diversity of the population. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested on an image database acquired from the LCM assembly lines and compared with standard hybrid GA and exhaustive search by a new statistical indicator. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a high efficiency within limited time and is suitable for the pose detection of the BLUs...|$|R
