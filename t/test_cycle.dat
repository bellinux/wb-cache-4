40|$|Abstract The direct {{verification}} of Rockwell testing machines comprises four parts such as test force, indenter, depth measuring device, and <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> {{as seen in}} ISO 6508 - 2. Among them, the {{verification of}} <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> is generally carried out by using a stopwatch on industrial sites, which is not so reliable. In addition to this, most of commercial hardness testing machines produced nowadays are automatically controlled by the embedded software, which makes {{it much more difficult}} to calibrate the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle.</b> It implies that even though hardness testing machines are advanced more, the calibration of the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> does not keep up with their advancement. To overcome this problem, an on-site calibration system was developed to calibrate the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> of both the automatically controlled as well as manually controlled Rockwell hardness testing machines. The calibration system is composed of load cell, indentation depth measuring apparatus and embedded clock. Using this system, measurement of test force, application velocity of test force, and indentation depth are possible simultaneously in real time, which enhances the efficiency and reliability of calibration procedure...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to examine the dry rolling/sliding wear behavior of high Si containing carbide free steel {{with respect to the}} austempering temperature and <b>test</b> <b>cycles.</b> Three batches of cylindrical disc specimens were prepared from an alloyed steel, 60 Sicr 7 and were austenitized at 820 C for 30 min. Three different batches of samples were quenched in a salt bath maintained at 250, 300 & 350 C respectively for 1 h. Then the dry rolling/sliding wear tests were performed with each batch of samples for three different <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> namely 6000, 18000 and 30000 cycles respectively to study the wear performance of these specific steels in the context of rail applications along with the in-depth microstructural characterization. The wear resistance was related to the total mass loss measured after the tests and the worn surfaces were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Micro-hardness profiles were also obtained to analyze strain- hardening effects beneath the contact surfaces. The results indicate that the harder material exhibited lower wear rates for different <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> i. e., the one austempered at 250 C showed superior rolling/sliding wear resistance than the rest.
