25|$|Due to its partial agonistic activity, THC {{appears to}} result in greater {{downregulation}} of cannabinoid receptors than endocannabinoids, further limiting its efficacy over other cannabinoids. While tolerance may limit the maximal effects of certain drugs, evidence suggests that tolerance develops irregularly for different effects with greater resistance for primary over side-effects, and may actually serve to enhance the drug's <b>therapeutic</b> <b>window.</b> However, this form of tolerance appears to be irregular throughout mouse brain areas.|$|E
25|$|Some generic {{drugs are}} viewed with {{suspicion}} by doctors. For example, warfarin (Coumadin) has a narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>window</b> and requires frequent blood tests {{to make sure}} patients {{do not have a}} subtherapeutic or a toxic level. A study performed in Ontario showed that replacing Coumadin with generic warfarin was safe, but many physicians are not comfortable with their patients taking branded generic equivalents. In some countries (for example, Australia) where a drug is prescribed under more than one brand name, doctors may choose not to allow pharmacists to substitute a brand different from the one prescribed unless the consumer requests it.|$|E

25|$|Since many tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes are}} silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, {{there have been}} attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must {{be incorporated into the}} genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its <b>therapeutic</b> <b>window.</b> These pitfalls have {{led to the development of}} antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{theophylline}} {{is complicated}} by its interaction with various drugs and {{by the fact that}} it has a narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>window.</b> Its use must be monitored by direct measurement of serum theophylline levels to avoid toxicity. [...] It can also cause nausea, diarrhea, increase in heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, and CNS excitation (headaches, insomnia, irritability, dizziness and lightheadedness). Seizures can also occur in severe cases of toxicity, and are considered to be a neurological emergency. Its toxicity is increased by erythromycin, cimetidine, and fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin. It can reach toxic levels when taken with fatty meals, an effect called dose dumping. [...] Theophylline toxicity can be treated with beta blockers. [...] In addition to seizures, tachyarrhythmias are a major concern.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) has a short <b>therapeutic</b> time <b>window</b> {{for administration}} (3  h) and carries {{a risk of}} promoting intracerebral hemorrhage. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate a <b>therapeutic</b> time <b>window</b> and frequency of hemorrhagic region by treatment with Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenol- 7 (SMTP- 7). Thrombotic occlusion was induced by transfer of acetic acid-induced thrombus at the right common carotid artery into the brain of mice. Infarction area, neurological score, edema percentage, and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) were determined as the index of the efficacy of SMTP- 7. In order to evaluate the mechanism of SMTP- 7, plasmin activities and the expressions of interleukin (IL) - 1 β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL- 6 mRNA were examined. SMTP- 7 (0. 1, 1, 10  mg/kg) dose dependently reduced infarction area, neurological score, and edema percentage. Additionally, its <b>therapeutic</b> time <b>window</b> was longer than that of t-PA, a high-molecular-weight compound. In addition, little hemorrhagic region was induced by treatment with SMTP- 7. SMTP- 7 showed plasmin activity in vivo and caused a decreased CBF to recover. Furthermore, the expressions of inflammatory cytokine mRNA (IL- 1 β, TNF-α, IL- 6) were increased by t-PA treatment 3  h after ischemia but were not induced by SMTP- 7 treatment. These results indicate that SMTP- 7 shows potential thrombolytic and anti-inflammatory effects as well as a wide <b>therapeutic</b> time <b>window</b> and little hemorrhagic region compared with that of t-PA. Therefore, this novel low-molecular-weight compound may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cerebral infarction...|$|R

50|$|Immunotoxins {{consisting}} of a monoclonal antibody linked to saporin have been developed and evaluated in formal clinical trials in patients with leukaemia and lymphoma in the UK and Germany.

During the past 15 years the research group of Dr David Flavell at Southampton General Hospital in the UK have been investigating various ways of improving the potency and widening the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>window</b> for saporin-based immunotoxins thereby opening up new possibilities for this class of drug.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{property of}} hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{is the ability}} to self-renew. This is a complex process involving multiple signal transduction cascades which control the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation through transcriptional networks. Key activators/regulators of self-renewal include chemokines, cytokines and morphogens which are expressed in the bone marrow niche, either in a paracrine or autocrine fashion, and modulate stem cell behaviour. Increasing evidence suggests that the downstream signaling pathways induced by these ligands converge at multiple levels providing a degree of redundancy in steady state hematopoiesis. Here we will focus on how these pathways cross-talk to regulate HSC self-renewal highlighting potential <b>therapeutic</b> <b>windows</b> which could be targeted to prevent leukemic stem cell self-renewal in myeloid malignancies...|$|R

40|$|During the hyperacute {{stage of}} ischemic stroke, recanalization {{is the only}} {{approved}} therapeutic approach to improve outcome but {{is only applicable to}} the first few hours after symptom onset. There may, however, be other <b>therapeutic</b> <b>windows</b> to consider in the days to weeks after stroke. The inflammatory response after ischemic injury involves multiple intercon-nected processes both within the brain and in the periphery. During this same time period, there is a cascade of molecu-lar signaling events leading to angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and axonal sprouting. 1 Furthermore, neuroplasticity occurs not only at the molecular and cellular level within the peri-infarct zone, but also in areas remote from the infarct. Certain types of stem and progenitor cells represent a unique category of therapeutic opportunities because they may attenuate the postischemic proinflammatory response and may also engage...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose—Asiatic acid (AA) {{has been}} shown to {{attenuate}} cerebral infarction in a mouse model of focal ischemia and shows promise as a neuroprotective stroke therapy. To facilitate translation of these findings to clinical studies, we determined pharmacokinetics, a dose–response relationship, the <b>therapeutic</b> time <b>window,</b> and efficacy using multiple stroke models. We also explored potential mechanisms of action. Methods—Escalating doses of intravenous AA were administered and serum concentrations were measured at multiple time points for the pharmacokinetic studies. Subsequently, a dose–response relationship was determined followed by administration at different intervals after the onset of ischemia to establish a <b>therapeutic</b> time <b>window</b> for neuroprotection. Outcome measurements included both histological and behavioral. Mitochondrial function and matrix metalloproteinase activity in controls and treated rats were also determined. Results—The pharmacokinetic studies showed that AA (75 mg/kg) has a half-life of 2. 0 hours. AA significantly decreased infarct volume and improved neurological outcome even when administration was at time points up to 12 hours after the onset of ischemia. Infarct volume was also significantly decreased in female rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats. AA attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced matrix metalloproteinase- 9 induction. Conclusions—Our study shows AA is effective against multiple models of focal ischemia, has a long <b>therapeutic</b> time <b>window,</b> and is also effective in females and hypertensive animals. AA may mediate neuroprotection by protectin...|$|R
