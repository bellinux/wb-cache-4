40|$|Banks play an {{important}} role in the financial system contributing to efficient and well-functioning <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and risk between those in excess (savers) and those in need (borrowers) of money. In this role banks themselves are exposed to risks, which they have developed risk management practices to handle. Traditionally, financial risks, like interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risks, have been the most important and typical ones for banking operations. An appropriate management of financial risks has therefore been essential for the profitability and growth prospects of the bank. However, lately the risk environment of banks has changed considerably. Banks are operating in new markets, with new products and services, and under much tougher competition domestically as well as internationally. In this paper we are stressing the vital importance for the single bank to have a much more sophisticated and well-structured approach to risk management than it had fifteen years ago. Our main focus is on how banking objectives such as profitability and growth will govern risk management and how these objectives are made operational into the management of those assets and liabilities exposed to changes in market prices – particularly foreign exchange and interest rates – and in customer repayments of loans. Just as the new Basel Accord for international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards, we do also consider how banks (should) manage operational risks.

40|$|Globalization is {{eroding the}} {{livelihoods}} of small farmers, {{a significant and}} vulnerable class, particularly in the developing world. The cost-price squeeze stemming from trade liberalization places farmers in a {{race to the bottom}} that leads to displacement, poverty, and environmental degradation. Scholars and activists have proposed that alternative trade initiatives offer a unique opportunity to reverse this trend by harnessing the power of the markets to reward producers of goods with embedded superior cultural, environmental, and social values. Alternative trade via certification schemes have become a de facto prescription for any location where {{there is a need to}} conciliate economic interest with conservation imperatives. ^ Partnerships among commodity production farmers, elite manufacturers and wealthy northern consumers/activists do not necessarily have win-win outcomes. Paradoxically, the partnerships of farmers with external agencies have unexpected results. These partnerships develop into dependent relationships that become unsustainable in the absence of further <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> The institutions born of these partnerships are fragile. When these fledging institutions fail, farmers are left in the same situation that they were before the partnership, with only minor improvements to show after spending considerable amounts of social and financial capital. ^ I hypothesize that these failures are born out of a belief in a universal understanding of sustainability. A discursive emphasis on consensus, equity and mutual benefit hides the fact that what for consumers it is a matter of choice, for producers is a matter of survival. The growth in consumers’ demand for certified products creates a race for farmers to meet these standards. My findings suggest that this race generates economically perverse effects. First, producers enter into a certification treadmill. Second, the local need for economic sustainability is ignored. Third, commodity based alternative trade schemes increase the exposure of communities to global shocks. I conclude by calling for a careful reassessment of sustainable development projects that promote certification schemes. The designers and implementers of these programs must include farmers’ agenda in the planning of these programs. ...|$|E

This policy require <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and know-how from the rich to the poor countries, structural changes in the world economy leading to a mew international division of labour supported by appropriate trade policies. The experience of the socialist countries, and especially of the Soviet Union, with regard to the methods and technique of planning used in the past period of administrative planning had, for various reasons, a limited value for the developing countries. The highly centralized and detailed policy which characterized this period i. a. limited the transferability of the planning practice of the East to the South. Another reason why the significance of Soviet experience in that period was limited, was the policy of economic autarchy. With the end of the period of administrative economic policy in the East the economic reforms which have already taken place, or which are at the moment in execution give greater freedom to individual enterprises and aim at influencing their decisions in a more indirect manner. These changes have lead to a greater interest in the correct determination of the main outlines of economic development. The problems of the choice of an optimum rate of growth and optimum proportions in the economic structure have now come more to the foreground. New criteria are being sought for measuring the effectiveness of new investments. In the field of international trade, the principles for an international division of labour, international co-operation and planning are being studied and elaborated-. It is therefore understandable that the developing countries automatically turn their eyes towards the development efforts of socialist countries. But the problems and methods of development planning have a general character and are becoming common to the countries of the East, South and of the West. The actual choice of instruments of economic policy, however, might differ. The fact that the programming methods of East and West are also showing more similarities is something that the author should like to regard as a result of the universality, that is characterisic of every scientific method.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Annual Inquiry into Foreign Direct Investment (AFDI) collects financial data concerning Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The survey is conducted in two parts: the inward FDI relates to foreign investment into the UK from foreign parent or subsidiary companies, while the outward FDI relates to investment by UK-based companies to their overseas parents or subsidiary companies. In particular, the AFDI surveys UK companies about their relationship with oversees affiliates in terms of flows of investment, earnings from investment and international investment positions. Companies are restricted to those where the foreign investment amounts to at least 10 percent of the ordinary shares or voting power. Two files are available for each year: for inward and outward FDI, respectively. Data on earnings for subsidiaries and branches are available, as well as transactions between UK companies and their foreign subsidiaries or parent companies, including <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> These data are useful to researchers who wish to analyse the relationship between UK companies and overseas-based parent companies or subsidiaries. The data are also useful for broader research into firm-level activity and foreign direct investment. Surveys are sent to enterprise group 'heads' (i. e. the headquarters of a company, which in turn may own a number of smaller companies) based in the UK. The register from which the firms are sampled comes from sources including HM Customs and Revenue, Dunn and Bradstreet's 'Worldbase' system, and ONS inquiries on Acquisitions and Mergers. Sampling is stratified {{and based on the}} value of the net investment position of the foreign affiliates (outward FDI) or the UK group (inward FDI). The sample is heavily weighted towards larger enterprise groups, which account {{for the vast majority of}} FDI assets. The largest firms all receive the survey forms, while only a proportion of the smaller firms receive the forms. The sample is rotated each year for the smaller firms. Data are collected on both the UK company and its foreign affiliate(s), which may be the overseas-based parent company or an overseas-based subsidiary. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. For the third edition (January 2016), all data and documentation has been updated. This includes the addition of 2012 and 2013 data files and documentation. Main Topics : For each company in the survey, information is collected on their foreign affiliate(s) with regard to: country and industry of operation percentage of equity held (either by the UK company in its foreign subsidiary, or by the foreign parent company in its UK company) operating profits (of the UK company and its affiliate) transactions and flows of equity capital (e. g. payments made to the UK by its foreign parent company, or by the UK to its foreign subsidiary) acquisitions and disposals of equity capital (by the foreign parent to its UK subsidiary, or by the UK company to its foreign subsidiary) levels of investment (by the foreign parent to its UK subsidiary, or by the UK company to its foreign subsidiary), including: reinvestment of earnings; capital reserves; loans; current account balances </ul...|$|E

In particular, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> production know-how improves overall productivity of FDI-receiving firms and to some extent also that of the other firms due to spillovers. The present note uses a small panel of Austrian manufacturing sectors and investigates this hypothesis empirically.

Thus, the job creation potential of FDI highlighted in previous studies is likely to be overestimated. ...|$|R
60|$|This {{equalizing}} process, commonly {{described as}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from one employment to another, {{is not necessarily the}} onerous, slow, and almost impracticable operation which it is very often represented to be.

In a rapidly progressive state <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> the adjustment often takes place by means of the new accumulations of each year, which direct themselves in preference toward the more thriving trades. Even when a real <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> is necessary, {{it is by no means}} implied that any of those who are engaged in the unprofitable employment relinquish business and break up their establishments. The numerous and multifarious channels of credit through which, in commercial nations, unemployed capital diffuses itself over the field of employment, flowing over in greater abundance to the lower levels, are the means by which the equalization is accomplished. The process consists in a limitation by one class of dealers or producers and an extension by the other of that portion of their business which is carried on with borrowed capital.|$|R
