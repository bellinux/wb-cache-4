60|$|We were {{entering}} upon our third view of Genoa with the zest of our first, and I {{was glad to}} find {{there were so many}} things I had left unseen or had forgotten. First of all the Campo Santo allured me, and I went at once to verify the impressions of former years in a tram following the bed of a <b>torrential</b> <b>river</b> which was now dry except in the pools where the laundresses were at work, picturesquely as always in Italy. But here they were not alone the worthy theme of art; their husbands and fathers, and perhaps even their fiances, were at work with them, not, indeed, washing the linen, but spreading to dry it in snowy spaces over the clean gravel. On either bank of the stream newly finished or partly finished apartment-houses testified to the prosperity of the city, which seemed to be growing everywhere, and it would not be too bold to imagine this a favorite quarter because of its convenience to the Cam-po Santo. Already in the early forenoon our train was carrying people to that popular resort, who seemed to be intending to spend the day there. Some had wreaths and flowers, and were clearly sorrowing friends of the dead; others, with their guide-books, were as plainly mere sight-seers, and these were Italians as well as strangers, gratifying what seems the universal passion for cemeteries. In our own villages the graveyards are the favorite Sunday haunt of the young people and the scene of their love-making; and it has been the complaint of English visitors to our cities that the first thing their hosts took them to see was the cemetery. They did not realize that this was often the thing best worth showing them, for our feeble aesthetic instincts found their first expression in the attempt to dignify or beautify the homes of the dead. Each mourner grieved in marble as fitly as he knew how, and, if there was sometimes a rivalry in vaults and shafts, the effect was of a collective interest which all could feel. Sometimes it was touching, sometimes it was revolting; and in Italy it is not otherwise. The Campo Santo of San Miniato at Florence, the Campo Santo at Bologna, the Campo Santo wherever else you find it, you find of one quality with the Campo Santo at Genoa. It makes you the helpless confidant of family pride, of bruised and lacerated love, of fond aspiration, of religious longing, of striving faith, of foolish vanity and vulgar pretence, but, if the traveller would read the local civilization aright, he cannot do better than go to study it there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} the valley width for discontinuities of sediment transport in natural stream channels. The results may be summarized as follows: 1) ln <b>torrential</b> <b>rivers.</b> deposition or erosion depend mostly on the sediment supply. not on the magnitude of the flow discharge. 2 lWide valley floors of streams are depositional spaces where the excess sediment from the upper stream area is temporarily deposited. In the erosional process that follows, the sediment runs off down stream in a way that can be explained by an exponent i a 1 process...|$|R

50|$|Azbukovica is a {{highland}} area {{in western}} Serbia, {{on the border}} with Bosnia and Herzegovina. River Drina separates Azbukovica from municipalities of Srebrenica and Bratunac. Borders: to the northwest - municipality of Mali Zvornik, to the north - municipality of Krupanj, to the northeastern - municipality of Osečina, to the east - municipality of Valjevo, and to the south - municipality of Bajina Bašta. The highest peak is Tornička Bobija 1272 meters high on the mountain Bobija. Several <b>torrential</b> <b>rivers,</b> flowing into the Drina, intersect Azbukovica. The most famous rivers are Trešnjica and Ljuboviđa. In the late Ottoman period, the region was administratively part of the Sokol nahiya (Sokolska nahija).|$|R

50|$|Near the Ecuadorian frontier, the Andes Mountains {{divide into}} three distinct, roughly {{parallel}} chains, called cordilleras, that extend northeastward {{almost to the}} Caribbean Sea. Altitudes reach more than 18700 ft, and mountain peaks are permanently covered with snow. The elevated basins and plateaus of these ranges have a moderate climate that provides pleasant living conditions and in many places enables farmers to harvest twice a year. <b>Torrential</b> <b>rivers</b> {{on the slopes of}} the mountains produce a large hydroelectric power potential and add their volume to the navigable rivers in the valleys. In the late 1980s, approximately 78 percent of the country's population lived in the Andean highlands.|$|R

50|$|Mountains. This {{is a long}} barrier made up of {{abruptly}} rising mountains {{parallel to}} the sea, which {{are part of the}} Cantabrian Mountains. The mountains are mostly made of limestone with karst topography, and occupy most of Cantabria's area. They form deep valleys running north-south. The <b>torrential</b> <b>rivers</b> are short, fast flowing and of great eroding power, so the slopes are steep. The valleys define different natural regions, delimited physically by the intervening mountain ranges: Liébana, Saja-Nansa, Besaya, Pas-Pisueña, Miera, Asón-Gándara, Campoo. To the 'mountain' region belongs the Escudo Range, a mountain range of 600 to 1,000 metres high that covers 15 or 20 km in a parallel line to the coast in the West part of Cantabria.|$|R
25|$|The Kuntipuzha River drains {{the entire}} 15km {{length of the}} park {{from north to south}} into the Bharathapuzha River. Kuntipuzha River divides the park into a narrow eastern sector of width 2 {{kilometers}} and a wide western sector of 5 kilometers. The river is characterized by its crystal clear water and perennial nature. The main tributaries of the river, Kunthancholapuzha, Karingathodu, Madrimaranthodu, Valiaparathodu and Kummaathanthodu originate on the upper slopes of {{the eastern side of the}} valley. The river is uniformly shallow, with no flood plains or meanders. Its bed falls from 1,861 m to 900 m over a distance of 12km, the last 8km being particularly level with a fall of only 60 m.

40|$|ABSTRACT Alternate {{bars are}} liable to be formed on the <b>river</b> bed of <b>torrential</b> <b>rivers</b> on {{alluvial}} fans so that meandering and local scouring due to the bar formation often resulted in damage to channel works. Control measures against bars which have detrimental effects on channels are studied by means of hydraulic experiments, and cross dykes such as bed girdle and ground sill are proved to be effective. Cross-dyke arrangement, footing depth and height of revetment are discussed taking bar formation mechanisms into consideration. (a) The correlation between the height of alternate bars Hsmax and the scouring depth #Hsmax is iHsmax = 0. 8 Hsmax. (b) The height of bars varies {{in proportion to the}} interval between cross dykes. The optimum interval is approximately twice the channel width in the region of 5 <B//Q< 10, where B is the channel width and Q the designed discharge...|$|R
40|$|Reasons {{for lack}} of {{hydrological}} studies in mountainous regions are: absence of hydrological measurements {{and the fact that}} measurements were not continuous. However, as mentioned areas are basic sources of fresh, unpolluted and useful water, it is necessary to carry out water regime researches and continuous measurements. Surface amount of water in Skrapež riverbed was analyzed, as well as its regime and water balance. Water management problems were pointed out as well. This paper discusses problems connected to decreasing of water amount in the last 20 years of analyzed period, variations of discharge, threats to economy in periods of both low and high water, and also points out the torrential character of the river. The possibilities of water usage from previously unstudied Skrapež sub basins are pointed out as well. Research and utilization of these sub basins provided that high water quality is preserved, would lead to high level of solving the problems of water supply, irrigation and <b>torrential</b> <b>rivers...</b>|$|R
