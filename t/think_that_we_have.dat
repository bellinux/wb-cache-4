But now with the undeniable upsurge of scientific research, we cannot continue {{to rely on the}} mere fact that we have learned how to teach what is known. We must learn to teach the best attitude to what is not yet known. This also may take centuries to acquire but we cannot escape this new challenge, nor do we want to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{the tenth}} issue of McSweeney's Quarterly was guest edited by Michael Chabon. Published as McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales, it is a {{collection}} of [...] "pulp fiction" [...] stories written by such current well-known authors as Stephen King, Nick Hornby, Aimee Bender and Dave Eggers. Explaining his vision for the project, Chabon wrote in the introduction, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> forgotten how much fun reading a short story can be, and I hope that if nothing else, this treasury goes some small distance toward reminding us of that lost but fundamental truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bopp later {{acknowledged}} the chance discovery, [...] The following morning at 8:25am {{the office of}} Brian Marsden, director of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, called him back to confirm the sighting was indeed a comet. The comet was given the formal name Comet 1995 O1, and three days later its full title C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), designating the first comet found during the second half-month of July 1995. Hale's name precedes Bopp's because his was the first report to arrive. It is uncertain {{who was the first}} to discover it, as they both spotted it at around the same time. The following day Hale phoned Bopp to introduce himself with the words, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> something in common." [...] When they met at a conference two months later, Bopp admitted to the press that Hale [...] "turned out to be a nice guy." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{gave him}} the hand which Arthur had seized upon. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> none of us before seen a smile so {{dazzling}} as hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{better not}} do so. If I {{understand}} the bishop aright, he wishes that I should take some {{step in the}} matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> talked {{enough of}} serious affairs tonight," [...] he said. [...] "I shall {{challenge}} Sir Edward {{to a game}} of billiards." ...|$|E
6000|$|Adam. <b>Think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not fallen so! By {{the hope}} [...] And aspiration, by {{the love and}} faith, [...] We do exceed the stature of this angel.|$|E
6000|$|... "And to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got Bob {{out here}} with us!" [...] his wife said, without taking any notice of the last words. [...] "What will uncle say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{better take}} only nine. If we {{overload}} her she will row so heavily <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall {{be a long}} time overhauling them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think!" [...] he said; [...] "why, I {{think what}} his {{companion}} <b>thinks,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{been listening to}} the ravings of a half-drunken man. The fellow stunk of brandy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did," [...] he {{answered}} gravely. [...] "My name is Mostyn Ray--but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better have some light. I {{am going to}} get one of the motor lamps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doubtless {{you thought}} you saw them, David," [...] {{answered}} Hugh, adding with meaning, [...] "and {{it is not always}} well to talk of things we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{been very}} considerate, Mr. Brooks," [...] Selina remarked, with an {{engaging}} smile. [...] "We gave up our usual dinner this evening as papa {{had to leave}} so early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} take our lives at once," [...] said Big Tim fiercely, [...] "else {{we will begin}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had the mischance {{to fall into the}} hands of cowardly squaws." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true, Dave. But {{it makes}} me mad to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> such a fortune as that right in our hands and then let it get away from us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must have}} it," [...] said Annie Rich, decidedly. [...] "It {{would never do}} to let them <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> given up a good time just because they wouldn't join us." ...|$|R
60|$|Having told me {{the name}} of Mr. Candy's assistant, Betteredge {{appeared}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> wasted enough of our time on an insignificant subject. He resumed the perusal of Rosanna Spearman's letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] {{the general}} said, as the {{receipts}} were handed over; [...] "come along, lads, {{the business is}} over, and I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any more to say to Mr. Weale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jump in here, Frank," [...] he said, {{leading the}} way to the sledge. [...] "They must all <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> gone mad, and we shall have a crowd round us in a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't you all <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a {{great need}} to Cry to our God {{to put it in}} the hearts of our greassous Queen and her Members of Parlerment to grant us free bread!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] whispered Peter in English {{across the}} table to Castell--"now I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> best go to bed, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned much from this holy spy--as I take him to be--and told little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{doctor has}} {{returned}} from his business rounds sooner than was expected, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better join the party," [...] I remarked, and made a bee line for the stoep, Marnham following me.|$|R
60|$|Here {{we decided}} to halt, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had a hard day of it, and, if the truth were known, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> all given up hope of {{overtaking}} the launch other than by the merest accident.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bridge!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What {{brings you}} back here? Don't {{you know that}} you endanger us as well as {{yourself}} by being seen here? General Villa will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been harboring you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Far be {{the thought}} from us, most kind friend and virtuous man," [...] I answered. [...] "But, as it chances, your story {{is very much}} our own, and we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{experience}} of this same priestess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father!" [...] he said thoughtfully. [...] "Yes, I {{see what}} you mean! He will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been a little precipitate, eh? He will require a little {{time in order to}} learn to love me, you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{thunder and}} {{lightning}} must have scared the brute away. There's your steward, Meldrum. The sooner <b>we</b> <b>have</b> breakfast {{and get back}} to the island the better, or some of those niggers might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been frightened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{thou art}} rested, Zoola," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better carry the white lord from this place, {{for the two}} witch-women have gone, and I can find no more oil to fill the lamps." ...|$|R
6000|$|Martin's great form loomed in the doorway. [...] "The Vrouw Jansen has fled away," [...] he said, [...] "and {{the street}} is quite quiet now, so I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better be moving before any see us, my masters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, my friend," [...] said he, [...] "our day's {{work has}} been quite long enough. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{gathered}} all that we can. It's a long walk to the school, and the sooner we get started the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{thank you}} very much," [...] I answered, [...] "we must {{get back to the}} wagon or our {{servants}} will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> come to grief. Perhaps you will accept the wildebeeste if it is of any use to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid," [...] he said. [...] "I am {{not going}} to ask you any questions. I {{am not going}} to ask for any explanations. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> passed all that. It is of the future I wanted to speak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That we are not, Miss Netta," [...] he agreed. [...] "I did <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> gained {{something}} when we traced him to that house on Pentonville Hill, {{but it does}} not seem that anything has come of it, after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Duchess <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better all go {{into the}} box," [...] she said. [...] "We have two stalls as well, but as Dicky is not here there is really room for five. Will you get some programmes, Sir Charles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{would do}} well," [...] Ritzer said, [...] "and will shorten the way by two hundred miles. But after leaving Passau, I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better {{not follow the}} direct road until we get to Ratisbon.|$|R
