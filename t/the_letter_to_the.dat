5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Knox sent <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen Regent, he {{suddenly}} {{announced that he}} felt his duty was to return to Geneva. In the previous year on 1 November 1555, the congregation in Geneva had elected Knox as their minister {{and he decided to}} take up the post. He wrote a final letter of advice to his supporters and left Scotland with his wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in Geneva on 13 September 1556.|$|E
5|$|In April 1918, {{after the}} German-Russian Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Austrian Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin {{made a speech}} attacking {{incoming}} French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau as being the main obstacle to a peace favouring the Central Powers. Clemenceau was incensed and, after seeing the Emperor Charles's letter of 24 March 1917, had it published. For a while, the life of Sixtus {{appeared to be in}} danger, and there were even fears that Germany might occupy Austria. Czernin persuaded Charles to send a 'Word of Honour' to Austria's allies saying that Sixtus had not been authorised to show <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French Government, that Belgium had not been mentioned, and that Clemenceau had lied about the mentioning of Alsace. Czernin had actually been in contact with the German Embassy throughout the whole crisis and attempted to persuade the Emperor to step down because of the Affair. After failing to do so, Czernin resigned as Foreign Minister.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads {{was part of}} a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E
5|$|On 13 January, Brown {{received}} {{a request from}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory for the Missouri to proceed through a channel in which the United States Navy had strewn acoustic cables {{as part of an}} ongoing project that aimed to identify ships by their propeller signatures. The request was entirely optional, but as the captain was preoccupied with the details of the upcoming sortie to Cuba he gave the letter little attention and instead referred the matter to his operations officer, Commander John R. Millett, who in turn referred <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship's navigator, Lieutenant Commander Frank G. Morris.|$|E
25|$|In December 1166, Alexander {{wrote to}} the English bishops that he was sending papal legates a latere to England to hear the various cases. Although later writers {{on both sides of}} the {{controversy}} claimed that there was to be no appeal from the legates' decisions, nowhere in the documents announcing their appointment was any such limitation mentioned. Alexander wrote two letters, one to each of the main combatants. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king stressed that the pope had forbidden the archbishop from escalating the dispute until the legates had decided the issues, and that the legates were to absolve the excommunicated once they arrived in England. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archbishop, however, stressed that the pope had begged the king to restore Becket to Canterbury, and instead of commanding Becket to refrain from further escalation, merely advised the archbishop to restrain himself from hostile moves. Meanwhile, John of Oxford had returned to England from a mission to Rome, and was proclaiming that the legates were to depose Becket, and supposedly showed papal letters confirming this to Foliot. The pope {{wrote to the}} papal legates complaining that John of Oxford's actions had harmed the pope's reputation, but never claimed that John of Oxford was lying.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Euroa robbery, Donald Cameron and Police Superintendent John Sadleir each {{received}} {{a copy of}} Kelly’s letter which he had signed 'Edward Kelly, enforced outlaw' and in which he attempted to tell {{his side of the}} events leading up to the killing of three policemen at Stringybark Creek in October 1878. The police advised against releasing <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press for publication but reporters were permitted to read it. Newspaper accounts of the contents of Kelly's letter ranged from dismissive to sympathetic.|$|E
25|$|As {{a further}} precaution, he also sent letters to Elbląg (Elbing) with {{a request for}} {{additional}} supplies and 20cannons. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Polish king was intercepted by the knights. Sigismund, however, learned of the threat through other channels and the garrison of the town was expanded to 200 when a unit of infantry, {{under the leadership of}} the Czech commander Henryk Peryk of Janowice arrived. Another 700cavalry under Rotmistrz Zbigniew Slupecki showed up soon after. Further supplies from Elbing, consisting of lead, salt and 16more artillery pieces arrived in early February.|$|E

After Kelly’s trial in October 1880 and execution on 11 November 1880 the letter was returned to Living and it remained in private hands until it was donated to the State Library of Victoria in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Other {{researchers}} believe that some individual(s) may have been behind its origins, being followed by imitators later on. Spring-heeled Jack was widely considered {{not to be a}} supernatural creature, but rather one or more persons with a macabre sense of humour. This idea matches the contents of <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lord Mayor, which accused a group of young aristocrats as the culprits, after an irresponsible wager. A popular rumour circulating as early as 1840 pointed to an Irish nobleman, the Marquess of Waterford, as the main suspect. Haining suggested this may have been due to him having previously had bad experiences with women and police officers.|$|E
25|$|However, in June, forces {{loyal to}} Constantius {{captured}} {{the city of}} Aquileia on the north Adriatic coast, an event that threatened to cut Julian {{off from the rest}} of his forces, while Constantius's troops marched towards him from the east. Aquileia was subsequently besieged by 23,000 men loyal to Julian. All Julian could do was sit it out in Naissus, the city of Constantine's birth, waiting for news and writing letters to various cities in Greece justifying his actions (of which only <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Athenians has survived in its entirety). Civil war was avoided only by the death on November 3 of Constantius, who, in his last will, is alleged by some sources to have recognized Julian as his rightful successor.|$|E

However, he then read <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Assembly, which ordered it printed and circulated.

25|$|The debacle {{over the}} final section of NY214 dragged into 1953 and soon 1954, when the {{residents}} of Lanesville pressed New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey to take action on the stalled project. The federal appropriation of aid would expire on June 30, 1955 and the committee noted that the state had been making empty promises since February 1952. They pressured Dewey {{to take steps to}} expedite the project, as the Public Works department had been making excuses from federal aid, to engineer shortages, to lack of money, approval by Greene County and that the state must match the amount of the federal government provided. By May, the committee turned their requests to United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower for his support on the highway.
