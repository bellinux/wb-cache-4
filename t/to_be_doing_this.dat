However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. [...] But because you shoot out of sequence, it's often just 'Turn left, cross the room, okay, that's a wrap.' And you're done. [...] Yeah, it's very odd. Because suddenly it was all over, just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we're never going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> again.|$|E
500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did {{not seem to}} go well at the beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing.

[...] The track was intended for an album release on the Modern label; that project was canceled and Cole's [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] and another Lambert production: [...] "I Live For Your Love", were picked up by EMI-Manhattan Records to appear on Cole's 1987 album Everlasting.

The great {{observer}} was not observant of things that other people observed. Neither he nor Flora, occupied with matters of more spiritual importance, could tell, offhand, for example, on which hand a wedding-ring was worn. They had talked enough of Becket and the Tods to produce the impression on Flora's mind that one day or another two young people would arrive in her house on a visit; but she had begun a poem called 'Dionysus at the Well,' and Felix himself had plunged into a satiric allegory entitled 'The Last of the Laborers.' Nedda, therefore, walked alone; but at her side went always an invisible companion. In that long, imaginary walking-out she gave her thoughts and the whole of her heart, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> never surprised her, who, before, had not given them whole to anything. A bee knows the first summer day and clings intoxicated to its flowers; so did Nedda know and cling. She wrote him two letters and he wrote her one.

"O! my lord," [...] {{said the}} soldier, {{in a sort}} of enthusiasm, [...] "their {{behaviour}} on pay-day might be a pattern to all Europe--no borrowings, no lendings, no offsets no arrears--all balanced and paid like a banker's book. The quarters, too, are excellent, and the allowances unchallengeable; but then, sir, they are a preceese, scrupulous people, and will allow nothing for peccadilloes. So that if a boor complains of a broken head, or a beer-seller of a broken can, or a daft wench does but squeak loud enough to be heard above her breath, a soldier of honour shall be dragged, not before his own court-martial, who can best judge of and punish his demerits, but before a base mechanical burgo-master, who shall menace him with the rasp-house, the cord, and what not, as if he were one of their own mean, amphibious, twenty-breeched boors. So not being able to dwell longer among those ungrateful plebeians, who, although unable to defend themselves by their proper strength, will nevertheless allow the noble foreign cavalier who engages with them nothing beyond his dry wages, which no honourable spirit will put in competition with a liberal license and honourable countenance, I resolved to leave the service of the Mynheers.
