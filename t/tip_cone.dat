The diameter size, the flow channel geometry, and fluid impedance are the key factors affecting the ejection capacity. A novel low-cost fabrication method of microglass nozzle involving four steps is developed in this work. In the first heating step, the glass pipette is melted and pulled. Then, the second heating step {{is to determine the}} <b>tip</b> <b>cone</b> angle and modify the flow channel geometry. The desired included angle is usually of 30 ~ 45 degrees.

40|$|A methane-air {{premixed}} flame {{with and}} equivalence ratio of 1. 25 was simulated {{with a model}} including 91 pairs of elementary reactions occurring among 29 species. In this second part, the flame structures {{at the base of}} the flame and at inner and outer <b>cone</b> <b>tips</b> are discussed. Around the burner rim, the entrainment of air from the surroundings is seen to be the main reason for the activation of chemical reactions by promoting large production of O atoms and OH radicals. As a consequence, the rate of heat release there is very large, allowing the flame temperature to increase steeply and the flame to be held on the burner. At the inner <b>cone</b> <b>tip,</b> also, chemical reactions proceed with large rates, due to flame stretch and to preferential diffusion of H 2. H 2 is consumed there, so that the fuel burning at the inner <b>cone</b> <b>tip</b> is composed of a mixture of CH 4 +H 2. CH 3 radicals remain above the inner <b>cone</b> <b>tip</b> and, around the tip of the outer cone, oxidation via C 1 route leads to formation of CO, which is oxidized into CO 2, as in any other point of the outer cone. H 2, however, is formed by reduction of water above the inner <b>cone</b> <b>tip.</b> This H 2 formation continues even within and above the outer <b>cone</b> <b>tip,</b> so that respect to H 2 the outer cone is found to have no tip...|$|R

Computational interferograms are pictorially analogous to optical interferograms, and examples showing the fringe pattern for the flow about a sharp <b>tip</b> <b>cone</b> in a supersonic air stream are presented. To ascertain the effect of unsteady behavior, local density disturbances {{are added to the}} steady state flow field. This introduces irregularities to the computational interferogram like those seen in the optical interferograms. These theoretical disturbances can be varied in geometry, density description, translated with time, and strengthened or dissipated. The accuracy of computational interferometry relies on the accuracy of the theoretical density descriptions and therefore, it provides a way of verifying existing models of flow fields, especially those containing unsteady or turbulent behavior. In addition to being a unique method of flow visualization, computational interferometry can be used to develop and modify theories or numerical solutions to both simple and complex flow fields. The presented research is a general description of this process...|$|E
40|$|Precision {{measurements}} of a nanoscale sample surface using an {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) require a precise quantitative knowledge of the 3 D tip shape. Blind tip reconstruction (BTR), established by Villarrubia, gives an outer bound with larger errors if the tip characterizer is not appropriate. In order to explore the errors of BTR, a series of simulation experiments based on a conical model were carried out. The results show that, to reconstruct the tip precisely, the cone angle of the tip characterizer must be smaller {{than that of the}} tip. Furthermore, the errors decrease {{as a function of the}} <b>tip</b> <b>cone</b> angle and increase linearly with the sample radius of curvature, irrespective of the tip radius of curvature. In particular, for sharp (20 nm radius) and blunt (80 nm radius) tips, the radius of curvature of the tip characterizer must be smaller than 5 nm. Based on these simulation results, a local error model of BTR was established. The maximum deviation between the errors derived from the model and the simulated experiments is 1. 22 nm. Compared with the lateral resolution used in the above simulated experiments (4 nm/pixel), it is valid to ignore the deviations and consider the local error model of BTR is indeed in quantitative agreement with the simulation results. Finally, two simulated ideal structures are proposed here, together with their corresponding real samples. The simulation results show they are suitable for BTR...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} AFM probe {{geometry}} on diffusion to micrometer-scale reactive (electrode) interfaces is considered. A disk-shaped substrate electrode {{was held at}} a potential to reduce a species of interest (aqueous Ru(NH 3) (6) (3 +)) at a diffusion-control led rate and the current response during AFM imaging provided information on local mass transport to the interface. This approach reveals how the AFM probe influences diffusion to a reactive surface, which is of importance in more clearly delineating {{the conditions under which}} in-situ AFM can be treated as a noninvasive probe of surface processes involving mass transport (e. g., electrode reactions and crystal dissolution and growth). An assessment has been made of three types of probes: V-shaped silicon nitride contact mode probes; single beam silicon probes; and batch-fabricated scanning electrochemical-atomic force microscopy (SECM-AFM) probes. Two disk electrodes, (6. 1 mu m and 1. 6 mu m diameter) have been considered as substrates. The results indicate that conventional V-shaped contact mode probes are the most invasive and that the batch-fabricated SECM-AFM probes are the least invasive to diffusion at both of the substrates used herein. The experimental data are complemented by the development of simulations based on a simple 2 D model of the AFM probe and active surface site. The importance of probe parameters such as the cantilever size, <b>tip</b> <b>cone</b> height, and cone angle is discussed, and the implications of the results for studies in other areas, such as growth and dissolution processes, are considered briefly. ...|$|E

A scaled-down hollow cone with gold walls, a carbon tip and a curved hydrogen foil inside the cone has been considered. Proton acceleration is driven by a 1020 W·cm− 2 and 1  ps laser pulse focused on the hydrogen foil. Simulations show an important surface current at the cone walls which generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field is dragged by the quasi-neutral plasma formed by fast protons and co-moving electrons when they propagate towards the <b>cone</b> <b>tip.</b> As a result, a tens of kT Bz field is set up at the <b>cone</b> <b>tip,</b> which {{is strong enough to}} deflect the protons and increase the beam divergence substantially.

40|$|The fast {{ignition}} (FI) concept {{requires the}} generation of a compact, dense, pure fuel mass accessible to an external ignition source. The current baseline FI target is a shell fitted with a re-entrant cone extending to near its center. Conventional direct or indirect drive collapses the shell near the <b>tip</b> of the <b>cone</b> and then an ultra-intense laser pulse focused to the inside <b>cone</b> <b>tip</b> generates high-energy electrons to ignite the dense fuel. Theoretical investigations of this concept with a modest 2 -D calculational scheme have sparsely explored the large design space and the tradeoffs available to optimize compaction of the fuel and maintain {{the integrity of the}} cone. Experiments have generally validated the modeling while revealing additional complexities. Away from the cone, the shell collapses much as does a conventional implosion, generating a hot, low-density inner core plasma which exhausts out toward the <b>tip</b> of the <b>cone.</b> The hot, low-density inner core can impede the compaction of the cold fuel, lowering the implosion/burn efficiency and the gain, and jetting toward the <b>cone</b> <b>tip</b> can affect the cone integrity. Thicker initial fuel layers, lower velocity implosions, and drive asymmetries can lead to decreased efficiency in converting implosion kinetic energy into compression. Ignition and burn hydrodynamic studies have revealed strategies for generating additional convergence and compression in the FI context.

In our estimation, the shock traveling time can be delayed 20 – 30 ps by lower-Z material with larger areal density compared to the conventional gold flat tip.

Although it is possible that seed mass variation might be selected because it increases dispersal effectiveness, several factors - the consistent within-cone positional variation in seed mass, wing area, and wing loading; the dependence of seed mass, wing area, and wing loading on cone size; and the positive relationship between seed mass and wing area - suggest that variation is caused by constraints by scale size...|$|R

The noise could be varied in these tunnels from high levels, approaching those in conventional tunnels, to extremely low levels.
