5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was the Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special <b>tools,</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment.</b> The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E
