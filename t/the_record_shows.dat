5|$|Often in {{part because}} of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows</b> a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows,</b> {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E

Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E

25|$|Hebard was a {{tumbleweed}} of activity.

Only after the High Plain's long winter had retreated would conditions become favorable for Hebard's expeditions. Although <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows</b> that she sometimes strapped on snowshoes to continue her explorations in the winter. But even summer treks presented difficulties.

25|$|As Minister for Finance, Haughey on two {{occasions}} arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries (Germany and the United States), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to Irish punts and depositing them in the Exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional, because it effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making a currency speculation against his own currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General Eugene Francis Suttle, Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions. The debate was very short and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows</b> no understanding of the issue by the opposition finance spokesmen, O'Higgins for Fine Gael and Tully for Labour. The legislation was passed on 26 November 1969.|$|E
25|$|Limitations of mere outside {{technology}} on local battlefields. Gunpowder weapons, originally developed in China, were also introduced into native military systems over the centuries. In many {{areas such as}} Benin or Dahomey they sparked far-reaching changes, but in others they were of limited utility, or simply incorporated as supplements to an already established military structure. Outside technology was not the decisive factor in many conflicts. European artillery for example, while of unmistakable value in siege operations against well articulated structures such as gates and walls, were of limited utility against well placed African earthworks. Early European muskets greatly increased killing power but their slow-rate of fire (some three rounds per minute ir less, with effective ranges around 50 yards- according to one study) were unimpressive, and rendered musketeers vulnerable to the quick charges or arrow volleys of motivated opponents. Angola serves as a test bed in many ways for outside technology in African warfare, and the Portuguese attempted direct conquest with their own weapons, {{including the use of}} heavy body armor. However <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows</b> several Portuguese defeats, and in some cases where the Portuguese attempted to fight unsupported by African allies they were liquidated on the field of battle.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} of the good order of the house during the time of Richard de Morins; he would {{scarcely}} have been chosen twice to visit other houses unless he had ruled his own with care and diligence. During his forty years of office canons of Dunstable were at least five times elected priors to other monasteries of the order—at Caldwell, St. Frideswide's, Ashby and Coldnorton. Bishop Grosseteste visited the house once in 1236, not so much to inquire into the daily life of the priory as to investigate its title to several appropriate churches; but he exacted an oath on this occasion from all the canons individually, and one of them fled to Woburn rather than submit to it. The bishop came again in 1248, while Geoffrey of Barton was prior; when the cellarer, accused by many, fled before his coming to Merivale; but he {{does not seem to have}} found fault with the convent in general, and his next visit in 1250 was for purposes of his own. Archbishop Boniface came in 1253, but made no complaint. In 1274 Bishop Gravesend sent a canon of Lincoln to visit Dunstable, who left his corrections in writing; and in Advent of the same year he made a personal visitation. In November 1279 Bishop Sutton came and discharged his office 'strictly and without respect of persons.' The sub-prior and certain others were removed from their charge, and forbidden to hold office in future, and certain 'less useful members' of the household expelled; in May of the following year he deposed the prior, William le Breton, from all pastoral care. It seems most likely that these depositions were on account of mismanagement rather than for any personal failings; the great necessity and heavy debts of the house called for stringent measures, and William le Breton had shown himself (like Abbot Richard of Woburn in a similar case) unable to meet the difficulty. There is no sign of any other grave faults having been committed, nor of anything like luxurious living. The new prior, according to the bishop's advice, set himself to limit the expenses of the whole house and assigned a fixed income to the kitchen for the future; the deposed prior had a proper maintenance assigned to him at Ruxox. The canons seem to have borne no ill-will to Bishop Sutton for his corrections, and were ready on his next visit to their church (which was made not officially but only in passing) to praise him for his excellent sermon. Other visitations of his are mentioned in 1284, 1287, 1288, and 1293; the last was only to confer orders. Archbishop Peckham came in 1284, but found all well ('as the bishop had been there quite lately,' the chronicler naively remarks); and Archbishop Winchelsea in 1293. The only serious charge that could be laid to the door of the canons all through the thirteenth century was their inability to keep clear of debt; and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows</b> that this was often quite as much their misfortune as their fault. There are many incidental remarks of the chroniclers which serve to show that the tone of the house was thoroughly religious, and that the canons were faithful in keeping their rule. It will suffice to instance, early in the century, the generous treatment of the two young canons (one only a novice), who escaped by night through a window and went to join the Friars Minor at Oxford. They were indeed solemnly excommunicated and compelled to return; but after they had done their penance in the chapter house and had been absolved, they were allowed a year to consider the matter, and if after that time they preferred the stricter order, they were granted permission to depart; if not, they might remain at Dunstable. A good deal later than this, in 1283, the apologetic way in which the chronicler relates how the prior went out to dinner with John Durant is sufficient to show that the ordinary rules and customs of the order were not commonly broken.|$|E

500|$|Ford was {{a member}} of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding the Grand Rapids congressional {{district}} seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in The New York Times described him, Ford [...] "saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows</b> it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career." [...] Appointed to the House Appropriations Committee two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Ford described his philosophy as [...] "a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy." [...] Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a [...] "Congressman's Congressman".|$|E
500|$|Beginning in March 1876, former {{newspaper}} editor George Weston published letters asserting that bimetallism was {{mandated by the}} Constitution, and questioning how the Coinage Act had passed.

Bland (soon to be known as [...] "Silver Dick") told the House of Representatives, [...] "The act of February 12, 1873 was a fraud, because its title gave no clue to the real intent of the act. [...] <b>The</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows</b> that the act was stealthily passed, without reconsideration and without debate." [...] In 1878, Congressman Kelley, who had introduced the bill into the House, stated, [...] "I was ignorant of the fact it would demonetize the silver dollar".|$|E
500|$|In Mashpee, the First Circuit {{rejected}} the Mashpee's attempt {{to stay the}} litigation until the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) could adjudicate the tribe's petition for federal recognition. The court noted: [...] "The Department has never formally passed on the tribal status of the Mashpees or, so far as <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>shows,</b> any other group whose status was disputed. Therefore, the Department does not yet have prescribed procedures {{and has not been}} called on to develop special expertise in distinguishing tribes from other groups of Indians." [...] Yet, in 1978, the BIA had promulgated regulations establishing the criteria for federal recognition of tribes. In light of these new regulations, and their later use, the Second Circuit has held that the BIA retains [...] "primary jurisdiction" [...] over tribal recognition. In other words, Nonintercourse Act claims by unrecognized tribes must be stayed until the BIA is given a timely opportunity to adjudicate the tribe's petition for recognition. If the BIA rejects a tribe's petition, the tribe's Nonintercourse Act claim may be barred by collateral estoppel.|$|E

500|$|Living Proof {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics.

In a similar review, Post-Tribune newspaper felt the album [...] "should show just how essential Cher still is {{in the world of}} pop". Baby A. Gil, writer for The Philippine Star, praised the album as [...] "another rousing dancefest", while noting that Cher's singing was [...] "in full control and in better form than it was during her early days", calling it an [...] "excellent example" [...] that time can stand still. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was mostly positive, noting that [...] "each track pumps with melodies so thickly contagious that their hit potentials are essentially guaranteed", while even the album's weakest moments maintain the high-energy, club-ready pace. However, he also noted that Cher [...] "shamelessly revisits her proven hit formula with such fervent immodesty it's hard to believe three years have gone by". Entertainment Weeklys Jim Farber [...] gave a positive feedback, despite saying Cher's vocals seemed [...] "even more worked on than her face. But she still has feeling". Colm O'Hare from Irish magazine Hot Press exalted the album's international lead single [...] "The Music's No Good Without You", noting it uses the same voice effect from [...] "Believe", and said [...] "it's almost a 'Believe' Part Two proving that nothing succeeds like repetition".|$|E
