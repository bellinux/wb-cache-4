5000|$|His early {{theoretical}} work on {{determining the}} bandwidth requirements for transmitting information laid {{the foundations for}} later advances by Claude Shannon, {{which led to the}} development of information theory. In particular, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a telegraph channel per unit time is limited to twice the bandwidth of the channel, and published his results in the papers Certain factors affecting <b>telegraph</b> <b>speed</b> (1924) and Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory (1928).

50|$|Smith {{contracted}} with Cornell and Speed in 1847 {{to build a}} line from Buffalo to Detroit, Chicago and Milwaukee, and Speed moved to Detroit. Speed built the section from Detroit west. He made a sub-contract with Jeptha Wade {{for the construction of}} a line from Detroit to Jackson, the first line completed west of Buffalo in the summer of 1847. When the line reached Chicago it was organized at the Erie and Michigan <b>Telegraph</b> Company with <b>Speed</b> as President. Direct contact was established between Chicago and Buffalo in January, 1849. However, the line was not well constructed and revenues were initially small.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the telegraph led to a compression of time and space. Tom Standage believes that prior to the <b>telegraph</b> the <b>speed</b> at which information reached its audience was completely dependent on the transport used to disperse that information. The {{development of}} the telegraph freed the transmission of information from the time constraints of transport and eliminated geographic borders. (Standage:1998, p. 102) With the immediate flow of communication came speculation concerning the possible effects of instantaneous communication on society. These speculations included {{the idea that the}} telegraph would “cut out the middle man” and lead to the downfall and eventual extinction of the printed press. (Standage:1998, p. 149) This is because newspapers at this time could only disperse information as quickly as the transport that carried them. However, this speculation was proven incorrect with newspaper and telegraph companies establishing an alliance that allowed reporters to use the telegraph to instantly transport breaking stories back to the office. (Standage:1998, p. 150) This gave newspapers the advantage of a far greater reach of information and readership. (Standage:1998, p. 150) ...|$|R

In 1942, Palmer established the first automatic teletypesetter circuits to join together a group of newspapers. In the midst of World War II, there was a shortage of workers available for the newspaper business.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{model of}} the transmission line was probably described by Georg Ohm (1827) who established that resistance in a wire is proportional to its length. The Ohm model thus included only resistance. Latimer Clark noted that signals were delayed and elongated along a cable, an undesirable form of distortion now called dispersion but then called retardation, and Michael Faraday (1853) established that {{this was due to}} the capacitance present in the transmission line. Lord Kelvin (1854) found the correct mathematical description needed in his work on early transatlantic cables; he arrived at an equation identical to the conduction of a heat pulse along a metal bar. This model incorporates only resistance and capacitance, but that is all that was needed in undersea cables dominated by capacitance effects. Kelvin's model predicts a limit on the <b>telegraph</b> signalling <b>speed</b> of a cable but Kelvin still did not use the concept of bandwidth, the limit was entirely explained in terms of the dispersion of the telegraph symbols. The mathematical {{model of the}} transmission line reached its fullest development with Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside (1881) introduced series inductance and shunt conductance into the model making four distributed elements in all. This model is now known as the telegrapher's equation and the distributed elements are called the primary line constants.|$|R

The tide would rise for an hour yet and there was already two feet more water than his vessel drew in the channel he must enter. Then the lookout reported a buoy ahead, and he rang his <b>telegraph</b> for more <b>speed.</b> He was in the channel now and another buoy farther on would warn him of the only dangerous bend.
