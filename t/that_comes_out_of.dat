25|$|In the {{cardinal}} directions of Midwestern Native Americans, the wolf represented the west, but it represented the southeast for the Pawnee tribe. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf {{was the first}} creature to experience death. The Wolf Star, enraged at not having been invited to attend a council on how the Earth should be made, sent a wolf to steal the whirlwind bag of The Storm <b>that</b> <b>Comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the West, which contained the first humans. Upon being freed from the bag, the humans killed the wolf, thus bringing death into the world. Native Americans have long seen the wolf as an animal of power. Many tribes credit the actual creator of the earth to be a wolf. The Arikara and Ojibwe believed a wolfman spirit made the Great Plains for them and for other animals. Many tribes consider wolves to be closely related to humans. The reason for this belief {{is because of the}} wolf’s dedication to its pack, a trait the tribes attributed with themselves. The Navajo tribe was known for performing healing ceremonies where they would call upon wolves to restore health to their ill. Wolves were admired for their superb hunting skills.Prayers were offered in honor of wolves before they went out of hunting excursions. The Pawnee’s connection with wolves was so great that their hand signal for Pawnee was actually the same one that they had for wolf. Before battles, Apache warriors would pray, sing, and dance to gain the teamwork, strength, and bravery of wolves.|$|E

500|$|AOL TV's Jason Hughes {{was more}} negative, criticizing the episode {{for taking a}} [...] "soft approach" [...] to the {{television}} industry when it [...] "had a chance for some sharp satire". He elaborated that the writers [...] "had {{a little bit of}} fun talking about networks meddling in shows – as well as agents trying to control content as when Joan Rivers booted Janeane Garofalo for being funnier than Krusty – and the differences between cable original programming and broadcast programming. But they had the potential they had to make some bold statements about television and how the industry works throughout, and simply didn't." [...] Hughes did, however, like the King of the Hill appearance, which he described as a [...] "fun nod". Further criticism came from the conservative Parents Television Council (PTC), which named The Simpsons the [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] because [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] contains [...] "content inappropriate for the Family Hour". The group wrote that the [...] "frank sexual dialogue warranted a TV-14 rating, but the episode was rated TV-PG. Fox network executives surely know that almost nothing <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Joan Rivers’ mouth is rated PG; but they chose to rate the program inappropriately anyway, thus blindsiding parents and children with crude content." [...] PTC cited examples such as Annie saying that every night in his early days, Krusty [...] "had [...] rolling in the aisles, followed by a roll in the hay with me," [...] and that [...] "Today's kids are less sensitive than an Army condom.

500|$|The {{political}} climate in the United States and in Arizona {{in particular was}} pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act.

The anger, the hatred, the bigotry {{that goes on in}} this country is getting to be outrageous." [...] He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become [...] "the capital" [...] of such feelings. [...] "We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry," [...] he said. But, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard. International media referred to the {{political climate}} in the United States and the Palin map in particular. The French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm [...] "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence." [...] President Obama called the shooting an [...] "unspeakable tragedy", adding that [...] "such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society". Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack [...] "senseless and cruel violence" [...] and House Speaker John Boehner said, [...] "An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society". Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement noting, [...] "we in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own", with the death of Chief Judge John Roll.|$|E

This is an [...] "overdraft" [...] of about [...] of water over what their underground aquifer can [...] "normally" [...] refill. To replace this [...] "overdraft" [...] of water into the aquifer, they have flotation ponds that catch rain runoff water, and supplement with other water they either buy or recycle, then let the water soak into the ground (spreading water) to help replenish {{the water in the}} aquifer(s). In addition they buy Colorado River water that is shipped via the Colorado River Aqueduct, and they accept part of the treated municipal wastewater of the about 4,000,000 people in their district and treat it to additional purity and sanitation levels by using reverse osmosis and advanced filtering. Their largest tertiary water treatment facility is the Leo J. Vander Lans Advanced Water Treatment facility. The water out of this facility is better than the water <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "average" [...] municipal water treatment facility. To finance their water recycling projects WRD charges $268 per acre-foot of water pumped out, which generates about $65,000,000/year. WRD is now on a project (WIN) to enlarge their water treatment facilities to take larger quantities of treated municipal wastewater and treat enough of it that they will not have to buy Colorado River water. Overall it is estimated that this project provides over 40% of the water used in the Southern California district served by the WRD.|$|E
