5|$|Upon {{development}} of Debby on June23, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued {{from the mouth of}} the Pearl River to Morgan City, Louisiana, excluding New Orleans or Lake Pontchartrain. On the following day, a separate tropical storm warning was put into effect from the Mississippi and Alabama border <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Ochlockonee River in Florida. At 1500UTC on June24, the tropical storm warning was extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Suwannee River. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to Anclote Key. These were all canceled at 1500UTC on June25, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from Destin to Englewood, Florida. Early on June26, a tropical storm warning was issued from Mexico Beach to Englewood, Florida. By 2100UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Steinhatchee River in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|About 21hours before Helene made landfall, the NHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from the border of Louisiana and Mississippi <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Aucilla River along the Florida Panhandle.

5|$|At 2100UTC on July 8 a {{hurricane}} watch {{was put into}} effect for coastal areas from the Steinhatchee River, Florida <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Pearl River.

5|$|Copano Bay is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on parts of the west, south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the Live Oak peninsula. The peninsula {{is located on the}} eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is spanned by the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the bay. Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Port Bay.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Pascagoula, Mississippi <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Mississippi River as Bertha became {{a tropical storm}}. The warning occurred 90minutes before the storm made landfall. All warnings were discontinued when Bertha weakened to a tropical depression over Louisiana. No watches or warnings were required for Texas, due to the improbability of it re-intensifying.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hours after}} developing, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm watch from Titusville, Florida, to Brunswick, Georgia, due to uncertainty in the track of the storm. Hours after becoming {{a tropical storm}}, a tropical storm warning was issued from Fernandina Beach, Florida, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Savannah River, with a tropical storm watch further northward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the South Santee River in South Carolina, though these were cancelled after Edouard turned to the east. About 10hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued another tropical storm warning from Titusville, Florida to Brunswick, Georgia, with a tropical storm watch further south to Sebastian Inlet, Florida.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Little River, South Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds {{and the lower}} Chesapeake Bay. The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South Carolina <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Santee River, {{as well as from}} Chincoteague, Virginia northward to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the East Coast of the United States. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Fire Island, New York and from Cape Fear, North Carolina <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear. Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km).|$|E

Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E
