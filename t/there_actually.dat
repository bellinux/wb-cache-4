5|$|On 24 June, Monmouth's army encamped at Pensford, {{and a small}} force skirmished {{with the}} Gloucester Militia {{to take control of}} Keynsham, a vital {{crossing}} point over the River Avon. Monmouth intended to attack the city of Bristol (the largest and most important city after London at that time). However, he heard the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort. There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham. These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity then <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> was. Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point, when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia, he would probably have been able to take the city and the final outcome of the rebellion might have been very different. Once Bristol had been taken, more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible.|$|E

There may be a small increased risk for minor birth defects such as an inguinal hernia, but the number of reports is too small to be sure if <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> is any risk.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>actually</b> was an NYPD officer, John Alexander Kennedy, {{who claimed}} to have been the one who {{uncovered}} the Baltimore Plot; but, unlike Powell's movie character, he was not actually on scene. Moreover, in real life, Kennedy was the superintendent of the entire force. In the film, he is depicted as a mere detective sergeant.|$|E

This term is sometimes abbreviated as BLT (<b>there's</b> <b>actually</b> a BLT instruction on the PDP-10) and pronounced 'blit'. The term 'blittable' expresses whether it is legal to copy an object using a block transfer.|$|R
25|$|Opinion {{surveys of}} what {{respondents}} {{thought was the}} right level of inequality have found Americans no more accepting of income inequality than other citizens of other nations, but more accepting of what they thought the level of inequality was in their country, being {{under the impression that}} there was less inequality than <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> was.|$|E
25|$|As it was then, this {{election}} is still today shrouded in controversy, and there exist two popular stances in this discussion. On one hand, some people argue {{that there was a}} resolve in favor of independence, as <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> was a factual majority for secession, even if it was a small one. On the other hand, other people argue that the majority was far too small, as there were in fact only 161 more votes for independence, and this side specifically argues that only a qualified majority can be large enough grounds to pass a vote of such social and political consequence.|$|E
25|$|To deceive the Americans {{into believing}} {{there were more}} British troops than <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> were, Brock's force carried out several bluffs. At the {{suggestion}} of Major Thomas Evans, the Brigade Major at Fort George, Brock gave his militia the cast-off uniforms of the 41st Regiment to make Hull believe most of the British force were regulars. The troops were told to light individual fires instead of one fire per unit, thereby creating {{the illusion of a}} much larger army. They marched to take up positions in plain sight of the Americans then quickly ducked behind entrenchments, and marched back out of sight to repeat the manoeuvre. The same trick was carried out during meals, where the line would dump their beans into a hidden pot, then return out of view to rejoin the end of the queue.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the Carathéodory way recounted {{just above}} {{does not use}} {{calorimetry}} or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat. The Carathéodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat. As recounted in more detail just above, the Carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity. It is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system, and from the actual work done by the system during the process. That internal energy difference {{is supposed to have}} been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work, processes that take the system between the initial and final states. By the Carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> physically exist enough such adiabatic processes, so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat. This presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the Carathéodory way. In fact, the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition, and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist.|$|E
500|$|Although {{nominally}} {{a member}} of the Victorian Left faction of the Labor Party, her election to Prime Minister occurred because of support from the Right factions of the party, with the hard Left planning to support Rudd in the Caucus vote had <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> been one. Analyses of Jacqueline Kent's 2009 biography of Gillard suggest that her membership in the Left faction is [...] "more organisational than ideological". In July 2010, historian Ross Fitzgerald said, [...] "...at least since [...] Gillard has sought to reposition herself more towards the Labor Right." ...|$|E
500|$|In post-structural {{literary}} theory Cayce is {{compared with the}} main character, Oedipa Maas, of Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 as detectives interpreting clues but with neither the character nor the reader knowing if <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> is a pattern to be found and, if there is one, whether it is real or [...] conspiracy. Gibson's use of name-dropping brands {{to create a sense}} of [...] "in-group style … of those in the know" [...] is traced back to Thomas Pynchon's 1963 novel V.. Gibson's writing style is said to be similar to Raymond Chandler's detective stories and Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers that used MacGuffins (the identity of the maker of the footage, in this case) to drive the story. Gibson's social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell.|$|E

500|$|The Graeco-Roman anatomist Galen (AD 129–210) named seven {{pairs of}} cranial nerves. Much later, in 1664, English anatomist Sir Thomas Willis {{suggested}} that there were actually 9 pairs of nerves. [...] Finally, in 1778, German anatomist Samuel Soemmering named the 12 pairs of nerves that are generally accepted today. However, {{because many of the}} nerves emerge from the brain stem as rootlets, there is continual debate as to how many nerves <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> are, and how they should be grouped. There is reason to consider both the olfactory (I) and Optic (II) nerves to be brain tracts, rather than cranial nerves. Further, the very small terminal nerve (nerve N or O) exists in humans but may not be functional. In other animals, it appears to be important to sexual receptivity based on perceptions of phermones ...|$|E
500|$|Father Louis Hennepin with companions Michel Aco and Antoine Auguelle (aka Picard Du Gay) {{headed north}} {{from the area}} of Illinois after coming into that area with an {{exploration}} party headed by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. They were captured by a Dakota tribe in 1680. [...] While with the tribe, they came across and named the Falls of Saint Anthony. Soon, Du Lhut negotiated to have Hennepin's party released from captivity. [...] Hennepin returned to Europe and wrote a book, Description of Louisiana, published in 1683, about his travels where many portions (including the part about Saint Anthony Falls) were strongly embellished. [...] As an example, he described the falls as being a drop of fifty or sixty feet, when they were really only about sixteen feet. [...] Pierre-Charles Le Sueur explored the Minnesota River to the Blue Earth area around 1700. [...] He thought the blue earth {{was a source of}} copper, and he told stories about the possibility of mineral wealth, but <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> was no copper to be found.|$|E
500|$|According to {{a theory}} put forward in Journal of Australian Studies (JAS) by an {{independent}} researcher, in 1789, British marines used smallpox against indigenous tribes in New South Wales. [...] This occasion was also discussed earlier in Bulletin of the History of Medicine and by David Day in his book Claiming a Continent: A New History of Australia. [...] Prior to the JAS article this theory was disputed by some academics. Jack Carmody claimed {{the cause of the}} outbreak in question was more likely due to chickenpox, which at the time was sometimes identified as a mild form of smallpox. [...] While it was noted that, in the 8-month voyage of the First Fleet and the following 14 months there were no reports of smallpox amongst the colonists and that as smallpox has an incubation period of 10–12 days it is unlikely it was present in the first fleet, it is now known that the likely source was bottles of smallpox virus possessed by [...] First Fleet surgeons and <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> was a report of smallpox amongst the colonists – a seaman, Jefferies.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the journey, the duo {{encounter}} numerous mishaps: first, SpongeBob tries {{a pioneer}} trick {{he claims to}} have seen in a movie where he listens to the ground and hears a truck coming. But when he tries to get the driver's attention by doing a bizarre dance {{in the middle of the}} road, the driver speeds up and nearly runs over SpongeBob. Then, the duo are caught up in a storm that eventually turns into a tornado, and Squidward tells SpongeBob to let the pizza go as it causes them to get sucked into the tornado. However, the pizza saves their lives after SpongeBob turns it into a parachute. Upon landing, Squidward panics when he realizes the road they were following is nowhere in sight. SpongeBob then notices some moss on a rock and claims that they should go in the direction the moss is pointing (another one of SpongeBob's [...] "pioneer tricks"), but Squidward refuses and goes in the other direction, despite <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> being civilization where the moss was pointing.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> was a [...] "Contest" [...] in which David and some friends of his took part, {{although}} he did not initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did not talk about it with Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script that was originally meant to be used in [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles", the original pilot episode.|$|E
500|$|Gray wolves howl to {{assemble}} the pack (usually before and after hunts), to pass on an alarm (particularly at a den site), to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances. Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to [...] Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs. Male wolves give voice through an octave, passing to a deep bass with a stress on [...] "O", while females produce a modulated nasal baritone with stress on [...] "U". Pups almost never howl, while yearling wolves produce howls ending {{in a series of}} dog-like yelps. Howling consists of a fundamental frequency that may lie between 150 and 780Hz, and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones. The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly, and may change direction as many as four or five times. Howls used for calling pack mates to a kill are long, smooth sounds similar {{to the beginning of the}} cry of a horned owl. When pursuing prey, they emit a higher pitched howl, vibrating on two notes. When closing in on their prey, they emit a combination of a short bark and a howl. When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than <b>there</b> <b>actually</b> are. Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present. Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable. The two are however mutually intelligible, as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to European-style howls made by biologists.|$|E
