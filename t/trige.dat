50|$|A {{platform}} holds 3 transformers which increase voltage from 33 to 220 kV for transporting the {{alternating current}} power 25 km to land through a single 3-conductor cable (diameter 26 cm) and a further 56 km to <b>Trige</b> (near Aarhus) where a 400 kV main power hub can distribute the power. There are switchyard reactors along the cable to provide reactive power {{to compensate for}} line capacitance.|$|E
50|$|The barge was {{anchored}} at basin III {{close to}} the Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet silos. At 13:47 on 4 July 1944 it detonated with 150 tonnes of ammunition, sending a kilometer-high column of water into the air which lingered for several minutes. The explosion could be heard 20 kilometers away in Femmøller on Djursland, in <b>Trige</b> the earth could be felt shaking, in Risskov plaster fell off houses, and in Riis Skov people ran for cover from the beaches.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{articles}} of furniture in the church, the pulpit from c. 1610 deserves special mention. It is ascribed to the woodcarver Mikkel van Grønningen in Hornslet, who supplied works both for Aarhus Cathedral and several East Jutland churches, including <b>Trige.</b> The altarpiece and altar candlesticks were also obtained {{in the first half}} of the 17th century, while the Romanesque baptismal font was retained as usually happened. The greater part of the furniture, which showed the church's former close relationship with the Constantinsborg and Marselisborg estates, has now disappeared, and only a chasuble cross from about 1700 has been preserved. The clockwork in the tower is from the beginning of the 19th century. In the cemetery tombstones from the 17th century indicate the graves of clergy belonging to the same family.|$|E
50|$|The {{furniture}} was restored {{and added to}} when a considerable rebuilding programme took place in 1924—25. In particular the altarpiece which was decorated by Per Glarmester (Lit. Per Glazier) in 1595. A former altarpiece painting was produced by the animal painter Christian David Gebauer. The chalice was donated 1551 by Bishop Ove Bille (1520—36), as indicated by a tablet inscribed in Latin. A cross embroidered in gold and silver is preserved {{from the back of}} a chasuble, now disappeared, dating back to c. 1725. The pewter dish of the granite Romanesque baptismal font was made 1686 by Hans Nielsen Gotlænder, who worked in Århus, and donated to the church by the patron, Constantin von Marselis, and his wife Sofia Elisabeth Carisius. The pulpit from c. 1650 is from the same workshop as the pulpits in Åby and <b>Trige.</b> The bell was cast 1744 by Lorenz Strahlborn of Lübeck.|$|E

40|$|This {{recording}} dissertation surveys post- 1945 literature {{written for}} piano trio (violin, violoncello and piano) by ten Danish composers. The literature was first considered for inclusion by searching a database {{provided by the}} Danish Music Information Center (www. mic. dk). Scores were rented from the publisher Edition Wilhelm Hansen AS, or purchased from the publisher Samfundet til Udgivelse af Dansk Musik. An additional score published by Viking Musikforlag was used as well. The music was then studied and evaluated for selection. During the selection process, the following criteria were considered: 1) quality of the compositions; 2) recognition of the composers at the national or international level; 3) whether the compositions had been previously recorded; and 4) variety of compositional styles. The selected works are written by Niels Viggo Bentzon, Vagn Holmboe, Anders Koppel, Herman D. Koppel, Bent Lorentzen, Anders Nordentoft, Per Norgard, Michael Nyvang, Karl Aage Rasmussen, and Poul Rovsing Olsen. The selected compositions were practiced, rehearsed, and performed under direct supervision of the composers and other expert musicians. In order {{to better understand the}} compositional style of each composer, relevant books, articles, and recordings were researched and studied. This recording dissertation is supported by a written document. A subjective preference for program balance was exercised to determine the order of recorded works. The written document is divided into chapters defined by composer, following the order of the recorded document, which include the composers' biographies and notes referring to the recorded compositions. The recording took place at the Manzius Gaarden, Birkerod, Denmark during three sessions: July 31 -August 2, 2002, March 2 and 3, 2003, and June 2 - 4, 2003. The music for this dissertation was recorded by the members of the Jalina Trio; Line Fredens, violin, Janne Fredens, cello and Natsuki Fukasawa, piano. Aksel <b>Trige,</b> a well-respected recording engineer, was engaged for the recording and editing. Additionally, a Hamburg Steinway concert grand piano was rented and a Joseph Guarnerius filius Andreas Cremona violin (1706) was provided by the Augustinus Fonden, Denmark. The cellist used her own instrument, Vuillaume of Paris (c. 1850). The expense of this recording was partially paid by generous grants from the Augustinus Fonden, the Solist Foreningen af 1921, and the Dansk Musikerforbunds Kollective Rettighedsmidler. The compositions selected for this recording dissertation are assumed to be previously unrecorded, with the exception of Poul Rovsing Olsen's Trio II...|$|E
