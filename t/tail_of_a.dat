Only one species, however, has any effect on gameplay: eating the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain kind of lizard {{increases}} Wander's stamina gauge. Likewise, the player may find fruit that increases Wander's maximum health.|$|E
5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or {{falling in love with}} humans.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is then {{ordered to}} Mars {{to destroy the}} array, but is turned away when a warning shot from the weapon damages the ship. Gannet Brooks, now in the brig, reveals to Ensign Mayweather she is a Starfleet Intelligence operative, and that Terra Prime {{probably}} has an operative aboard. Under the urging of Minister Samuels, the crew of Enterprise conceive a way to approach the deadly station undetected, using a shuttlepod hidden inside the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comet. Captain Archer elects to lead the away mission, along with Lieutenant Reed, Doctor Phlox, and Mayweather.|$|E
50|$|In a G/G/2 queue with {{heavy-tailed}} job sizes, the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> {{the delay}} time distribution {{is known to}} behave like the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exponential distribution squared under low loads and like the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exponential distribution for high loads.|$|R
50|$|In {{probability}} theory, a sub-Gaussian {{distribution is}} a probability distribution with strong tail decay property. Informally, the <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sub-Gaussian distribution {{are dominated by}} (i.e. decay at least as fast as) the <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Gaussian.|$|R

5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E
5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> British bulldog {{is an example of}} a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the {{coccygeal}} vertebrae but in other areas of the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|What Bouton {{described}} {{is likely}} to remain a mystery, but various theories have been proposed. In 1906, Tommaso Salvadori noted that the Martinique macaw seemed similar to the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) of mainland South America, and may have been the same bird. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. Edwards' Dodo, a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw, which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue, but the origin of this macaw is unknown. Another macaw in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis). Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow macaw, as does a mid-1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique macaw specimen, which {{was supposed to have been}} collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a hoax, combining a burrowing parakeet (Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni) with the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dove.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. These images are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found {{on the wall of}} the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches around the base of the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E

25|$|Mating: Mammals often {{initiate}} mating by grooming, stroking or rubbing {{against each}} other. This {{provides the opportunity}} to apply chemical signals and to assess those excreted by the potential mate. Touch may also announce {{the intention of the}} male to mount the female, as when a male kangaroo grabs the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female. During mating, touch stimuli are important for pair positioning, coordination and genital stimulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{figure of}} Centaurus {{can be traced}} back to a Babylonian {{constellation}} known as the Bison-man (MUL.GUD.ALIM).

It has been closely associated with the Sun god Utu-Shamash from very early times.|$|E
