500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> want to see fight. Then you work {{your way to the}} time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 free agent cycle, Lawton had eight teams that he would sign with. Two teams were intermediately not interested. The Seattle Mariners, which were one of the teams Lawton wanted to join, were wary of taking Lawton because of his drug suspension, but {{eventually}} signed him. The deal was made official on December 23, 2005. His contract was a one-year major league contract worth US$400,000, with more than US$1 million in possible incentives. It also had a no-trade clause. During spring training in 2006, the Mariners allowed Lawton and teammate Eddie Guardado leave camp to attend the funeral services for their former teammate Kirby Puckett. Lawton returned from his suspension on April 12. After activating him on the roster, the Mariners designated catcher Guillermo Quiróz for assignment. Lawton gave Mariners officials the permission required to release him, saying that [...] "I went to them in a friendly manner and just said 'Hey, I'll be <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> can send out' if they felt the need". Lawton was designated for assignment on May 20. Mariners general manager Bill Bavasi added Mike Morse to the major league roster in Lawton's place. With the Mariners that season, Lawton batted [...]259 with five runs scored, seven hits, and one RBI in 11 games played.|$|E

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2007 season, it was rumored that there was a rift between Washington and Rangers star Mark Teixeira. Asked about it, Washington responded, A lot of times we make three outs on four or five pitches... I just can't see that late in the game when you're four or five runs down. You're {{at the point where the}} starter is out of the game, you're in the middle (of the bullpen), these are <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>you</b> want to get to. I've never asked him (Teixeira) to do it when the closer is in the game. But <b>the</b> middle <b>guys,</b> <b>you</b> want to make 'em throw... He feels like he's going to only get one pitch in that type of situation to do something with. He wants to take advantage of it. I've got no problem with that. But can you guarantee with that one pitch that you're going to do something with it? I don't think any ballplayer on earth can guarantee that. You might pop it up, miss it, roll over it, jam yourself. Then you make one out on one pitch. I want to see him get a pitchers' strike right there.|$|R
