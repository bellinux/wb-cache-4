5|$|The bulk of {{the police}} forces moved out to Fort Macleod in 1876, <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> down on the whisky trade. A year later, Lieutenant Governor David Laird moved the seat of {{government}} to Battleford. The decision was based upon the original plans of constructing the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) through Battleford.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s, the Metropolitan Police {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> down {{on illegal}} gambling held in social clubs along Whitechapel Road. The Brancroft Social Club was based at No.69, and in March 1944, a police raid uncovered unlicensed horse and dog race betting {{which led to}} the arrest of the club's owner and 21 patrons.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, however, he allowed his pro-American {{minister}} of defense, General Lon Nol, <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> down on leftist activities, crushing the Pracheachon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi. Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost {{the support of}} Cambodia's conservatives {{as a result of}} his failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} week of release (June 1–6, 2010), it sold 2,095,878 DVD units (equivalent to $35,441,297) and topped the DVD sales chart for two {{continuous}} weeks. By May 22, 2011, it had sold 4,313,680 units ($76,413,043). It failed <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> the 2010 top ten DVDs list in terms of units sold, but reached 10th place on that chart in terms of sales revenue.|$|E

50|$|The {{stocks of}} early models were {{susceptible}} <b>to</b> <b>cracking,</b> sometimes attributed <b>to</b> {{the shape of}} the receiver; later models, such as the dovetail scope variant, appeared to solve this problem. The pump grip of all models is susceptible <b>to</b> <b>cracking,</b> the wood between the magazine and barrel being especially thin, this rarely detected unless the rifle is disassembled.|$|R

5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Some recent notable {{projects}} {{have included the}} Deployable Joint Command and Control System and ULTRA AP, a concept combat vehicle. In 2010, researchers developed microfabricated planar ion traps using VLSI techniques {{for use in a}} trapped ion quantum computer. Also in 2010, researchers developed a method of using GPGPU <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> passwords, coming up with a minimum secure password length of 12 characters. Researchers are investigating the use of radar as a possible concussion detection tool.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{was also}} {{susceptible}} to intense heat, which would cause it <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> and collapse. Byzantine sources recorded {{the demolition of}} stone structures caused by placing clay pots of burning charcoal {{at the base of}} walls moistened with vinegar or urine, and the 6th century treatise by an engineer in Justinian's army includes the lighting fires beneath the walls amongst its instructions for sieges.|$|E

5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began <b>to</b> <b>crack,</b> then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E
5|$|The vice {{activities}} {{on the island and}} in the county were not unique in Texas. San Antonio had perhaps the second most infamous red-light district in the early 20th century and most major cities in the state had significant vice activities at least until mid-century, though most went into decline before Galveston's did. During the Open Era Galveston's vice industries dominated, while most other areas of the state were at times forced <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> down on vice due to public pressure.|$|E

5|$|Winehouse's {{parents and}} in-laws {{publicly}} reported their numerous concerns, the latter citing {{fears that the}} two might commit suicide. Fielder-Civil's father encouraged fans to boycott Winehouse's music, and Mitch Winehouse said this would not help. Fielder-Civil was quoted in a British tabloid as saying he introduced Winehouse <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> cocaine and heroin. During a visit with Mitch Winehouse at the prison in July 2008, Fielder-Civil reportedly {{said that he and}} Winehouse would cut themselves to ease the pain of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004 season began, the Houston Astros signed Andy Pettitte {{to boost}} their {{starting}} rotation. As a result, Robertson found himself battling with Tim Redding, Jared Fernandez, Carlos Hernández and Brandon Duckworth for the final spot in the rotation. After Roger Clemens was signed as well, the Astros decided before spring training began that Robertson would pitch out of the bullpen for the season. By the end of spring training, Robertson failed <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> the bullpen, and was to be demoted to the Zephyrs. On March 31, just before the season started, the Astros traded Robertson to the Cleveland Indians for Luke Scott and Willy Taveras.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle {{was in a}} poor {{state of}} repair, and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge {{and parts of the}} walls had {{collapsed}} in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable <b>to</b> <b>crack.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the diraction of plane incident waves from innity by a conguration of arbitrarily-shaped narrow cracks in a thin elastic plate which covers the entire surface of a uid of constant depth. This problem has application <b>to</b> <b>cracks</b> in ice sheets and also <b>to</b> <b>cracks</b> that may occur in very large oating platforms, such as those being considered for use as an oshore runway in Japan...|$|R
30|$|For {{stainless}} steels and nickel-based superalloys, {{because of their}} low thermal conductivity and high thermal expansion coefficient, they are more vulnerable <b>to</b> generating <b>cracks</b> with high susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>cracking</b> in an SLM process [9, 27, 42, 43]. To solve this problem, pre-heating the substrate and improving the ambient temperature are recommended <b>to</b> reduce the <b>cracks</b> in the SLM fabricated parts [26, 27].|$|R

5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens <b>to</b> <b>crack.</b>|$|E
5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} is limited, with {{numerous}} restrictions on publishing rights and information dissemination. The government has previously tried <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> down on opposition papers before elections. In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Texas City Safe Street Task Force, the Galveston County Sheriff's Office, {{and other}} {{agencies}} started {{an investigation into the}} gang. That year, 10 people were arrested, accused of drug charges. In 2011 the Federal Government of the United States arrested four men from Bacliff, accusing {{to be a part of}} the gang and charging them crimes related <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> cocaine distribution. In 2011 12 people accused of being members faced drug charges. In 2012 a federal judge in Houston sentenced four 4SB men to prison. They had pleaded guilty to their crimes.|$|E
