40|$|These notes {{provide an}} {{introduction}} to Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle. Optimal con-trol, {{and in particular the}} Maximum Principle, is one of the real triumphs of mathematical control theory. Certain of the developments stemming from the Maximum Principle are now a part of the standard tool box of users of control theory. While the Maximum Principle has proved to be extremely valuable in applications, here our emphasis is on understanding the Maximum Principle, where it comes from, and what light it sheds on the subject of control theory in general. For this reason, readers looking for many instances of applications of the Maximum Principle will not find what we say here too rewarding. Such applications can be found in many other places in the literature. What is more difficult to obtain, however, is an appreciation for the Maximum Principle. It is true that the original presentation of Pontryagin, Boltyanskii, Gamkrelidze, and Mishchenko [1986] is still an excellent one in many respects. However, it is probably the case that one can benefit by focusing exclusively on understanding the ideas behind the Maximum Principle, {{and this is what we}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here.</b> Let us outline the structure of our presentation...|$|R
40|$|In its {{narrative}} {{style as}} well as in its cultural environment, magical realism provides the optimal literary field to respond to the cultural issues and conditions that traverse contemporary postcolonial society. For example, the codification in the magical-realist narrative of both colonial and postcolonial discourses, involved in a dialectical struggle, reflects many of the problematic relations existing between colonizer and colonized in postcolonial culture. This leads to the investigation of hybridity as an important trope in the ongoing process of literary and cultural decolonization. This article explores the function of hybridity in three novels by Ben Okri, showing how, through the destabilization of such spaces as the real and the imaginary, the new and the old, and the self and the other, a third space emerges where irreconcilable perspectives and contradictory properties coexist, although problematically. In this sense, the fictional space, time and characters displace polar oppositions and make it difficult to conceive of any version of reality as having a greater claim to absolute truth or unique referentiality. Consequently, and in theoretical and political terms, what magical realism <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is replacing the dominant culture and its version of truth by a new mode of perception that opens up various levels of thought and accepts the possibility of many truths to be considered simultaneously and not hierarchically...|$|R
40|$|General {{methods for}} the {{construction}} of magic squares of any order have been searched for centuries. Several ‘standard strategies’ have been found for this purpose, such as the ‘knight movement’, or the construction of bordered magic squares, which played an impor-tant {{role in the development of}} general methods. What we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is <b>to</b> give a general and comprehensive approach to the construction of magic borders, capable of assuming methods produced in the past as particular cases. This general ap-proach consists of a transformation of the problem of constructing magic borders to a simpler- almost trivial- form. In the first section, we give some definitions and notation. The second section consists of the exposition and proof of our method for the different cases that appear (Theorems 1 and 2). As an application of this method, in the third section we caracterize magic borders of even order, giving therefore a first general result for bordered magic squares. Although methods {{for the construction}} of bordered magic squares have always been presented as individual succesful attempts to solve the problem, we will see that a common pattern underlies the fun-damental mechanisms that lead to the construction of such squares. This approach provides techniques for constructing many magic bor-dered squares of any order, which is a first step to construct all of them,and finally know how many bordered squares are for any or-der. These may be the first elements of a general theory on bordered magic squares...|$|R

40|$|Dichotomies {{are a way}} we simplify {{interconnected}} hierarchical {{complexities of}} race, class, ethnicity, gender and power plays in our society. The division {{between male and female}} has been the primary dichotomy I have focused on in this discussion. My argument is that dichotomies create a cyclical loop which reinforces social injustice between genders in societies cross culturally and across time. This cycle of gender division includes cultural, built and activity patterns. There is no single point of origin of these patterns, but rather a constant loop of reinforcement from one pattern to the other. What I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is not judge or criticize these societies and their values; rather I am evaluating them comparatively with other societies based on the status of women. I have found these cultural, built and activity patterns by documenting examples that exist cross culturally and across time. In order to do this I had to set up some criteria for selecting my case studies. I have divided the examples into four categories: 1. Egalitarian subsistence societies having equal status for women with respect to men and other women in similar cultures. 2. Hierarchical societies having lower status of women with respect to men and other women in a similar culture. 3. 19 th and 20 th century case studies in urban societies having lower status of women with respect to men. 4. 19 th and 20 th century case studies in reforms and utopian proposals that aimed at making egalitarian societies with equal status among men and women. I found that the public/private cultural pattern was the most recurring pattern. It is present in egalitarian, hierarchical and 19 th and 20 th century Victorian society. This pattern exists cross-culturally and across time. In the egalitarian subsistence societies, dichotomies are not understood as a set of oppositions such as superior and inferior. Their belief in harmony and balance in nature emphasized equality, unlike the hierarchical societies. In hierarchical subsistence societies, dichotomies divided people by assigning them public or private roles. In 19 th and 20 th century Victorian society an ideal gentleman was supposed to have serious, dignified, chivalrous qualities and an ideal lady was supposed to be moral, beautiful, cheerful and elegant. This shows that the cultural patterns were enforced upon individuals and they had to act accordingly in the society. I also looked at the utopian solutions of making childcare, laundry, and food preparation community activities. These radical solutions were focused on improving the cultural, built and activity patterns simultaneously. I have evaluated these case studies comparatively based on the status of women. While it’s difficult to state a solution to accommodate the layers of gender segregation that exist within cultural, built and activity patterns, I don’t think proposing an overtly radical solution is the right direction either. I would strongly recommend more awareness of feminist education in architecture and engineering schools. There should be more incentives and scholarships for women in traditionally male dominated professions like architecture and engineering. Learning about these patterns of gender segregation in different societies is also a way to begin this cultural progress.

40|$|Early school-leavers get {{practical}} training CUE: Children who {{are forced to}} leave school early because of poverty, may find they have few opportunities to learn a trade and build a strong future. But for some such children in The Gambia, a government scheme is offering a way forward out of poverty. The National Youth Service Scheme draws about 100 young people a year from across the country, the candidates being selected by interview at a regional level. The trainees are fully funded throughout their period of training, {{and are able to}} choose which type of work they wish to learn. Agriculture is a popular choice, as Ismaila Senghore discovered when he spoke to the Head of Administration of the scheme, Mr. Sheriff Gomez. IN:		?We have a large farm ? OUT:		? people back to the land. DUR?N	 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Sheriff Gomez on how The Gambia?s National Youth Service Scheme is alleviating poverty by equipping young people with practical skills. Transcript Gomez	We have a large farm, 30 hectare farm at Niani Beteh, which the National Youth Service Scheme targets to attract people to engage in all the facets of agricultural training: animal husbandry is one of them, horticulture, cash crop production, poultry, orchard production, bee-keeping, whatever it takes. Because we believe these things will have a market, we believe these things will become sustainable wherever they are grown, because there is a large demand in the country for agricultural production. Senghore	Now what is the cycle of training, how many years? Gomez	The national youth service scheme is mandated to train young people for two years, and that starts with an orientation at the camp, where we bring all of them who are trained together, put them in a camp, train them together for six weeks orientation, where they can chose the fields that they want to train in by themselves, and then we find now the institutions, relevant institutions, and quality institutions that can train them. And we train them free; the institution bears this cost for the young persons, and we train them on that regard, and then distribute them out. So far since inception in 1996 we have recorded 600 core members so far. We are in the sixth batch which marks our 618 core members under training now. Senghore	What is the training format? How much is practice and how much is theory? Gomez	We in this scheme here have always advocated that we need, because of the short duration, a training package that will be practical oriented. That?s why we always endeavour for 85 % practical and then 15 % theory. We have recognised that within two years one person cannot be an expert. However we believe if you go through a co-ordinated, tailor-made programme, even if you are not an expert you will have received sufficient training {{to be able to put}} you out there, give you some help, and then you start on your own. So what we do is, for instance, we get to the Gambia college, they devise the training modules, based on their experience in the training department, in the training field, that they believe is appropriate for the individual, and then with this now they now inculcate this training into the young persons. Senghore	That sounds really good, because here I think the main thrust would be to stem the rural-urban drift, and since your people hail from the rural areas, a majority of them, I think it will go a long way in making sure that youth are established in the agricultural domain. Gomez	There is always a strong affinity between the young person and agriculture and the land. So what we are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> at the National Youth Service Scheme, is to train you in agriculture, show you that it is profitable, and then you can even do it in dignity. And then we try to get you, in our final phase, seed money, to give you those attractions that will now take you back to where you come from, establish you there, and then you start your cultivation. And I think it is quite correct to say that that attraction is there, and that is what the National Youth Service Scheme is trying to access now, to get people back to the land. End of tapeThe National Youth Service Scheme in The Gambia selects one hundred students per year, and offers training in a wide variety of practical skills.

40|$|This paper investigates {{into the}} {{background}} of the spectacular success of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930 - 2004), which seems to remain strong considering the fact that, as late as 2007, Derrida was still among the most quoted authors in the world, in humanities. The start of his career was the publication in 1967 of the extremely influential book On Grammatology devoted to the presentation of his chief idea known as deconstructionism. To put it shortly, this term alludes to the practice of reading and interpreting texts – whether literary or philosophical – against the intentions of their authors, so as to make them say what they were probably never meant to say. This method or doctrine soon became extremely popular, especially indepartments of comparative literature or literary criticism, both in the U. S. A., in France and the rest of Europe. Along with it came an attitude of radical scepticism which came in handy in cases of opposition. What I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is a close reading of De la grammatologie, in order to highlight flaws in Derrida's own text and argumentation. The conclusion reached is entirely in keeping with the spontaneous impression one gets from reading Derrida'stext. Apart from its tiring verbosity, his style is most of the time unbelievably obscure and even void of sense. Another recurrent problem is lack of referential exactness. But when, at times, the text becomes a bit less vague, it turns depreciatory and disdainful, as if to compensate for a lack of argumentative strength by hitting below the belt. Given these circumstances, the question is whether this text was originally meant to convey a serious theoretical discussion at all. An alternative interpretation discussed here consists in viewing it as a hoax played upon the reader to confuse him, the way the traditional "canular" was used in the famous École Normale Supérieure where Derrida was trained as a philosopher.

For nearly five years, he has been Dean Spong of the Marshall-Wythe School of Law at the College of William and Mary, in this ancient Colonial capital, where a dedication ceremony yesterday symbolized the achievement of one of his major goals: Completion of the new Matshall-Wythe building, at costs totaling nearly 6 million, for which the state provided about 5. 2 million and private sources provided about 500, 000 more. At the time of the cornerstone-laying, some 16 months ago, U. S. Chief Justice Warren Burger said that the new law school building, along with the adjacent National Center for State Court would make Williamsburg 2 ̆ 2 one of the major law centers in the country. 2 ̆ 2 Another speaker suggested also that the twice-reborn old law school, which is sometimes called the nation 2 ̆ 7 s first or oldest, would constitute 2 ̆ 2 one of the most modern and innovative facilities of its kind anywhere. 2 ̆ 2 At the time of the cornerstone-laying, too, Dean Spong made a little speech in which he said 2 ̆ 2 this is a day of joy, and it is a day of miracles, 2 ̆ 2 because 2 ̆ 2 this law school really isn 2 ̆ 7 t supposed to be here. 2 ̆ 2 (Established by the college board on Dec. 4, 1779, at the urgings of Gov. Thomas Jefferson, as a professorship 2 ̆ 2 of law and police, 2 ̆ 2 the teaching of law was broken off during the Civil War, not to be resumed until 1921, and then was almost abolished in 1939, only to be saved by an aroused body of students and alumni.) In a conversation sometime before yesterday 2 ̆ 7 s dedication, Spong was asked what, if the cornerstone day was a day of miracles, he would call the dedication day. 2 ̆ 2 It is still part of the same day of miracles [...] a sort of final culmination of that day, 2 ̆ 2 he said. 2 ̆ 2 Yes, I think it is a miracle that the school endured... It was so small for so long, and it overcame so many adversities. 2 ̆ 2 Well, would he say that the school has now arrived and achieved the 2 ̆ 2 major law center 2 ̆ 2 stature of which Chief Justice Burger spoke? 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t think we have arrived [...] but I think we now have the potential to become what Chief Justice Burger predicted... We may need another decade to achieve that potential, but I certainly believe we 2 ̆ 7 re on our way. 2 ̆ 2 There have been times [...] for instance, on the last, long night of the 1976 General Assembly session [...] when nobody, not even a hopeful new dean, could tell which way the law school was going. It took the 1976 Assembly all day Saturday night and until 9 o 2 ̆ 7 clock Sunday morning to settle a fiscal controversy that threatened to deprive William and Mary of construction funds for the law building. And it took more suspenseful work to put over the 1977 bond issue to which the project was then relegated, along with other major capital outlays for higher education. In the flashbacks of the Spong memory, there was also a day in September 1948, when Spong drove here from his home city of Portsmouth to report to Dean Dudley W. Woodbridge and begin to teach a course in international law and a course in government as a part-time member of the law faculty. Just back from a year of graduate work in international and comparative law, along with courses in forensic medicine at the University of Edinburgh, after taking his law degree in 1947 at University of Virginia, Spong was a bit surprised at the relative smallness of the law school, a facility of four for an enrollment of fewer than 50 law school students. This fall Marshall-Wythe had an undergraduate enrollment of 483, plus a dozen graduate students, as it began classes in the new building with a faculty of 24 full-time teachers and 15 part-time adjuncts. The new structure, including an elaborately equipped library and moot (or practice) courtroom uniquely rigged with video-taping and other electronic devices to help students see and hear themselves in mock trial grapplings, has a rated capacity of 600 students. Ideally, however, Spong thinks the undergraduate students mostly specializing in tax courses that distinguish the Marshall-Wythe curriculum, so as to preserve the closer student-faculty relationships of the moderately sized school. If the teacher-politician 2 ̆ 7 s memory goes back to the tiny school of 1948, it also spans the 19502 ̆ 7 s and 19602 ̆ 7 s, when Spong emerged as a promising 2 ̆ 2 Young Turk 2 ̆ 2 delegate and state senator with a special interest in education. His first political venture was to campaign vigorously in 1949 for the Byrd organization 2 ̆ 7 s gubernatorial candidate, John S. Battle, whose sons, John Jr. and William, were good friends of Spong from college and university days. With other generally Byrd-oriented young lawmakers, Spong joined in the successful 2 ̆ 2 Young Turk 2 ̆ 2 rebellion that jarred the penny-pinching old guard into spending more surplus funds for higher education at the 1954 legislative session. Then he upset a locally powerful Byrdman to win Portsmouth 2 ̆ 7 s Senate seat, which he held until he upset another ell-entrenched conservative back by the Byrd old guard in the 1966 Democratic primary for U. S. senator. Since the 1966 general election, in which Spong and Harry F. Byrd Jr. constituted the victorious Democratic ticket [...] with Spong the front-runner [...] no Democratic nominee for senator or governor has won in Virginia. Himself upset in 1972 by a most conservative Republican, Spong could trace his defeat to the burden of the McGovern presidential ticket, to a heavily-financed media blitz for his opponent [...] and perhaps to his own campaign mistakes. After the 1972 defeat, and after serving as general counsel to an important international study commission, and after resuming his private practice of law at Portsmouth, why did Spong choose the presumably less lucrative course of teach-dean at a small law school with a doubtful, if not precarious, future? 2 ̆ 2 Well, that 2 ̆ 7 s difficult to answer... I think I had done just about everything in the way of law practice that could come along in Portsmouth... And [...] oh, frankly, I just thought this offered the opportunity to be more useful. 2 ̆ 2 Which is better, politics or teaching? 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 ve enjoyed both [...] all of it. I 2 ̆ 7 ve enjoyed teaching, which I sought in the first place, to help me get established in the practice of law. I enjoyed the practice of law. And I always enjoyed politics [...] even though I wasn 2 ̆ 7 t a good politician... 2 ̆ 2 That led to more questions and answer about the mutualities of teaching and politicking. 2 ̆ 2 I think teachers should have more respect for politicians than they do. I think I understand people. I think the practice of law is dealing with people and the problems of people... I don 2 ̆ 7 t think a successful lawyer can be clinically detached from humanity, from people... 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 I think, if we are here to educate people to become lawyers and if we don 2 ̆ 7 t understand people, and understand their failings as well as their virtues, then we will be doing a less than complete job with the people we 2 ̆ 7 re trying to prepare for the practice of law... 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Politics can make you arrogant. It can also make you very humble. 2 ̆ 2 Looking back at the better politicians he had known, Spong thought they had at least one thing in common: 2 ̆ 2 a great understanding of what makes people tick. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 I think some measure of that imparted to students is a good thing. I don 2 ̆ 7 t think you have to lecture on the virtue of politics. I think how you lecture (as a law teacher) can try to relate it in human terms, rather than just as something out of a book. 2 ̆ 2 Somehow, the name of John Garland Pollard as a predecessor of Spong 2 ̆ 7 s as head of the law school came up. The reporter recalled hearing how Pollard, after winning the Virginia attorney general election in 1913, lost the primary election for governor in 1917 and then devoted himself to teaching law and government at William and Mary [...] only to be drafted by Gov. Byrd to reunite the Virginia Democratic Party and the Byrd organization as the 1929 gubernatorial nominee after the political disasters of the 1928 presidential election. Suppose some sort of similar call or draft came next year for Spong as a man who might pull the fractious Democrats together and lure back conservative strays to help win the 1981 gubernatorial election? 2 ̆ 2 Well, first of all, I don 2 ̆ 7 t think that 2 ̆ 7 s going to happen. In fact, I 2 ̆ 7 m so certain I don 2 ̆ 7 t think we ought to speculate about it. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 But even if it did, I 2 ̆ 7 ve sort of put my political days behind me, for two reasons. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 First, you cannot be a little bit in politics and do what I 2 ̆ 7 m <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here.</b> Politics is all consuming [...] you 2 ̆ 7 ve got to be prepared to give all the time it demands. 2 ̆ 2 That could only be to the detriment of what I 2 ̆ 7 ve been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here...</b> As a result, I 2 ̆ 7 m five years out of touch (with active politics)... I don 2 ̆ 7 t think that way any more, and I don 2 ̆ 7 t think I 2 ̆ 7 m thought of that way any more. Well, Pollard was 10 years out of touch, but he ran and won. But what was Spong 2 ̆ 7 s second reason? 2 ̆ 2 The other reason is that, having done what I 2 ̆ 7 ve done, I 2 ̆ 7 ve just sort of decided that, even if I were free from here, I would not be interested... 2 ̆ 2 If the retired politician had now become addicted to teaching, had he set any time period or goals for his work at William and Mary? 2 ̆ 2 No, as to time, but I think I will know when it 2 ̆ 7 s time to go. Yes, I wanted to accomplish certain things when I came here. The building was one of them. There are others, to improve and advance the law school, that I hope will be forthcoming in the near future. And I 2 ̆ 7 ll just decided what to do after that happens. 2 ̆...|$|E

Analisando e comparando a personagem com dois outros personagens masculinos do mesmo país de origem, época e editora, Super-Homem e Batman, tentando entender os diferentes níveis de poder entre eles e os caminhos pelos quais a heroína passou. As diferenças serão analisadas dentro e fora dos quadrinhos. Além disso, consideramos a evolução da mulher dentro do mesmo recorte {{temporal}} de análise da personagem, relacionando os dois mundos e suas múltiplas influências. A intenção é alimentar e ampliar os estudos historiográficos sobre uma história das mulheres e também de resgatar a presença da mulher na história. A análise tem um especial foco sobre o tratamento aplicado à Mulher-Maravilha pela indústria cultural no Brasil, especialmente na metade dos anos cinqüenta, quando a personagem foi lançada aqui. Igualmente importante é a discussão entre globalização e mundialização, mas, mais do que isso, os sinais, fatores e a estrutura de um novo arranjo planetário na economia, política e cultura. A globalização e o resgate da mulher na história são fatos quase contemporâneos. Este trabalho vai tentar mostrar questões para compreender ambos os fenômenos, com a análise da Mulher-Maravilha que pretendemos fazer aqui. This MA dissertation {{investigates the}} female presence, representation and significance in action comic books as heroes. The {{focus will be}} in Wonder Woman since 1941 to 2002. Analysing and comparing her character with two others big male characters from the same origin country, time and publishing company, Superman and Batman, we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> understand, the different levels of power {{between them and the}} ways that Wonder Woman to went through. These differences will be analysed inside and outside of the comics itself. Besides, this analysis is concerned on female evolution at the same period that Wonder Woman was created to the present. Our propose is to relate both worlds, the comic books and our world, and their mutual influences as well. These aspects are connected with the intention to provide and increase the historiography studies on a female history and also to rescue the female presence in history. The analysis has a special focus about the treatment applied to Wonder Woman by the cultural industry in Brazil. Equally important to this propose is the aspect about the last forty years (or near by) we have the process of global issues. A infinite discussion between global and worldwide matters but more than this, the signs, factors and structure from a new planetary arrangement in economy, politics and cultural aspects. The global process and the rescue of a female history are events almost contemporary.

40|$|From {{the time}} of the first loaning {{agreement}} between Greece and the EU in 2010 until now the country has faced a tremendous economic and social catastrophe. A lot of people in Greece among them major economists like Mr Varoufakis argue that the measures that the EU imposed on Greece in exchange for funding her were so harsh for the country,that resulted to the country being in depression, and if softer measures were taken, the country would be much better now. So the question is why Greek Government accepted so harsh measures? Could Greece do something better. So what we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is <b>to</b> describe, examine and analyse those negotiations through the use of non-cooperative game theory and by <b>doing</b> so <b>to</b> see whether or not the outcome of those negotiations make sense concerning our analysis with game theory. If not why is that and what else the EU and Greece could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> improve their position and achieve their goals. Specifically this essay is concerned with three different negotiations. The first are the negotiations concerning the first loaning agreement in 2010, the second are the negotiations between Greece and the EU on January and February of 2012 concerning the second loaning agreement and third are the negotiations that take place at the moment between Greece and the EU and they are concerned with the providing of an instalment of 30 billion euros to Greece in exchange for measures that will decrease Greece’s expenses by 12. 5 billion euros. Concerning the first loaning agreement the game that better describes her is the battle of sexes. The problem is that what happened in reality is not the same with what Game theory tell us should happen. The explanations we give are related with the inefficiency of Greek politicians that either considers anything that Europe says as credible or they never thought of disagreeing with the EU for reasons that are not related with non-cooperative game theory. Concerning the second loaning agreement the game that describes it better is the chicken. Again the final outcome of the negotiations is not one that a game theorist could expect. The explanation we give is that again Greek consider European /threats and commitments as credible either because they thought that the EU had an interest to look tough on the European countries. Even if that was the case clearly Greece could find ways to countermove that and furthermore could issue a threat for referendum that in our opinion would convince the EU to provide better terms to Greece. Finally concerning the current negotiations Greece is in a very good negotiating position and she could exploit the new program that ECB announced concerning the bonds of countries with problems even if she is not included in it. The example of Italy shows that if you negotiate well and 3 you issue credible threats you can achieve a lot. Greece by issuing threat that she will sue the EU in the European court of justice for being treated unequally with other states could push EU...|$|R

Natives sleep and lie about all over the place, and whole quarters are just so many rabbit-warrens. Wait till you see the Machua Bazar. Well, besides the petty theft and burglary, we have heavy cases of forgery and fraud, that leave us with our wits pitted against a Bengali's. When a Bengali criminal is working a fraud of the sort he loves, he is about the cleverest soul you could wish for. He gives us cases a year long to unravel. Then there are the murders in the low houses--very curious things they are. You'll see the house where Sheikh Babu was murdered presently, and you'll understand. The Burra Bazar and Jora Bagan sections are the two worst ones for heavy cases; but Colootollah is the most aggravating. There's Colootollah over yonder--that patch of darkness beyond the lights. That section is full of tuppenny-ha'penny petty cases, that keep the men up all night and make 'em swear. You'll see Colootollah, and then perhaps you'll understand. Bamun Bustee is the quietest of all, and Lal Bazar and Bow Bazar, as you can see for yourself, are the rowdiest. You've no notion what the natives come to the police station for. A man will come on and want a summons against his master for refusing him half-an-hour's leave.

The men clamber up, some one says softly, [...] "All ready there," [...] and with an angry whistle the fire-engine, followed by the other two, flies out into Lal Bazar. Time--1 min. 40 secs.
