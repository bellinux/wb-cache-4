40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown a {{positive}} association between both migration and <b>temporary</b> <b>expatriation</b> and HIV risk. This association {{is likely to be}} similar or even more pronounced for forced migrants. In general, HIV transmission in host-migrant or host-forced-migrant interactions depends on the maturity of the HIV epidemic in both the host and the migrant population, the relative seroprevalence of HIV in the host and the migrant population, the prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that may facilitate transmission, and the level of sexual interaction between the two communities. Complex emergencies are the major cause of mass population movement today. In complex emergencies, additional factors such as sexual interaction between forced-migrant populations and the military; sexual violence; increasing commercial sex work; psychological trauma; and disruption of preventive and curative health services may increase the risk for HIV transmission. Despite recent success in preventing HIV infection in stable populations in selected developing countries, internally displaced persons and refugees (or forced migrants) have not been systematically included in HIV surveillance systems, nor consequently in prevention activities. Standard surveillance systems that rely on functioning health services may not provide useful data in many complex emergency settings. Secondar...|$|E
40|$|Kerala {{had a long}} {{tradition}} of several centuries of international emigration. Nonetheless, since the 70 's, the flows have tremendously increased, and West Asia had appeared to be the main destination. Among the Gulf countries, the UAE have become the first host country for the Keralite migrants. Until the end of the 90 's, the migration was based on the principle of a <b>temporary</b> <b>expatriation</b> for an expected wealthy return. In other words, migrants used expatriation, with renewable employment contracts for a betterment of their financial situation as well as a skill experience in order to start a new professional life back in Kerala. Nevertheless, such a principle is now questioned by some socio-professional categories which consider emigration as an opportunity to become self-employed and entrepreneurs. The analysis of the entrepreneurial initiatives shows that different characteristics exist. Various strategies and routes appear in relation with the migratory context and the opportunities offered. In other respects, the emergence and the development of these new migrants' strategies have been facilitated by economic and political changes in the UAE. In fact, Dubai is asserting itself as a global city where a post-oil economy is arising. Moreover, the development of industrial and business activities in the Emirate prompts the closest ones, namely Sharjah and Ajman, to offer some attractive advantages for business investments. Combined with such an economic evolution, the immigration policy evolves towards a more favourable situation for entrepreneurial initiatives within the migrants' communities. Finally, the impact of the relations between India and the Gulf region is also at stake...|$|E
40|$|More {{than three}} million Greek Orthodox people exited Hellas, {{during the last}} four hundred years, {{in an effort to}} fulfil their {{personal}} ambition to amass wealth or to survive as the consequence of a long period of foreign domination and financial constraints. They have settled almost in every single neighbourhoods of the world, thus forming the Hellenic Orthodox Diaspora. The term Diaspora was first used by Thucydides to describe the exile (dispersion) of the people of Aegina by the Athenians (Thucydides, Peloponnesian War, and II. 27). Greek Orthodox, despite their <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>expatriation</b> to foreign lands for any reason, continued to maintain cultural, political, economic or social relations with their country of ancestry and descent. During this period, Greek expatriation has been an intense phenomenon claiming more than 40 % of the Greeks residing, at any given time, outside the national borders of Greece or Cyprus. In 2007, of the 17, 000, 000 Greeks, an estimated total of 5, 000, 000 are residing in 150 different countries of the world. ISBN: 978052186407...|$|R
