5|$|The British {{policy of}} salutary neglect for its North American colonies {{intended}} to minimise <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{as a way}} of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain's formal acknowledgement of the United States' sovereignty {{at the end of the}} American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese {{surrendered}} in 1945, Japanese business {{enterprises and}} organisations in Palau closed, effectively ending the Japanese influence on Palau's economy. In {{the first two}} decades after the war, the American occupation government imposed strict <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> with Japan. Contact with Japan was reestablished in the 1960s, starting with Okinawan fishermen who were granted fishing rights. Japanese tourists began to visit Palau in increasing numbers from the mid-1970s. The growing influx of tourists to Palau led to the restoration of heritage sites around Palau, particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the Japanese era as well as Palauan longhouses to accommodate {{to the interests of}} Japanese tourists, which accounted for half of all visiting tourists. Many of Palau's tourist sites were run and maintained by Palauan citizens of Japanese-Palauan heritage, whose knowledge in Japanese and Palauan customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of Japanese tourists.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> on corporate risk-taking. Using a cross-country sample of 38 countries over the 1990 to 2003 period, we find that corporate risk-taking is positively related to insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions.</b> This finding is robust to alternative regression specifications and sample periods, {{to the use of}} alternative measures of insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> and risk-taking incentives, and to controls for possible endogeneity. Further investigation suggests that the relation between insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> and corporate risk-taking is influenced by cross-sectional differences in stock market development and legal origin, and that the increase in risk-taking is beneficial to firms. In conclusion, this paper highlights the role of insider <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> as an important determinant of corporate risk-taking...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{in other}} countries, {{negotiated}} block shares have huge discounts in China. We argue that <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{help to explain}} this puzzle. Block shares in China face <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> in the open market and can only be traded {{in the form of}} block transfers at negotiated prices. Using a dataset of 233 block transfers in China between 2002 and 2003, we find that discounts on block share prices increase with the proportion of restricted shares in the ownership. The likelihood of private benefit of control has positive impact on block prices, but the effect diminishes when there are other large shareholders. Furthermore, private institutions offer a higher price than state-owned institutions. G 30 G 12 <b>Trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> Block shares Private benefit of control...|$|R

5|$|In 173, the Quadi rebelled and overthrew Furtius, who {{was their}} client-king {{appointed}} {{to them by}} Rome, and replaced him with Ariogaesus, who wanted {{to enter into negotiations}} with Marcus. As the success of the Marcomannic wars was in no danger, Marcus refused to negotiate. At that point only the Iazyges had not yet been defeated by Rome. Judging from the lack of action on Marcus Aurelius' part, it appears he was unconcerned, but when the Iazyges attacked across the frozen Danube in late 173 and early 174, Marcus redirected his attention to them. <b>Trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the Marcomanni were also partially lifted at that timethey were allowed to visit the Roman markets at certain times of certain days. In an attempt to force Marcus to negotiate, Ariogaesus began to support the Iazyges. Marcus Aurelius put out a bounty on him, offering 1,000 aurei for his capture and delivery to Rome, or 500 aurei for his severed head. After this, Ariogaesus was captured by the Romans, but rather than executing him, Marcus Aurelius sent him into exile.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, James Alexander Holden {{emigrated to}} South Australia from Walsall, England and in 1856 {{established}} J.A. Holden & Co, a saddlery business in Adelaide. In 1885, German-born H. A.

From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery. The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages. After 1917, wartime <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A.

From 1987 on, insiders are no longer allowed to trade two months before an annual earnings announcement.

The tighter are the <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the higher are the costs that are due to forgone gains from trade. Our analysis of the trade-offs involved shows that firms benefit from IP-for-IP restrictions, compared to both free trade and no trade environments, in industries where: (1) firms differ in their capabilities to commercialize IP; and (2) patent complementarities exist...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{usefulness}} of the option-based framework of Longstaff (1995) to estimate the effect of <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the value of common stock. Longstaff’s fundamental insight is that marketability can be viewed as an option to sell an asset at the time of one’s choosing, so the value of marketability can be estimated using techniques from option pricing. Among other things, Longstaff’s model assumes a frictionless market where an investor with perfect timing ability will sell an asset and invest the proceeds to maximize the value of a portfolio. When there are restrictions on selling the asset, this investor is unable to optimize his/her wealth. Longstaff derives the resulting loss in value due to the <b>restriction</b> on <b>trading,</b> which varies with the risk of the asset. Analyzing a sample of 194 private placements of common stock in the United States from January 27, 2000 through March 27, 2008, we find empirical evidence that both volatility and <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> are related to the percentage discount for on private placements. We categorize <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> as one of two types: either liquidity or marketability. Using a Chow test to identify a structural break in the data, we find that the importance of marketability restrictions (e. g., the number of shares in the private placement relative to the total shares outstanding) is significant for private placements occurring in the last four and one half years of the sample period whereas, during {{the first part of the}} sample period, characteristics related liquidity (e. g., turnover and the bid-ask spread) are more important as determinants of discounts on private placements. <b>Trading</b> <b>Restrictions</b> and Value: Marketability as an Option 2 1...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>trade</b> <b>restriction</b> is an {{artificial}} <b>restriction</b> on the <b>trade</b> of goods and/or services between two countries. It is the byproduct of protectionism.

For instance Germany required the production of beer to adhere to its purity law.

25|$|The Swans' {{continued}} {{period of}} success, {{in which it}} has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a salary cap concession which the club receives; the concession {{is in the form of}} an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city. It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped. The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000). During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions,</b> labeling the ban as a restraint of trade. In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA, the league further relaxed the <b>trade</b> <b>restrictions</b> for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for Callum Sinclair in a swap deal, as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, Michael Talia from the Western Bulldogs.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new measure {{capturing}} three dimensions of <b>trading</b> <b>restriction</b> tightness: <b>trading</b> quantity, speed, and cost. By using this new measure, we document {{a positive effect}} of restriction tightness on illiquidity discounts of restricted shares relative to their liquid counterparts, inferred from Division Reform, a market-level process of releasing <b>trading</b> <b>restrictions</b> in China Stock Market. We also justify the 38. 65 % illiquidity discount by comparing it with results from theoretical models, finding that it lies below the 48. 67 % upper bound suggested by Longstaff (1995) and it falls within the range between 23. 82 % and 41. 70 % suggested by Longstaff (2001). We conclude that the considerations paid in Division Reform are adequate in general and relative wealth of two classes of shareholders remains after the trading constraints are released...|$|R
