5|$|Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel {{long before}} Lucas would shoot it. They trained {{extensively}} with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As {{in the previous}} two prequel films, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes {{without the use of}} stunt doubles. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E

5|$|Possibly due to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> she was constructed, Tsukuba {{reportedly}} {{suffered from}} numerous defects. Shortly {{after she was}} completed in 1907, the ship sailed for America where she participated in the Jamestown Exposition Naval Review in May. The ship then sailed to Europe where she made numerous port visits {{over the next several}} months. While in Britain, Tsukuba was fitted with a Vickers fire-control system that calculated the firing data for each gun and with which the gunnery officer fired the guns in unison. Ikoma visited England in July 1910 as part of the Japan–British Exhibition.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, {{leading to the}} development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved {{with the use of the}} rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon. Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> ships could be sailed.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} concerns {{for the design of}} venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a very long time to disperse from a badly designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.|$|E

5|$|On {{water-based}} pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce {{friction and}} increase <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, {{during and after}} the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile third-generation or 3G pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon Sagas battles {{take place}} while flying on the dragon. They mix {{real-time}} and turn-based elements, with three action gauges that charge in real time. When a gauge fills, the player {{can make a}} move, such as attacking or using an item such as a shield or poison cure. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates more options, such as making multiple moves in quick succession, but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's agility attribute; if this {{is higher than the}} enemy's agility attribute, the player can make moves more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|The main {{character}} possesses several statistics, including hit points, power, and stamina, which can all increase upon gaining an experience level. Magic spells, which expend the character's MP, {{can be used}} to heal oneself or damage enemies. These spells can only be found in certain locations or obtained from other characters at specific plot intervals. In addition, the protagonist has a power gauge that affects his attack strength—the higher the gauge, the stronger his attack will be. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> it fills is directly affected by the character's will level. The gauge will slowly fill up over time, but once the {{main character}} attacks, the gauge is emptied. When the gauge is completely filled up and the main character attacks with a weapon, he will perform a special attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> welds are {{performed in the}} steel erection industry comes at a risk {{to the integrity of}} the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood's {{attack was}} so {{successful}} that by dawn on 31 March Guillaume Tell had lost its main and mizen topmasts and its main yard, considerably reducing <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> Decrés could travel. The French ship had also suffered heavy casualties in the exchange, but Penelope had lost only one man killed and three wounded, and was almost undamaged. British reinforcements were now arriving from the south: the 64-gun HMS Lion under Captain Dixon had received Minorcas warning at 01:00 and immediately sailed in pursuit, sending the brig on to Captain Sir Edward Berry in HMS Foudroyant, who lay some distance to leeward. By 05:00, Dixon {{was close enough to}} engage, passing between Penelope and Guillaume Tell and firing a triple-shotted broadside into the port side of the French ship. Shooting ahead of the now sluggish Guillaume Tell, Lion crossed its opponent's bows and shot away the jib boom, allowing Dixon to maintain a position across the bow, raking the French ship from one end while Penelope did the same to the other. During these manoeuvres, Dixon's ship had briefly become entangled with Guillaume Tells rigging, and two determined efforts to board the British ship had been driven off as the ships were disentangled.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3s {{story or}} {{campaign}} mode {{can be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior.

5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and {{is quite different from the}} sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E
