25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E
500|$|Let {{the object}} of affection be {{snatched}} away by death, and how is all the pain ever inflicted upon them avenged! The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, {{now that they are}} forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ... How did I feel this when my daughter, Allegra, died! While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I could not live without her.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows {{him into an}} open field, where Yemi tells him {{it is time for}} Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E

500|$|During filming, Gillian Anderson {{was unsure}} how exactly to perform her lines. She noted, [...] "the way the script was {{originally}} read to me, initially seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Scully kind of {{stepped up to}} the plate and played along with the sheriff's humor". She reportedly performed her lines in a [...] "tongue in cheek"-esque way before receiving a call from Carter. He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to [...] "edit out a lot of stuff" [...] in order to make up for this. Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen. The scenes required the store to be closed before Christmas and be installed with up-right freezers.|$|E
500|$|Bülow was {{committed}} to Wagner's music; in 1858 he had undertaken the preparation of a vocal score for Tristan und Isolde, and by 1862 {{he was making a}} [...] of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. A social relationship developed, and during the summer of 1862 the Bülows stayed with Wagner at the composer's home at Biebrich. Wagner records that Cosima became [...] "transfigured" [...] by his rendering of [...] "Wotan's Farewell" [...] from Die Walküre. In October 1862, just after Blandine's death, Wagner and Bülow shared conducting duties at a concert in Leipzig; Wagner records that, during a rehearsal, [...] "I felt utterly transported by the sight of Cosima ... she appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> stepping from another world". In these years Wagner's emotional life was in disarray. He was still married to his first wife, Minna Planer (she was to die in 1866), and was involved in several extramarital relationships. On 28 November 1863 Wagner visited Berlin; while Bülow was rehearsing a concert, Wagner and Cosima took a long cab ride through Berlin and declared their feelings for each other: [...] "with tears and sobs", Wagner later wrote, [...] "we sealed our confession to belong to each other alone".|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth's {{life changed}} irrevocably on 11 September 1227 when Louis, {{en route to}} join the Sixth Crusade, died of a fever in Otranto, Italy, {{just a few weeks}} before the birth of her {{daughter}} Gertrude. [...] Upon hearing the news of her husband's death, Elizabeth reportedly said, [...] "He is dead. He is dead. It is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whole world died today." [...] His remains were returned to Elizabeth in 1228 and entombed at the Abbey of Reinhardsbrunn.|$|E

2500|$|John {{declared}} {{that he did not}} worship matter, [...] "but rather the creator of matter." [...] He also declared, [...] "But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> filled with divine energy and grace." [...] He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the body and blood of Jesus. [...] This distinction between worship and veneration is key in the arguments of the iconodules.|$|E
2500|$|Out of this {{situation}} evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable {{growth in the number}} of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.|$|E
2500|$|Goforth ministered at Yingkou (Newchwang), {{the final}} resting-place of Scottish missionary William Chalmers Burns. Burns’ impact {{was still being}} felt 40 years later among the Christian {{community}} of Yingkou. However, {{the same kind of}} repentance and prayer broke out, here as Goforth wrote: [...] "On entering the pulpit, I bowed as usual for a few moments in prayer. When I looked up it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> every last man, woman and child in that church was in the throes of judgment. Tears were flowing freely, and all manner of sin was being confessed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't he {{kind and}} good?" [...] Mary said, enthusiastically, {{as she watched}} the {{greeting}} which he received, as he landed. [...] "He talked <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had been of my own family." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Too bad! too bad!" [...] and {{the master}} of the Hall showed his disappointment. He heaved a sigh. [...] "It looks <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Brice, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had made a mistake in giving Brown and Martell another chance." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson chose [...] "Montaigne; or, the Skeptic" [...] as {{a subject}} {{of one of his}} series of lectures {{entitled}} Representative Men, alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. In [...] "The Skeptic" [...] Emerson writes of his experience reading Montaigne, [...] "It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had myself written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience." [...] Friedrich Nietzsche judged of Montaigne: [...] "That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth". Sainte-Beuve advises us that [...] "to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments, let us read every evening a page of Montaigne." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regine outlived Kierkegaard {{by almost}} a half century; {{she died in}} March 1904 {{at the age of}} eighty-two. Johannes Hohlenberg {{preserved}} a letter she wrote to Henrik Lund, Kierkegaard’s nephew, in which she said, “His death filled me not only with sorrow but with concern, as though by postponing action I had committed a great injustice against him. …. But since his death, it has seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a duty I had neglected from cowardice; a duty not only towards him, but towards God, to whom he sacrificed me, whether he did it from an innate tendency to self-torment (a misgiving he himself had), or whether, as I think time and the results of his work will show, from a higher call from God.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I was {{learning}} {{it for the first}} time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E
60|$|You {{never saw}} such an {{expression}} of amazement as was on that poor man's face. He looked from <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Alberta and from Alberta to Elizabeth and from Elizabeth <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he doubted the evidence of his eyes.|$|R

60|$|Dick's face clouded over; {{he got up}} {{and walked}} around the room several times before he said a word. Then he came and sat down beside me and {{explained}} it all <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were grown up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know about}} that," [...] {{returned}} Davis. [...] "Appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it might be}} worse. 'Tain't worth what the cargo would have been, of course, at least not money down. But I'll {{tell you what it}} appears to figure up to.

60|$|There is no {{good reason}} why I should strive to set down all the doings of each day while it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> our people were making slow {{progress}} in this work of capturing my Lord Cornwallis.|$|R
60|$|A faint brazen {{reverberation}} {{from out}} of the distance increased in intensity and died away. It was Adam performing on the gong.

6000|$|... "It {{might have}} been as you say. There was a strange, rough bashfulness about him. He {{confused}} and puzzled me. He never spoke out. He seemed <b>to</b> treat <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> our future lives had been provided for while we were children. What could I do, Lucy?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt the}} need to say something, because he hung on <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> lost, {{breathing}} heavily.|$|E

6000|$|She {{does not}} come <b>to</b> greet <b>me</b> so frankly <b>as</b> she did, [...] And in her utmost {{openness}} I feel there's something hid; [...] She almost seems <b>to</b> shun <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she thought that I [...] Might win her gentle heart again to feelings long gone by.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't know. <b>To</b> <b>me</b> he {{appeared}} <b>to</b> have grown less springy of step, heavier in body, less keen of eye. Imagination, no doubt; {{but it seems}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the net of fate had been drawn closer round him already.|$|R
5000|$|... “Successive New Zealand {{governments have}} tried hard <b>to</b> {{discredit}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I {{was some sort}} of communist threat to them or a traitor.
