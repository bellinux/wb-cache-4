50|$|As of 2014, Canada {{had more}} fringe theatre festivals {{than any other}} country, forming a summer fringe circuit running from <b>the</b> St-Ambroise Montréal <b>Fringe</b> in June and heading westward to <b>the</b> Vancouver <b>Fringe</b> Festival in September.

5|$|Eventually, several {{independent}} {{groups of}} experimenters in the mid-60s realized that <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> encoded important information about dimensional changes {{occurring in the}} subject, and began intentionally producing holographic double exposures.

5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting <b>the</b> <b>fringes.</b> The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of their environments. Geographically and climatically we expect this, as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards <b>the</b> <b>fringes,</b> as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work in tracking bee colony changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species to build the body of research on the impact of climate change on bees.|$|E

5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of <b>the</b> <b>fringes,</b> so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's other {{compositions}} {{during the}} war included incidental music for a children's play, The Starlight Express (1915); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan (1917); and The Spirit of England (1915–17, to poems by Laurence Binyon), three choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his earlier years. His last large-scale composition of the war years was <b>The</b> <b>Fringes</b> of the Fleet, settings of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres.

5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Menage {{returned}} to Minneapolis {{and entered the}} real estate business with partner H. C. Brackett.

He also worked with Thomas Lowry, head of the city's streetcar system, to ensure that new lines were built to serve the outlying areas he was developing. Much of the present day Prospect Park neighborhood, and the areas surrounding Lake Harriet and Lake Calhoun, were developed by Menage and his companies.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Africa, {{birds of}} both the European subspecies P. d. domesticus and the Indian subspecies P. d. indicus were introduced around 1900. Birds of P. d. domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns, while P. d. indicus birds have spread rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this success, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur in towns, competing successfully with it. In South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common {{in most of the}} southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from Tierra del Fuego to <b>the</b> <b>fringes</b> of the Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.|$|E
