25|$|The {{turning point}} of Rice's {{ministry}} was {{the arrival of}} two young men, Thomas Grosvenor and Patrick Finn, from his hometown of Callan. They came to him with the desire of joining a congregation, but had not decided which they would join. As it turned out, they remained to teach at Edmund Rice's school, and formed their own. The subsequent success of the New Street school led to a more permanent building, christened 'Mount Sion', where construction began on 1 June 1802. The Mount Sion monastery was officially blessed by Bishop Thomas Hussey on 7 June 1803. Since the schoolhouse was not yet completed, Rice, Finn, and Grosvenor took up residence but walked each day from Mt Sion <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> on New Street and Stephen Street. On 1 May 1804, the adjoining school was opened and blessed by Hussey's successor, Bishop John Power, and their pupils transferred to the new building.|$|E
25|$|Master of Magic splits spells {{into six}} schools of magic: Life Magic, which heals and protects; its antithesis Death Magic, which drains life and creates undead; Chaos Magic, which warps targets and spews {{destructive}} energies; Nature Magic, which controls {{the weather and}} turns it against the enemy; Sorcery, which manipulates the air and subverts {{the effects of the}} other schools; and Arcane Magic, which is a general school and free for all. Players select spellbooks from desired schools, allowing them to research and cast spells from those schools. The number of spells a wizard could learn from each school was dependent upon the number of books taken for that school. Additionally, the player could select traits instead of additional spellbooks. These traits would provide a special bonus throughout the game. There are global spells that can affect targets all across the world. Unit or city enhancement spells can boost the potential of its target, such as increasing the movement and attack speed of units, enabling them to regenerate wounds, and increasing the power of their attacks. Wizards can summon fantastic creatures related <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools.</b> The player can research combat spells, which include direct attacks, debuffs and traps. The final spell learned is the Arcane Spell of Mastery, which takes enormous resources to research and cast but instantly wins the game for the casting player.|$|E
