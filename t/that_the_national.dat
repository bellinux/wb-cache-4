In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E

Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way.

5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 years old. With the active interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E

The House adjourned June 28, 1783, and Breckinridge returned to William and Mary, studying {{through the end of}} the year, excepting the legislative session in November and December. With the war over, he urged that no economic or political penalties be imposed on former Loyalists. In contrast to his later political views, he desired a stronger central government than provided for in the Articles of Confederation; he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> government could not survive unless it could tax its citizens, a power it did not have under the Articles.|$|E
