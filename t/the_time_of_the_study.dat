5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E
25|$|Rats in New York City are prevalent, {{as in many}} densely {{populated}} areas. For a long time, the number of rats in New York City was unknown, and a common urban legend {{was that there were}} up to five times as many rats as people. In 2014, however, scientists more accurately measured the entire city's rat population to be approximately only 20% of the number of humans; i.e., there were approximately 2 million rats to New York's 8.4 million people at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
25|$|We have {{examined}} the two forms of landholding and tenancy in the Haya system of land tenure. Although they co-exist, they have different bases, the one as {{an aspect of the}} traditional structure and the other as an aspect of the structure developing at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> The significance of each derives from the particular characteristics of Haya land which is valuable but limited in quantity. In the traditional structure, the land formed the base or medium through which the institution of clientship was expressed and some land is still held under this form of tenure. In the developing structure, the pressure on the land makes for heterogeneous arrangements, here considered under the rubric of the relatively new form of tenure.|$|E

25|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by Women in the Fire Service in 1995, 551 women in fire departments across the U.S were asked about their experiences with sexual harassment {{and other forms of}} job discrimination. Eighty-eight percent of fire service women responding had experienced some form of sexual harassment {{at some point in their}} fire service careers or volunteer time. Nearly seventy percent of the women in the survey said they were experiencing ongoing harassment at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Of the 339 women who said they had complained about harassment, only a third (115 women) listed only positive outcomes: investigating/taking care of the problem, and disciplining the harasser. Twenty-six percent said they were retaliated against for reporting the incident.|$|E
25|$|Homology {{models can}} also be used to {{identify}} subtle differences between related proteins that have not all been solved structurally. For example, the method was used to identify cation binding sites on the Na+/K+ ATPase and to propose hypotheses about different ATPases' binding affinity. Used in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations, homology models can also generate hypotheses about the kinetics and dynamics of a protein, as in studies of the ion selectivity of a potassium channel. Large-scale automated modeling of all identified protein-coding regions in a genome has been attempted for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulting in nearly 1000 quality models for proteins whose structures had not yet been determined at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> and identifying novel relationships between 236 yeast proteins and other previously solved structures.|$|E

Lahars from Glacier Peak pose a similar {{threat to the}} small communities of Darrington and Concrete and a lesser threat to the larger and rapidly growing towns of Mount Vernon and Burlington, {{as well as other}} communities along the lower Skagit and Stillaguamish Rivers.

2500|$|A {{study was}} carried out by Costanza and colleagues to {{determine}} the 'price' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context. [...] Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total GDP of the world at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> [...] This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some environmental economists - for being inconsistent with assumptions of financial capital valuation - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.|$|E

2500|$|The {{potential}} problem with sustainability standards is that projects {{will be more}} costly and projects will become cost prohibitive. [...] While units that are built will be higher efficiency, the {{number of available units}} could decrease because of costs. A 2009 study prepared by Davis Langdon examines the effect of green standards on the costs of affordable housing projects in Seattle and Portland. This study compared “standard housing projects” (i.e. projects with no explicit sustainability goals) and projects attempting to achieve Built Green or LEED certification. The study includes both public and private affordable housing projects. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> both cities had high sustainability standards for public projects, and Washington has only increased that standard since then. Construction cost analysis (in terms of cost per square foot) showed no significant difference between standard projects and green-rated projects. The study is limited by a small sample size, because of which they couldn’t compare public and privately funded projects.|$|E
