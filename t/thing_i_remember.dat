500|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{having had}} a really {{depressing}} effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|On the bridge, Beyoncé sings {{about having}} drunken {{sex in the}} kitchen: [...] "We {{woke up in the}} kitchen saying / How the hell did this shit happen / Oh baby, drunk in love, we be all night / Last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> is our {{beautiful}} bodies grinding off in that club". The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house. During his lines, he raps about [...] "reppin' that Third", a reference to the Third Ward area located in Houston.|$|E
500|$|The hotpants {{were deemed}} [...] "iconic" [...] and {{were said to}} be the reason behind [...] "Spinning Around" [...] {{becoming}} a [...] "musical and visual anthem in 2000." [...] According to the catalogue entry for the hotpants at the Performing Arts Collection at the Arts Centre, Melbourne, British artist and photographer Katerina Jebb bought them for fifty pence from a flea market and they were only selected for use in the video the night before the shoot, though Minogue had worn them previously for a website photoshoot. She was surprised by the attention they attracted, commenting [...] "I never imagined what impact a 50p pair of hotpants would have." [...] She also said that the revealing nature of the hotpants made her feel insecure during the shooting, saying [...] "I actually wasn't confident , that's the crazy <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> feeling quite self-conscious and kept wrapping a robe around me on set and would discard [...] right before the take." [...] The garment {{is often referred to as}} [...] "those hotpants," [...] and have become a symbol for the singer's vitality and youthfulness. Considered to be one of her trademark looks, the attire she wore in the music video was put on display at Kylie: The Exhibition, an exhibition that featured [...] "costumes and memorabilia collected over Kylie's career", held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, and at Kylie: An Exhibition, a similar exhibition held at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia. It was also included in Minogue's official fashion photography book Kylie / Fashion, which was released on 19 November 2012 by Thames and Hudson to celebrate Minogue's completion of [...] In February 2014, Minogue donated the hotpants to the Performing Arts Collection museum at the Arts Centre in her hometown of Melbourne.|$|E
6000|$|... "Angela {{declared}} {{that she was}} jealous, ungenerous, unforgiving--all sorts of <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> she said 'I am very false,' and I think she remarked that she was cruel." ...|$|R
60|$|The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> before {{dropping}} into dreamless slumber was hearing a bell tinkle in the forest, which I {{recognized as the}} one I had placed on Satan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yessir! First <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{was that}} <b>I</b> {{was born at}} Springfield, Ohio. It was like a mist {{starting}} to life. Springfield, Ohio. That was it. It suddenly came back to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Pictures of Baltz {{appeared}} on many front pages {{around the world}} such as the Syracuse Post-Standard, repeating a story from the Associated Press in which he expressed concern about his mother, who {{was waiting for him}} at the airport. He gave the only passenger description of the crash: [...] "I heard a big noise while we were flying. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> was the plane falling".|$|E
2500|$|Jahvid Best, {{a former}} {{starting}} running {{back for the}} Detroit Lions, visited Autzen while playing for the California Golden Bears in 2007. [...] He later said, [...] "The biggest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> about that game is the crowd. The crowd noise is crazy up there. Honestly, any other away game I don't really even hear the crowd. Oregon {{was the only place}} where it really got on my nerves." ...|$|E
2500|$|All I can {{remember}} is, Bob Willis had this big inswinging, in-dipping action," [...] Darling says. [...] "The ball was pitched well outside off stump {{was the last}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> Once it swung in, it also cut in further. I was caught in no man's land. I was sort of caught out of position, and hit in the chest. Unfortunately, at the time, I was chewing a chewy, and I swallowed my tongue and chewy as well. That caused me to black out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack," [...] I cried, [...] "so you HAVE done; so you HAVE {{brought all}} back to me! My Second State's over: I'm the same girl {{you used to}} know at Torquay once more. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> everything--everything--such a world--such a lifetime! I feel as if my head would burst with all the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{know what to do}} with it. I'm so tired, so weary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dresses ARE nice. <b>I</b> love pretty <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{the first}} pretty dress I ever had--the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our school concert. Before that {{everything}} I had was so ugly. It {{seemed to me}} that I stepped into a new world that night." ...|$|R
60|$|These <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> and {{likewise}} sobbing myself {{to sleep in}} the four-poster. Often since I have wished that I had questioned Breed of many <b>things</b> on which <b>I</b> had no curiosity then, for he was my chief companion in the weeks that followed. He awoke me bright and early the next day.|$|R
2500|$|The Choctaw people {{continued}} to struggle economically due to bigotry, cultural isolation, {{and lack of}} jobs. The Choctaw, who for 150 years had been neither white nor black, were [...] "left where they had always been"—in poverty. Will D. Campbell, a Baptist minister and Civil Rights activist, witnessed the destitution of the Choctaw. He would later write, [...] "the <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the most ... was the depressing sight of the Choctaws, their shanties along the country roads, grown men lounging on the dirt streets of their villages in demeaning idleness, sometimes drinking from a common bottle, sharing a roll-your-own cigarette, their half-clad children a picture of hurting that would never end." [...] With reorganization and establishment of tribal government, however, over the next decades they took control of [...] "schools, health care facilities, legal and judicial systems, and social service programs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phillip Martin, who {{had served}} in the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II, {{returned}} to visit his former Neshoba County, Mississippi home. [...] After seeing the poverty of his people, he decided to stay to help. Martin served as chairperson in various Choctaw committees up until 1977. Martin was elected as Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. He served a total of 30 years, being re-elected until 2007. Will D. Campbell, a Baptist minister and Civil Rights activist, witnessed the destitution of the Choctaw. He would later write, [...] "the <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the most ... was the depressing sight of the Choctaws, their shanties along the country roads, grown men lounging on the dirt streets of their villages in demeaning idleness, sometimes drinking from a common bottle, sharing a roll-your-own cigarette, their half-clad children a picture of hurting that would never end." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Lady Mary {{took the}} hand held out to her. [...] "Of course," [...] said the Lady Mary; [...] "how stupid of me! It {{was the day}} of my own wedding, too. You really must forgive me. We talked of {{quite a lot of}} <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now." ...|$|R
60|$|We covered twenty-two miles by sundown, {{a rather}} poor day's showing; and camped {{on the bare}} flat desert, using water and wood we had packed with us. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> as my eyes closed heavily, was what a blessing it was to rest and to sleep.|$|R
50|$|Following a Christmas season {{record in}} 2003, Songs For The Advent, Cosper, Quillo, Morris and Sojourn musicians began {{recording}} a Psalm-based record which delved into several folk musical styles in America {{and around the}} world. While Quillo still sang and wrote songs for the album, entitled These <b>Things</b> <b>I</b> <b>Remember,</b> fellow worship leader Rebecca Dennison led half the songs and contributed music she wrote by herself and with Cosper. Sojourn released These <b>Things</b> <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> in early 2005, dedicating it to Sojourn member Aaron Marrs, a graphic artist and film-maker whose ship was lost at sea while he was filming a documentary about crab {{fishing off the coast}} of Alaska. Marrs had designed the artwork for many Gotee Records albums, including releases by John Reuben and Relient K.|$|R
6000|$|FITZSIMMONS. There is one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> very distinctly. Harry Jones had a birth mark on his knee. [He {{looks at}} her legs searchingly.] ...|$|E
60|$|JUDITH (wearily). Then {{you were}} here: that's the next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> I suppose I fainted. Now bid me goodbye, Tony. Perhaps I shall faint again. I wish I could die.|$|E
6000|$|... "The only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{was a sort}} {{of green}} light--very clouded, very dim--which came up from the well. Not a fixed light, but {{intermittent}} and irregular--quite unlike anything I had ever seen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nien Nunb has {{received}} positive acclaim from Kenyan audiences for speaking {{the language of}} Kikuyu. Star Wars actress Lupita Nyong'o even acknowledged this, stating [...] "...One of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> as a child connecting with Star Wars {{is one of the}} characters spoke Kikuyu, which is a Kenyan language. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> feeling like that made Star Wars mine...".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; one doesn't {{ride over}} {{a man in}} cold-blood for nothing. I think he had some cause for being afraid of Lisle; several <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now point to it. His chance came suddenly--nobody could have {{arranged}} it--he only remembered that Lisle with his brains crushed out could do him no harm." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{culminates in}} the adult Tom narrating, [...] "Of all the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> about my childhood, this is what <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the most." [...] The eight-year-old Tom wakes up {{early in the morning}} to see the light to the {{backyard}} shed on and enters to find that Rose has hanged herself. Although she does not die initially, Bill receives a phone call later on confirming her death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I got uneasy. People {{seemed to}} be {{watching}} me. It scared me--badly." [...] She put {{her hand to her}} head. [...] "It's almost the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> before waking up in the hospital...." ...|$|E
60|$|The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> was the {{appearance}} of Sammy, looking very smart, in his blue cotton smock, who, now that the fighting was over, emerged like a butterfly when the sun shines after rain.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the last}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> {{wondering}} if you would. You seemed such miles and miles away. It was like looking at something in a mist through {{the wrong end of}} a telescope. Oh, Kirk!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I {{know what}} you were thinking? Heaven knows I didn't dream of such a <b>thing!</b> Though <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> now, your saying"-- ...|$|R
60|$|Such {{are some}} of the <b>things</b> that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> about this journey, but to tell truth I paid little {{attention}} to them and many others.|$|R
5000|$|... "Losing by {{a quarter}} of an inch, that was the worst," [...] Lee remembered. [...] "That was my only loss at NCAAs {{and is one of the}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> most about my time at LSU. And it really wasn't long after I got to LSU just a couple months before in January of that year. I think (Nicola Martial) was from Grenada in the Caribbean, so we sort of had a {{connection}} there too." ...|$|R
60|$|The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> was Cavalcanti's laugh, as, {{from the}} high ground we had mounted, he stopped to survey a ruddy glare above the city of Piacenza, where, in a vomit of sparks, Cosimo's fine palace was being consumed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Quatermain," [...] she said, [...] "I {{suppose that}} I {{must have been}} ill, for the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> is going {{to sleep on the}} night after you started for the {{hippopotamus}} hunt.

6000|$|The next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{is that it}} was morning: breakfast {{was just}} over: Sylvie was lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying to a Spaniel, who was {{regarding}} them with a most benevolent smile, [...] "Yes, thank you we've had a very nice breakfast. Haven't we, Bruno?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{lay down}} to sleep with the great blue expanse open to my eyes. The stars were very large, and wonderfully bright, yet they seemed so much farther off than I had ever seen them. The wind softly sifted the sand. I hearkened to the tinkle of the cowbells on the hobbled horses. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> was old Moze {{creeping}} close to my side, seeking the warmth of my body.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{shook his}} head again. [...] "The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can <b>remember,</b> Harry," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "was imploring you not to drink any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in my sleep," [...] she answered, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "but at night, when {{everything}} is quiet, the sea calls and calls, and I cannot rest. I woke suddenly this morning at three o'clock, and I went out. Powers, as I walked and listened, {{the wind and the}} sea came to me like old friends. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> many strange <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> people whose graves the sea has stolen from the land ages ago. I was back in those days myself, Powers. I sang their songs, my heart beat with their joys." ...|$|R
