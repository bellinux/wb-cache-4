40|$|Splines {{are part}} of the {{standard}} toolbox for the approximation of functions and curves in Rd. Still, the problem of finding the spline that best approximates an input function or curve is ill-posed, since in general this yields a “spline ” with an infinite number of segments. The problem can be regularized by adding a penalty term for the number of spline segments. We show how this idea can be formulated as an 0 -regularized quadratic problem. This gives us a notion of optimal approximating splines that depend on one parameter, which weights the approximation error against the number of segments. We detail this concept for different types of splines including B-splines and composite Bézier curves. Based on the latest development in the field of sparse approximation, we devise a solver for the resulting minimization problems and show applications <b>to</b> <b>spline</b> approximation of planar and space curves and <b>to</b> <b>spline</b> conversion of motion capture data...|$|E

40|$|Spline curves, {{originally}} developed by numerical analysts for interpolation, {{are widely used}} in statistical work, mainly as regression splines and smoothing splines. Barycentric rational interpolants have recently been developed by numerical analysts, but have yet seen very few statistical applications. We give the necesssary information to enable the reader to use barycentric rational interpolants, including a suggestion for a Bayesian prior distribution, and explore the possible statistical use of barycentric interpolants as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>splines.</b> We give the all the necessary formulae, compare the numerical accuracy <b>to</b> <b>splines</b> for some Monte-Carlo datasets, and apply both regression splines and barycentric interpolants to two real datasets. We also discuss the application of these interpolants to data smoothing, where smoothing splines would normally be used, and exemplify the use of smoothing interpolants with another real dataset. Our conclusion is that barycentric interpolants are as accurate as splines, and no more difficult to understand and program. They offer a viable alternative methodology...|$|R

To maintain these incidence relations, some spline curves {{may have to be}} transformed (translated, rotated, scaled), or even deformed (i. e., the shape of the curve may change) as a result of modifying other spline curves. A data structure and algorithms are given to implement the propagation of these transformations and deformations.
