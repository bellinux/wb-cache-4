5|$|On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling {{in the case}} of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was {{resident}} in <b>that</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment. All of these measures passed.|$|E

40|$|In an {{environment}} of globalization and rapid technological change, entrepreneurship and innovation have become important objectives of <b>state,</b> regional, <b>and</b> local economic development policy. Entrepreneurial focused economic development strategies target <b>state</b> <b>and</b> regional efforts towards policies –such as cluster development, business incubators, regional trade associations, and developing local entrepreneurs and small businesses. If it is imperative <b>that</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> regions pursue these strategies, researchers must begin to classify the types of programs <b>that</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> localities are using, as well as analyze and document {{the impact of these}} policies on knowledge economy variables. This research proposes to add three new and additional elements to this relatively young research stream. This dissertation will address three distinct components of entrepreneurial development policy effort. Manuscript one clarifies and defines a research agenda on business incubators...|$|R

25|$|Herbert Hoover {{was born}} on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa. He is the only President born in <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> the first born west of the Mississippi River. His father, Jesse Hoover (1849–80), was a {{blacksmith}} and farm implement store owner, of German (Pfautz, Wehmeyer), German-Swiss (Huber, Burkhart), and English ancestry. Jesse Hoover and his father Eli had moved to Iowa from Ohio twenty years previously. Hoover's mother, Hulda Randall Minthorn (1849–84), was born in Norwich, Ontario, Canada, and was of English and Irish ancestry. Both of his parents were Quakers.|$|E
25|$|Each State has a Bar Council {{of its own}} whose {{function}} is to enroll the Barristers willing to practise predominately within the territorial confines of <b>that</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> to perform {{the functions of the}} Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practise in India.

The shareholders sued the railroads to prevent them from complying with the law. They also sued Edward T. Young, the Attorney General of Minnesota, to prevent him from enforcing the law.|$|E
25|$|The NAACP {{began to}} lead {{lawsuits}} targeting disfranchisement and racial segregation early in its history. It {{played a significant}} part in the challenge of Guinn v. United States (1915) to Oklahoma's discriminatory grandfather clause, which effectively disenfranchised most black citizens while exempting many whites from certain voter registration requirements. It persuaded the Supreme Court of the United States to rule in Buchanan v. Warley in 1917 <b>that</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local governments cannot officially segregate African Americans into separate residential districts. The Court's opinion reflected the jurisprudence of property rights and freedom of contract as embodied in the earlier precedent it established in Lochner v. New York.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{constitution}} grants the central government, acting through the President, {{the power to}} issue certain directives {{to the government of}} a state in relation to the use of minority languages for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide primary education in the mother tongue for all linguistic minorities, regardless of whether their language is official in <b>that</b> <b>State,</b> <b>and</b> the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.|$|E
50|$|Nagel {{concludes with}} the {{contention}} {{that it would be}} wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims <b>that</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> events are physical, but those physical <b>states</b> <b>and</b> events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the mind-body problem.|$|R

25|$|The Metropolis–Hastings {{algorithm}} {{is the most}} commonly used Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate Ising model estimations. The algorithm first chooses selection probabilities g(μ, ν), which represent the probability that state ν is selected by the algorithm out of all states, given that one is in state μ. It then uses acceptance probabilities A(μ, ν) so that detailed balance is satisfied. If the new state ν is accepted, then we move to <b>that</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> repeat with selecting a new state and deciding to accept it. If ν is not accepted then we stay in μ. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, which for the Ising model is often when the lattice becomes ferromagnetic, meaning all of the sites point in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|Pyrrhus and his {{campaign}} in Italy was effectively {{the only chance}} for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece {{and to a lesser}} extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the Seleucid Empire was forced to cede most of Asia Minor to Rome's ally Pergamon (Pergamum). Rome inherited <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the destruction of Corinth in 146 BC; Greece would then form {{an integral part of the}} Roman world leading into the Byzantine period.|$|E
25|$|The yatra also {{triggered}} religious {{violence in}} its wake, with riots {{in cities across}} North India. As a result, Advani was arrested {{by the government of}} Bihar as the yatra passed through <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> 150,000 supporters were also arrested by the government of Uttar Pradesh. Tens of thousands of activists nonetheless reached Ayodhya and attempted to storm the mosque, resulting in a pitched battle with security forces which left 20 dead. These events caused further Hindu-Muslim riots to break out across the country, in which hundreds were killed. Muslims were often the victims of these riots, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Following these riots, the BJP withdrew its support to the central government, leading to early parliamentary elections. The BJP made significant gains in these elections, both at the national and the state level, {{on the back of the}} religious polarization that followed the yatra.|$|E

25|$|His {{association}} with the trade union movement led to a lengthy career in government service. In 1921, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover appointed Wolman to the Conference on Unemployment, a federal conference charged with studying unemployment during the Post-World War I recession. His service led to additional work for labor unions. Wolman helped the ACWU negotiate unemployment benefits for its members in the mid-1920s, and {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression he was lecturing union audiences on unemployment in 1930. Governor of New York Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him in October 1930 to a committee to recommend solutions to the unemployment problem facing <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> he was chair of a seven-state commission on unemployment in 1931. He became a strong advocate for federal unemployment insurance, and co-authored a major study of European economies in 1932 which linked dropping standards of living to lack of unemployment benefits.|$|E
25|$|The Gettysburg Campaign {{represented}} the final major offensive by Robert E. Lee in the Civil War. Afterward, all combat {{operations of the}} Army of Northern Virginia were in reaction to Union initiatives. Lee suffered over 27,000 casualties during the campaign, a price {{very difficult for the}} Confederacy to pay. The campaign met only some of its major objectives: it had disrupted Union plans for a summer campaign in Virginia, temporarily protecting the citizens and economy of <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> it had allowed Lee's men to live off the bountiful Maryland and Pennsylvania countryside and plunder vast amounts of food and supplies that they carried back with them and {{that would allow them to}} continue the war. However, the myth of Lee's invincibility had been shattered and not a single Union soldier was removed from the Vicksburg Campaign to react to Lee's invasion of the North. (Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, the day Lee ordered his retreat.) Union campaign casualties were approximately 30,100.|$|E
25|$|The Queen employs various royal {{standards}} to mark her presence, the particular one used {{depending on which}} realm she is in or {{acting on behalf of}} at the time. There are currently unique flags for Australia, Barbados, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand, and two variations for the United Kingdom—one for Scotland and another {{for the rest of the}} country. All are heraldic banners displaying the shield of the sovereign's coat of arms for <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> each, save for those of the UK, are defaced in the centre with the Queen's Personal Flag, a crowned E for Elizabeth surrounded by a garland of roses representing the countries of the Commonwealth. This latter flag on its own is used for realms that do not have a unique personal standard for the monarch, as well as for general use in representing the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. The monarch previously held royal standards for Sierra Leone, Mauritius, Malta, and Trinidad and Tobago, but these banners became obsolete when the countries became republics.|$|E
