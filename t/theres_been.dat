This research aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the platoon impacts on major-street left-turn (MSLT) delay at two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersections. The main idea is using a microscopic simulation tool to simulate different platoon scenarios in opposing through traffic, then applying regression models to capture the impacts of platoons on the delay of MSLT. Two platoon variables were adopted as a simplification of the complex platoon scenarios, making it practical to analyze the platoon effects on MSLT delay. The first two steps were to build simulation models for real-world unsignalized intersections and simulate scenarios with a combination of various factors related to platoons in VISSIM simulation. Calibrations of these simulation models based on field data were performed before simulation started. The next step was to define, derive and calibrate two platoon variables for describing the duration and intensity of platoon arrivals in the opposing through traffic, which effectively simplified the large combination of various factors. At last, the two platoon variables and their relationship with MSLT delay change factor were modeled with regression tools. A relationship between the two variables and the delay change factor was established, which indicated a positive effect by upstream platoons on MSLT delay and made it possible to quantify the impacts. The findings in this research could also be used for future research on left turn treatment regarding platoon or signal impacts...|$|E

She {{is very concerned}} about modern biotechnology, specifically genetic engineering and GM feed crops. She tells Songolo Akakandelwa, why. IN:		?It fundamentally interferes ?? OUT:		??. your own country and the region. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Miriam Mayet was talking to Songolo Akakandelwa. Transcript Mayet	It fundamentally interferes with the way nature reproduces. It is very very different from traditional and conventional biotechnologies. It is a technology owned by multinational corporations. There hasn?t been enough time for adequate safety testing. It has never been tested in humans. It fundamentally impacts on food production systems. It will have far ranging implications on household food security. Aka	Talking about implications, how are these going to impact on these people? Mayet	The first {{thing is that it}} is not a sustainable technology. If you look at Bt cotton for example in South Africa we see that there is pest resistance. Farmers have to spray against the very insects that Bt is supposed to protect the plant against- namely bollworms. And they have two choices. Either they spray their crops or they face wholesale crop failures just to give you one example. When you look at Roundup Ready crops, there?s injudicious use of chemicals. There?s dependence on the same company who supplies the seed ? you have to buy the herbicide that goes with the seed and it has negative environmental implications and the most important thing is that you have weed resistance. So it is not a sustainable technology. It is not an appropriate technology. Aka	Let?s take for instance, the small scale farmers are not scientists in their own right. What is your reaction to such situations? Mayet	I just think farmers are caught in the middle. They don?t have political interests. They have food security and economic interests. They have interests to survive. And they want assistance from governments, from the private sector, from NGOs to enable them to increase household food security. And the tragedy here is that quite apart from consumers being at risk, in terms of the negative impacts on human health, farmers will be the losers. Aka	And how has been your experience in S. Africa? Mayet	There has been very rapid introduction of this technology. We have 350, 000 ha planted with GM crops. 179 applications have been granted for field trials. We have no comprehensive balanced policy over the introduction of modern biotechnology into our food production systems. We have a biotechnology strategy that is biased in favour of the biotechnology industry and we have very bad legislation and no labelling of GM food, no segregation of GM crops from non-GM crops. there?s a lot of contamination ? co-mingling. And we have very little public participation. Aka	So in this case, what fears would you see if there is rapid engagement into such type of technology? Mayet	I think that we are going to see a lot of farmers being impoverished in future, long term. Because if you look at the Makatini Flats <b>there?s</b> <b>been</b> a situation where dependency has been created. The farmers are completely and utterly dependent on Monsanto to help them obtain credit, to help them purchase the seed, to help them access the market and it?s not a sustainable way of uplifting farmers. Aka	What lessons do you give to the other member states in the region to ensure such problems are not faced in the other countries? Mayet	The first thing is don?t follow South Africa?s example. They have done very bad laws. Do first, a good policy. The policy should underpin your legislation. You can?t have legislation in isolation or in a vacuum. South Africa did it the other way round. They did the law first and only now the policy is coming. So first do a good comprehensive fair policy taking into account the long term interests of your own country and the region.

40|$|A presente pesquisa analisou materiais e propostas didáticas sobre o tema da astronomia {{cultural}}, tendo em vista sua inserção no ensino de tópicos de Física e Ciências na educação básica. A astronomia cultural pode ser tomada como o estudo das relações entre os saberes produzidos sobre o céu e as dinâmicas socioculturais de um dado grupo. A existência de uma grande multiplicidade de culturas indica a possibilidade de inúmeras formas de se relacionar com os elementos celestes. Tal diversidade pouco ou raramente é explorada, sendo um dos objetos desta pesquisa evidenciar que as discussões desta temática podem ser potencialmente interessantes para trabalhar em sala de aula a questão do respeito à diversidade cultural, apresentando aos estudantes outras lógicas de pensamento, distintas das referências da cultura ocidental. Foram realizadas revisões bibliográficas a fim de construir um panorama da produção dos pesquisadores da área de ensino de ciências junto aos temas do multiculturalismo e da astronomia cultural. Este procedimento favoreceu o contato com materiais e propostas didáticas que foram selecionadas para comporem o conjunto de dados a ser trabalhado. Com base na metodologia da análise de conteúdo, doze documentos que abordaram a astronomia cultural de maneira articulada ao contexto da sala de aula foram analisados, investigando-se três dimensões de análise. Os questionamentos realizados se relacionam aos seguintes aspectos: principais temas abordados pelos materiais; tipos de perspectivas voltadas ao multiculturalismo e à noção de cultura; o papel de medidas legislativas, a exemplo da Lei Federal nº 11. 645 / 08, no aumento da produção de materiais abordando a astronomia cultural. Dentre os resultados da análise, verificou-se que os temas com maior frequência estão relacionados a narrativas sobre o funcionamento do universo e aos asterismos (ou constelações) de algumas etnias indígenas, sendo pouco recorrente o trabalho aprofundado com variadas estruturas de pensamento ou outras visões de mundo distintas da cultura ocidental. Sobre a abordagem ao multiculturalismo, houve uma polarização entre um viés diferencialista, que valoriza as diferenças particulares dos grupos, e uma postura intercultural, com ênfase no diálogo. Almeja-se que o trabalho possa contribuir para evidenciar algumas das potencialidades do ensino de astronomia cultural na educação básica, ao inserir discussões voltadas a diversidade cultural a fim de formar indivíduos que estejam menos centrados nas práticas de seu próprio grupo e mais abertos ao intercâmbio entre culturas e saberes distintos. The {{present research}} examined materials and didactic proposals {{on the topic}} of cultural astronomy, with a view to their inclusion in the teaching of physics and science topics in basic education. Cultural astronomy can be taken as the study of the relationship between knowledge produced about sky and socio-cultural dynamics of a given group. The existence of a great variety of cultures indicates the possibility of numerous ways to relate to the elements of the sky. Such little diversity or is rarely explored, being one of the objects of this research show that discussions of this theme can be potentially interesting to work in the classroom the issue of respect for cultural diversity, showing other students thought logic, other than the reference of Western culture. Bibliographical reviews were carried out in order to build a panorama of the production of the researchers of science teaching with the themes of multiculturalism and cultural astronomy. This procedure favored contact with didactic materials and proposals that have been selected to compose the set of data to be worked. Based on content analysis methodology, twelve documents that addressed cultural Astronomy of articulated way to the context of the classroom were analyzed investigating three dimensions of analysis. The questions made relate to the following aspects: main themes addressed by the materials; types of prospects aimed at multiculturalism and the concept of culture; the role of legislative measures, such as the Federal Law no. 11, 645, increasing production of materials addressing the cultural astronomy. One {{of the results of the}} analysis, it was found that the subjects most often are related to narratives about the workings of the universe and the asterisms (or constellations) of some indigenous ethnic groups, being little in-depth work with recurrent varied structures of thoughts or other worldviews. On the approach to multiculturalism, <b>thereś</b> <b>been</b> a polarization between a differentialist bias, that values the differences of private groups, and an intercultural attitude. Aims that the work will help to highlight some of the potential of cultural astronomy education in basic education, to enter discussions to cultural diversity in order to train individuals who are less focused on the practices of their own group and more open to the exchange between cultures and knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Cue: In {{the last}} fifty years, {{agricultural}} development in Africa has mostly been built on non-native crops; the leading example is probably maize, which originally came from Latin America. However, the development of new, higher yielding varieties of non-native crops has often come with a price, many of them requiring expensive inputs of chemical fertilizer as well as careful and time-consuming management {{in order to be}} productive. When a farming family is afflicted by disease, both its financial resources and its capacity to work are put under pressure. As a result, crop yields tend to suffer, leading to a downward spiral of poor nutrition and worsening health. Is there a way for farming communities to break out of this negative cycle? One approach being advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture in Malawi is the growing of indigenous African crops. These often have the double advantage of being relatively easy to grow, and also being very nutritious, as Excello Zidana found out when he spoke to Ben Chingwalu, an agricultural officer from Malawi?s Mwanza district. IN:		?We are encouraging the farmers ?? OUT:		??prepare them for their meals. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 07 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ben Chingwalu on the important links between agriculture and nutrition. Transcript Chingwalu	We are encouraging the farmers to grow a variety of crops and to keep a variety of animals so that their nutrition is improved so that they are able to keep themselves healthy, so that they are able to work hard in their fields. Zidana	Can you mention some of the foods which are connected with nutrition status? Chingwalu	We have got a variety of foods which are very nutritious. Here in Mwanza we are encouraging use of indigenous as well as exotic vegetables. Indigenous vegetables are those which are naturally growing in the area and these are proved to be very nutritious because they are very green and {{they have a lot of}} vitamins, particularly vitamin C. We are also promoting the growing of traditional legumes like pigeon peas, groundnuts, beans and Soya beans. As you know Mwanza is renowned for fruits, particularly the tangerines. So we are promoting the growing of tangerines so that farmers can also utilise them. We are also promoting the growing of roots and tubers. We are talking about cassava, sweet potato, white potato which some people call Irish potato. All these things combined improve the nutrition of the foods so that when they utilise these properly the people are able to get the nutritional requirements in their bodies. Zidana	I remember previously you people have not been telling farmers to grow crops like what you have mentioned here. But now having gone into this programme have you noticed any impact so far? Chingwalu	Yes <b>there?s</b> <b>been</b> a lot of impact because first of all the crops which were not emphasised previously are easy to grow, they don?t need a lot of inputs. These were ignored previously in our messages but now we are emphasising them and we have seen that they are nutritious and you see helping the farmers to improve their nutrition. We are emphasising on improving their traditional methods of growing these crops. So it?s really helping, it?s making an impact. Zidana	What are some of the examples of the diseases which are associated with the lack of nutritious food? Chingwalu	A wide variety of diseases, we are talking about kwashiorkor and marasmus, and I can say in general all diseases. When a person is not well fed, when a person is weak, he?s prone to attack by another disease and you know the impact of HIV/AIDS is going to be paramount because the people are very weak, so that any disease is going to attack them. So it?s cheaper for the government if people are well fed, they are able to prevent the diseases instead of going to the hospital. So we are going to save our hospital bills when the farmers improve their diets. Zidana	Do you normally do some activities together with those from the Ministry of Health? Chingwalu	Yes indeed, we work together with the Ministry of Health. For example; our members of staff in the field go to the under five clinics where they work together with the Ministry of Health officials to teach farmers on the production of nutritious foods that can be prepared locally here. So we are working together with the Ministry of Health as well as other Ministries so that we link together in terms of production so that our farmers can produce good quality foodstuffs and prepare them for their meals.

40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But you also have to look at what is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there isn?t that water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless you?ve got a government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I think it depends on whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can you explain what you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously that?s going to be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because <b>there?s</b> <b>been</b> interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.
