40|$|AbstractThe article aims {{to point}} out the mutual {{relations}} between underground mining and its manifestations on the ground surface. For the purpose, churches in the Karviná Region were selected. <b>The</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> been affected by over 200 -year long extraction of hard coal. Some of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> been influenced {{from the start of the}} mining activities, others later on. Thanks to the combined effects of the historical significance of the monuments and their diversion from the vertical axis, <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> become even more interesting. Moreover, they clearly document how the anthropogenic mining activities influence the built-up area. Some of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>have</b> been preserved to date, some had to be demolished, unfortunately. Nowadays, the monuments are becoming significant sites of geotourism interest...|$|R
