The wire loop appears much finer than a natural fibre, and the question should be asked if it contributed to severing the hook tips.|$|R

40|$|After skin grafting, {{to prevent}} hematoma or seroma {{collection}} at the graft site, a tie-over dressing has been commonly used. However, although the conventional tie-over dressing by suture is a useful method for securing a graft site, refixation is difficult when repeated tieover dressing is needed. Therefore, we recommend a redoable tie-over dressing technique with multiple loops <b>threads</b> and connecting <b>silk</b> <b>threads.</b> After the raw surface of each of our cases {{was covered with a}} skin graft, multiple loop <b>silk</b> <b>thread</b> attached with nylon at the skin graft margin. We applied the ointment gauze and wet cotton/fluffy gauze over the skin graft, then fixed the dressing by connecting cross-counter multiple loop <b>thread</b> with connecting <b>silk</b> <b>threads.</b> When we opened the tie-over dressing by cutting the connecting <b>silk</b> <b>threads,</b> we repeated the tie-over dressing with the same method. The skin graft was taken successfully without hematoma or seroma collection or any other complications. In conclusion, we report a novel tie-over dressing enabling simple fixation of the dressing to maintain proper tension for wounds that require repetitive fixation. Further, with this reliable method, the skin grafts were well taken...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Broken <b>silk</b> <b>thread</b> {{is one of}} the {{numerous}} fancy yarns, and has been used in development of yarn-dyed textiles. However, the processing technology of traditional broken <b>silk</b> <b>thread</b> is very complex, and has restricted its wide application in the development of new textile products. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a novel spinning technology of broken silk fancy yarn. Some examples of broken <b>silk</b> <b>thread,</b> which spun <b>silk</b> or cotton yarn is used as core yarn and binding yarn, polyester filament is as used as effect yarn, are spun on the ring fancy yarn twisting machine, and physical properties of these fancy yarns are tested and analyzed. The better technical program about choice of fiber material on the fancy component yarn and technological processes is put forward, and some tips on the operation are also given...|$|R

40|$|Silk {{patterns}} are {{works of art}} that resembles the valuable and unique ethnic culture that is most important to the community. The history and development of silk patterns {{in the province of}} Khon Kaen can be divided into 2 periods, before and after the year 1976. During these periods there were many changes in the manufacturing of silk textiles. The origin of classical silk patterns came from direct modeling of plants, animals and nature. Contemporary silk {{patterns are}} modeled after mediums such as television, multimedia, publications and from client requests. The manufacturing tools have also been greatly improved from wooden tools to tools made from metals and tools reinforce with steel. Electric motors have also been utilized in increasing the efficiency in the transformation of silk such as in process of dyeing and spooling <b>silk</b> <b>threads.</b> Traditional materials in silk textile production utilized traditional home grown and produced <b>silk</b> <b>threads</b> while in modern times, the silk comes from factories and purchased in spools. Locally produced <b>silk</b> <b>threads</b> are still produced but in lesser quantity because natural pigments and threads are limited in color.

40|$|Individuals of {{the social}} spider mite Stigmaeopsis longus live communally in narrow, humid nests made from <b>silk</b> <b>threads</b> and display nest {{sanitation}} behaviour through the coordinated deposition of faeces. We used artificial dust to experimentally determine that females of this species use <b>silk</b> <b>threads</b> to perform regular cleaning of the nest space and eggs. We first learned that silk-weaving behaviour is not a by-product of nest building (nest reinforcement); rather, it is actively performed {{as a function of}} cleaning the living space and eggs. Furthermore, we determined the effectiveness of the attending females by artificially manipulating their natural habitat, which is clearly connected to the cleaning behaviour by parental females. As such, we have uncovered an extraordinary new role of <b>silk</b> <b>threads</b> as devices for cleaning the nest space and/or eggs. These results strongly indicate that special adaptations for maintaining clean habitats are essential for animals to evolve aggregative social lives...|$|R
