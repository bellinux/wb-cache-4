5|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed {{control of}} <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> program in June 1942, and Compton's Metallurgical Laboratory {{became part of}} {{what came to be}} called the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited the Metallurgical Laboratory {{for the first time on}} 5 October. Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.|$|E
5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Ramsey was {{approached}} by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but {{the intervention of the}} Project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> being built by the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it.

Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas.

5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D.

The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC.

25|$|As the {{civilian}} nuclear program pursued energy, {{the problem of}} getting access to plutonium, for both research and subsequent production of nuclear weapons, loomed as the biggest technical problem for <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> program. For many research purposes, such as metallurgy, plutonium containing more than 7% Pu-240 could be used, although this isotopic mixture {{could not be used}} as weapons-grade plutonium. Plutonium of this composition could be obtained relatively easily from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from civilian reactors. However, to do so would require explicit violation of the agreed upon safeguards. A prerequisite for such activities would be conducting the nuclear reprocessing solely in Sweden, although the capacity to do so did not exist when reactor R3 was put into operation. Thus, Reactor R3 was less useful to <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> program than it was originally intended.|$|E
