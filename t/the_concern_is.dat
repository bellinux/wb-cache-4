25|$|Americans are not {{generally}} {{aware of the}} extent of inequality or recent trends. There is a direct relationship between actual income inequality and the public's views about the need to address the issue in most developed countries, but not in the U.S., where income inequality is worse but <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> lower. The U.S. was ranked the 6th worst among 173 countries (4th percentile) on income equality measured by the Gini index.|$|E

25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is suboptimal. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> that imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E
25|$|A draft risk {{assessment}} released by Health Canada in July 2016 {{has found that}} overexposure to boric acid {{has the potential to}} cause developmental and reproductive health effects. Since people are already exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> not with any one product, but rather multiple exposures from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that registrations for certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in homes, will have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).|$|E

Hinckley's background in journalism and public relations prepared him well to preside over the church during a time when it has received increasing media coverage.|$|R

25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, a major nuclear {{equipment}} supplier, Holtec International, criticized the Department of Energy's safety plan for handling containers of radioactive waste {{before they are}} buried at the proposed Yucca Mountain dump. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> that, in an earthquake, the unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial at Yucca Mountain could be sent into a [...] "chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts".|$|E

2500|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Tillich {{believes}} {{the essence of}} religious attitudes is what he calls [...] "ultimate concern". [...] Separate from all profane and ordinary realities, the object of <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> understood as sacred, numinous or holy. The perception of its reality is felt as so overwhelming and valuable that all else seems insignificant, {{and for this reason}} requires total surrender. [...] In 1957, Tillich defined his conception of faith more explicitly in his work, Dynamics of Faith.|$|E
2500|$|The American Civil Liberties Union {{directly}} {{participated in}} this case {{on the side of}} Joseph Frederick. The Center for Individual Rights, National Coalition Against Censorship, and other groups that advocate First Amendment protection filed amici curiae in support of Frederick. Students for Sensible Drug Policy also noted that banning drug-related speech would undermine their ability to have chapters in public schools. The American Center for Law and Justice, and Rutherford Institute, and several other Christian right groups also filed briefs on the side of Frederick, reasoning that if schools could ban [...] "offensive" [...] speech they would also be able to prohibit religious speech with which administrators disagree. On this point, the Christian right groups prevailed, as the Supreme Court explicitly declined to hold that school boards could discipline [...] "offensive" [...] speech, noting that [...] "much political and religious speech might be perceived as offensive to some" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> [...] "not that Frederick's speech was offensive, but that it was reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use".|$|E
2500|$|Researchers believe one in 2,000 {{people in}} the UK is a carrier of the disease linked to eating {{contaminated}} beef (vCJD). The survey provides the most robust prevalence measure to date—and identifies abnormal prion protein across a wider age group than found previously and in all genotypes, indicating [...] "infection" [...] may be relatively common. This new study examined over 32,000 anonymous appendix samples. Of these, 16 samples were positive for abnormal prion protein, indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population, or one in 2,000 {{people are likely to}} be carriers. No difference was seen in different birth cohorts (1941–60 and 1961–85), in both sexes, and there was no apparent difference in abnormal prion prevalence in three broad geographical areas. Genetic testing of the 16 positive samples revealed a higher proportion of valine homozygous (VV) genotype on the codon 129 of the gene encoding the prion protein (PRNP) compared with the general UK population. This also differs from the 177 patients with vCJD, all of whom to date have been methionine homozygous (MM) genotype. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> that individuals with this VV genotype may be susceptible to developing the condition over longer incubation periods.|$|E
