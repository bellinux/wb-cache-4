60|$|It is our {{intention}} to use this parallel {{in the discussion of}} the Homeric house. All Icelandic chiefs' houses in the tenth and eleventh centuries were not precisely uniform in structure and accommodation, and saga writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, living more comfortably than their forefathers, sometimes confuse matters by introducing the arrangements of their own into the tale of past times. But, in any case, one Icelandic house of the tenth or eleventh century might differ from another in certain details. It is not safe, therefore, to argue that difference of detail in Homer's accounts of various houses means that <b>the</b> varying <b>descriptions</b> <b>were</b> <b>composed</b> in different ages. In the Odyssey the plot demands that the poet must enter into domestic details much more freely than he ever has occasion to do in the Iliad. He may mention upper chambers freely, for example; it will not follow that in the Iliad upper chambers do not exist because they are only mentioned twice in that Epic.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{integrates}} {{logical and}} probabilistic {{approaches to the}} representation of planning problems by developing a first-order logic of time, chance, and action. We start by making explicit and precise commonsense notions about time, chance, and action central to the planning problem. We then develop a logic, the semantics of which incorporates these intuitive properties. The logical language integrates both modal and probabilistic constructs and allows quantification over time points, probability values, and domain individuals. Probability is treated as a sentential operator in the language, {{so it can be}} arbitrarily nested and combined with other logical operators. The language can represent the chance that facts hold and events occur at various times. It can represent the chance that actions and other events affect the future. The model of action distinguishes between action feasibility, executability, and effects. We present a proof theory for the logic and show how the logic can be used to describe actions {{in such a way that}} <b>the</b> action <b>descriptions</b> can <b>be</b> <b>composed</b> to infer properties of plans via the proof theory...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for shape description and invariant recognition by geometric-normalization implemented by neural networks. The neural system consists of a shape description network, a normalization network and a recognition stage based on fuzzy pyramidal neural networks. <b>The</b> <b>description</b> network uses a novel approach for hierar-chical shape segmentation and representation which expands the image shapes into localized feature tokens. These feature tokens form a compact <b>description</b> of <b>the</b> shape and its com-ponents that include information on their location, size and orientation. <b>The</b> <b>description</b> network, which <b>is</b> <b>composed</b> of a novel pyramidal architecture called the Vectorial Gradual Lattice Pyramid, processes in parallel a new vectorial scale space representation of the shape. A novel measure called Cancellation Energy is {{used to determine the}} feature tokens. The normalization network utilizes the location, size, and orientation information in the feature tokens to geometric-normalize the shape or its components with respect to these parame-ters. The recognition network which has a pyramidal structure, uses a fuzzy representation of these normalized feature tokens to achieve robust invariant recognition. Experimental results demonstrate robust recognition in large variations of scale, rotation, translation an...|$|R

As a matter of courtesy they consented, and plates were placed before them, heaped with a stew consisting of meat, vegetables, and hot peppers. While the meal went on the king asked Mr. Goodenough what he had come to the coast for, and {{was disappointed}} to find {{that he was not going}} to set up as a trader at Bonny, as it was the custom for each newcomer to make a handsome present to him.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis Position of war {{refugees}} {{in international law}} is to analyze particular types of protection of war refugees, to construe unclear legal provisions and to evaluate suitability of possible solutions. The thesis focuses on specifics {{of the position of}} war refugees and on options of their protection. The research question relates to the determination who a war refugee is and how his situation is solved in international law. The reason for this research is my great interest in refugee law and the current instability of the position of war refugees. The methodology used during writing the thesis was the analysis, comparison and <b>description.</b> <b>The</b> thesis <b>is</b> <b>composed</b> of three chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of the position and the protection of war refugees. Chapter One defines characteristics of war refugees and addresses the issue of armed conflicts. Chapter Two concerns individual options of protection of war refugees in international law. This part concentrates primarily on issues related to the broader refugee definition, asylum and subsidiary protection. Within this chapter subsidiary protection is examined from a general point of view, as well as in relation to provisions of particular legal instruments.

40|$|Ventricular {{cells are}} {{immersed}} in a bath of electrolytes and these ions are essential for a healthy heart and a regular rhythm. Maintaining physiological concentration of them is fundamental for reducing arrhythmias and risk of sudden cardiac death, especially in haemodialysis patients and in the heart diseases treatments. Models of electrically activity of the heart based on mathematical formulation {{are a part of}} the efforts to improve the understanding and prediction of heart behaviour. Modern models incorporate the extensive and ever increasing amounts of experimental data in incorporating biophysically detailed mechanisms to allow the detailed study of molecular and subcellular mechanisms of heart disease. The goal of this project was to simulate the effects of changes in potassium and calcium concentrations in the extracellular space between experimental data and and a description incorpored into two modern biophysically detailed models (Grandi et al. Model; O’Hara Rudy Model). Moreover the task was to analyze the changes in the ventricular electrical activity, in particular by studying the modifications on the simulated electrocardiographic signal. We used the cellular information obtained by the heart models in order to build a 1 D tissue <b>description.</b> <b>The</b> fibre <b>is</b> <b>composed</b> by 165 cells, it is divided in four groups to differentiate the cell types that compound human ventricular tissue. The main results are the following: Grandi et al. (GBP) model is not even able to reproduce the correct action potential profile in hyperkalemia. Data from hospitalized patients indicates that the action potential duration (APD) should be shorter than physiological state but in this model we have the opposite. From the potassium point of view the results obtained by using O’Hara model (ORD) are in agreement with experimental data for the single cell action potential in hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, most of the currents follow the data from literature. In the 1 D simulations we were able to reproduce ECGs signal in most the potassium concentrations we selected for this study and we collected data that can help physician in understanding what happens in ventricular cells during electrolyte disorder. However the model fails in the conduction of the stimulus under hyperkalemic conditions. The model emphasized the ECG modifications when the K+ is slightly more than physiological value. In the calcium setting using the ORD model we found an APD shortening in hypocalcaemia and an APD lengthening in hypercalcaemia, i. e. the opposite to experimental observation. This wrong behaviour is kept in one dimensional simulations bringing a longer QT interval in the ECG under higher [Ca 2 +]o conditions and vice versa. In conclusion it has highlighted that the actual ventricular models present in literature, even if they are useful in the original form, they need an improvement in the sensitivity of these two important electrolytes. We suggest an use of the GBP model with modifications introduced by Carro et al. who understood that the failure of this model is related to the Shannon et al. model (a rabbit model) from which the GBP model was built. The ORD model should be modified in the Ca 2 + - dependent IcaL and in the influence of the Iks in the action potential for letting it him produce a correct action potential under different calcium concentrations. In the 1 D tissue maybe a heterogeneity setting of intra and extracellular conductances for the different cell types should improve a reproduction of the ECG signal...|$|R
