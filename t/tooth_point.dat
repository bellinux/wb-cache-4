40|$|Purpose: Errors in orthognathic model surgery {{occur during}} the planning, {{measuring}} and/or moving of the models. However, {{there has been}} little effort to find ways to reduce these errors. In this study, we introduce a new orthognathic model surgery technique (Yonsei method) which adopts the <b>tooth</b> <b>point</b> as the reference and the occlusal index as a moving vehicle for the model. Methods: The technique consists mainly of: 1) measuring the three-dimensional lengths of model points, 2) fabricating and moving the occlusal index and 3) verifying the movement. Then we compared the accuracy of the Yonsei method to conventional methods, with special reference made to influencing factors. Results: Errors for the Yonsei method with the occlusal index were reduced to the range of 0. 61 ∼ 1. 04 mm in three-dimension, providing a more accurate model surgery technique than conventional methods which have errors ranging from 0. 77 ∼ 3. 1...|$|E
40|$|Currently, hybrid {{and fully}} {{electric}} vehicles {{are being developed}} in a great variety regarding topology, power and range. This requires a new methodology for NVH (Noise Vibration and Harshness) evaluation of potential problems early in the design phase. This methodology requires reliable simulation approaches for hybrid and electric drivetrains, concerning the whole automobile, and {{not limited to the}} electric machine. One of the main NVH sources is the electric drive, as the excitations in the electric motor, caused by the electromagnetic forces, excite its housing and that of the drivetrain, causing a structure-borne vibration. Torque ripple generates excitations in the shaft and gearbox, which are then transmitted to the whole drivetrain housing. It is seen that a low-torque-ripple design aim might not be enough for reducing the NVH issues, and specially radiated noise, in a fully electric or hybrid drivetrain, since Maxwell forces experienced by the stator can be present in frequencies where there is no torque harmonic. Since analytic models cannot represent accurately the non-linearity of the magnetic field and the detailed design of the stator and rotor geometries, the FEM (Finite Element Method) simulations are unavoidable to study the electrical motors in detail. A FEM tool is used in this project to design and assess the performance of an induction machine, focusing on the effect that driving profile and control unit cause on the electric drive, magnetic field and forces in the system for different driving conditions. The produced forces are evaluated to assess the noise and vibration in the system. It is seen that FEM results correlate with what theory predicts, as force harmonic orders are 0, 2 and n ± 1, where n is any magnetic flux density harmonic. The center <b>tooth</b> <b>point</b> only experiences radial forces, whereas the corner points have tangential stress as well, due to saturation. An example of 15 μm dynamic eccentricity illustrates alterations force and torque harmonic magnitudes due to shaft assembly eccentricity or shaft bending caused by bearing clearance and/or stiffer gear contact vibration...|$|E

50|$|The most {{familiar}} kinds of bevel gears have pitch angles {{of less than}} 90 degrees and therefore are cone-shaped. This type of bevel gear is called external because the gear <b>teeth</b> <b>point</b> outward.

50|$|The {{coping saw}} blade is {{installed}} with the <b>teeth</b> <b>pointing</b> towards the handle. Unlike a hacksaw, {{which has the}} <b>teeth</b> <b>pointed</b> away from the handle, the coping saw cuts on the pull stroke. The coping saw blade is removable by partially unscrewing the handle. The blade is prevented from rotating {{by means of the}} short, steady bar provided where the blade is attached. Loosening the handle also allows the blade to be rotated relative to the frame as desired. Carefully aligning the finger with the steady bars at {{the top and bottom of}} the blade ensures that the thin blade is straight and not twisted along its length. Retightening the handle tensions the blade and locks it at the desired angle relative to the frame. The short steady bar nearest the handle is held securely between finger and thumb while the handle is tightened to ensure the blade remains at the desired angle. Unlike the fretsaw the coping saw blade has holding pins which lock securely into the angled slots of the rotatable blade holders.|$|R

Ahead of the tooth was a depth gauge, which allowed for good clearance around the tooth for chip clearing while limiting the depth of cut and preventing grabbing or overloading. Chipper chains are sometimes used for dirty work, since their very large working corner allows the cutter to retain its effective sharpness for a long time in abrasive conditions.|$|R

Face gears allow a variety of new transmission arrangements as well as high reduction ratio capability. This leads to drive system weight reduction and improvements in performance.

Tooth geometry, kinematics, generation of face gears with localized bearing contact by cutting and grinding, avoidance of tooth undercutting, avoidance of <b>tooth</b> <b>pointing,</b> <b>tooth</b> contact analysis, and algorithms for the simulation of meshing and contact arc all topics which are discussed. In addition, applications of face gear drives are presented.

50|$|The {{cephalothorax}} {{is almost}} entirely covered by a carapace, only the insertion of the eyestalks protruding slightly beyond it. A deep transverse groove, called the cervical groove, divides the anterior 40% of the carapace from the posterior 60%. At the front, the carapace bears a fairly long rostrum, which is wide at the base, giving it a triangular outline when seen from above. From the side, it is curved in a weak S-shape, bending initially upwards, and then curving slightly forwards again. The cephalothorax becomes slightly wider behind the cervical groove. The carapace, including the rostrum, is covered with forward-pointing <b>teeth</b> (<b>pointed</b> tubercles), including two rows side-by-side along the animal's midline; these rows bridge the cervical groove, but become weaker in the posterior half of the carapace. Beneath the carapace is a branchial chamber, containing 28 pairs of gills.|$|R
