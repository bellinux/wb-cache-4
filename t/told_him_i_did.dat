60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} his mate Bill, {{and this was}} for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain.|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not use to court, but I durst venture {{myself to}} the East Indies with him, {{if there was a}} {{necessity}} of his going.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not come}} in to fool," [...] he said, stoutly. [...] "Your man outside insisted that I should come in and try on the things, {{although}} I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish to buy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>do</b> {{anything}} in the matter. And I couldn't--then. But you'll remember to put in that foot-and-mouth paragraph. I want something to work upon.' ...|$|R
60|$|On the morrow of his {{departure}} came further {{accounts of the}} doings of the Spaniards that plunged Montezuma into still greater alarm. In his terror he sent for an astronomer, noted throughout the land for the truth of his divinations. The astronomer came, and was received by the emperor privately. What he <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, {{but at least it}} was nothing pleasant, for that very night men were commanded to pull down the house of this sage, who was buried in its ruins.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not go in}} for trade. I even added grimly that I {{knew only}} too well how that sort of spec. {{generally}} ended.|$|R
60|$|He told me I {{did not do}} myself justice. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and it {{was because}} I did and meant to do so to the last, that I would not stoop to propitiate any of them. He was {{concerned}} and even shocked, when I added that I wished he would not parade his attachment before them; {{but he said he}} would sacrifice even the honest impulses of his affection to my peace.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> And then I said I {{would run}} below for a minute, to ram {{a few of}} my things into a sailor's bag I had. I've never cared for a lot of dunnage; I {{believed}} in going about flying light when I was at sea. I came back and found him strolling up and down the deck, as if he were taking {{a breath of fresh air}} before turning in, like any other evening.|$|E
6000|$|I {{came home}} across America from San Francisco to New York, visiting Utah and Brigham Young on the way. I did not achieve great {{intimacy}} {{with the great}} polygamist of the Salt Lake City. I called upon him, sending to him my card, apologising for doing so without an introduction, and excusing myself by saying that I {{did not like to}} pass through the territory without seeing a man of whom I had heard so much. He received me in his doorway, not asking me to enter, and inquired whether I were not a miner. When I told him that I was not a miner, he asked me whether I earned my bread. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> [...] "I guess you're a miner," [...] said he. I again assured him that I was not. [...] "Then how do you earn your bread?" [...] I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so by writing books. [...] "I'm sure you're a miner," [...] said he. Then he turned upon his heel, went back into the house, and closed the door. I was properly punished, as I was vain enough to conceive that he would have heard my name.|$|E
60|$|If it will ease your suspense, let me {{tell you}} that <b>I</b> have not <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> protest to you that you must treat me with more--more kindness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, as I {{had never}} seen the Fung idol, but I {{understood}} that its size was enormous, probably as large as St. Paul's Cathedral.|$|R
5000|$|Harrison {{stayed at}} Boreham Wood {{ahead of the}} 2007-08 season. In September 2007, having failed to find the net once, he was demoted to the substitute's bench for Boreham Wood's game against Harlow Town. On Harrison's omission, manager Steve Cook said [...] "Byron {{has been a little}} subdued of late, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not expect <b>him</b> {{to be out of the}} team for long". Despite making several starting appearances, Harrison failed to find the net once during the first two months of the 2007-08 season. He was released by Boreham Wood on 30 October 2007.|$|R
6000|$|I {{laughed at}} him, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know what}} I might come to hereafter, but as our case was now, I should make no scruple {{to take the first}} ship I came at to get our liberty; I only wished we could see one, and come at her. Just while we were talking, one of our men that was at the door of our hut, told us that the carpenter, who it seems was upon a hill at a distance, cried out, [...] "A sail! a sail!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} the {{smallness}} of our crew, and the course we were steering, struck these pilots, the moment they had time to ascertain the first fact. It was not usual, in that day, nor do I suppose it is now, for deep-laden Americans to pass so near England, coming from the south-east and steering to the north-west. A remark to this effect fell {{from the mouth of}} the principal pilot, as soon as I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish to go in to any of the neighbouring ports.|$|E
60|$|And now he made deep protestations of {{a sincere}} {{inviolable}} affection for me, but all along attested {{it to be}} with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own. I told him I was fully satisfied of it. He carried it that length that he protested to me, that if he was naked in bed with me, he would as sacredly preserve my virtue as he would defend it if I was assaulted by a ravisher. I believed him, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so; but this did not satisfy him, he would, he said, wait for some opportunity to give me an undoubted testimony of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] {{answered}} the Count. [...] "I let my hands hang down very still. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> quietly <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not intend making a noise. He snarled like a dog, then {{said in an}} ordinary voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would <b>do</b> so, {{with all}} the {{interest}} and curiosity that his preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, {{he asked me if}} I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers [...] "at it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will make}} no matter though he should live for ever. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean to}} <b>do</b> it because <b>I</b> thought {{that he would be}} weak; but he has been strong enough for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was the day}} of the riots," [...] she continued; [...] "he {{would go}} out, and I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think that the streets would be safe for a {{foreigner}} like him: for he always wore such very fine clothes, and I made sure that the starving men and women of Paris would strip them off his back when their tempers were roused. But he only laughed. He gave me a bit of paper and told me that if he did not return I might conclude that he had been killed, and if the Committee of Public Safety asked me questions about me, I was just to show the bit of paper {{and there would be no}} further trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you do, do you! Sure! I {{talk all}} the time! And I'm just a {{business}} man--oh sure!--I'm no Ph.D. like Littlefield, and no poet, and I haven't anything to spring! Well, {{let me tell}} you, {{just the other day}} your darn Chum Frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what I thought about the Springfield school-bond issue. And who <b>told</b> <b>him?</b> <b>I</b> <b>did!</b> You bet your life I told him! Little me! I certainly did! He came up and asked me, and I told him all about it! You bet! And he was darn glad to listen to me and--Duty as a host! I guess I know my duty as a host and let me tell you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Will it bore you, my dear Dick, if I {{tell you}} {{of an old}} Indian's death? It seems a pretty and {{touching}} story. Old Pe-shau-ba {{was a friend of}} Tanner. One day he fell violently ill. He sent for Tanner and said to him: [...] "I remember before I came to live in this world, I was with the Great Spirit above. I saw many good and desirable things, and among others a beautiful woman. And the Great Spirit said: 'Pe-shau-ba, do you love the woman?' I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Then he said, 'Go down and spend a few winters on earth. You cannot stay long, and you must remember to be always kind and good to my children whom you see below.' So I came down, but I have never forgotten what was said to me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} for certain as I had never taken any {{interest}} in India, being an African elephant-hunter and trader, but <b>I</b> thought they <b>did</b> occasionally. Just then Robinson passed by and called to me-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I used no force till {{a man had}} me by {{the collar}} to push me back; and I wasn't violent, not then. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was <b>doing</b> what <b>I</b> {{had a right to}} do,--and it was that as made him hang on to me." ...|$|R
60|$|He asked me, {{first of}} all, whether I conferred a charm and a {{distinction}} on London by residing in it? <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not think it}} necessary to reply that I was perfectly aware <b>I</b> should not <b>do</b> that, in any case, but merely <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>I</b> <b>did</b> reside.|$|R
60|$|He, after {{learning}} that I had lived at Springfield, asked if I was acquainted with you. I told him I was. He said you had lately been elected constable in Adams, but that you never would be again. I asked him why. He said the people there had found out that you had been sheriff or deputy sheriff in Sangamon County, and that you came off and left your securities to suffer. He then asked me if I did not know such to be the fact. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think you had ever been sheriff or deputy sheriff in Sangamon, but that I thought you had been constable. I further told him {{that if you had}} left your securities to suffer in that or any other case, I had never heard of it, and that if it had been so, I thought I would have heard of it.|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} freedom one day, {{after we had}} talked pretty close to the subject, {{to tell him that}} it was true I had {{received}} the compliment of a lover from him, namely, that he would take me without inquiring into my fortune, and I would make him a suitable return in this, viz. that I would make as little inquiry into his as consisted with reason, but I hoped he would allow me to ask a few questions, which he would answer or not as he thought fit; and that I would not be offended if he did not answer me at all; one of these questions related to our manner of living, and the place where, because I had heard he had a great plantation in Virginia, and that he had talked of going to live there, and I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not care to be transported.|$|E
6000|$|No sooner was {{the play}} over, and well over, than the choleric and {{arbitrary}} M. Paul underwent a metamorphosis. His hour of managerial responsibility past, he at once laid aside his magisterial austerity; {{in a moment}} he stood amongst us, vivacious, kind, and social, shook hands with us all round, thanked us separately, and announced his determination {{that each of us}} should in turn be his partner in the coming ball. On his claiming my promise, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not dance. [...] "For once I must," [...] was the answer; and if I had not slipped aside and kept out of his way, he would have compelled me to this second performance. But I had acted enough for one evening; it was time I retired into myself and my ordinary life. My dun-coloured dress did well enough under a paletôt on the stage, but would not suit a waltz or a quadrille. Withdrawing to a quiet nook, whence unobserved I could observe--the ball, its splendours and its pleasures, passed before me as a spectacle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear not. His {{family has}} been very heavy on him. He paid money to put two of his boys into trade who died afterwards, and then for years he had either doctors or undertakers about the place. So I just went down to <b>him</b> and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would <b>do</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Said to <b>him?</b> oh, <b>I</b> don't know. He {{offered to}} give me a pair of guns, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not accept {{presents}} from my acquaintances. Really, Honoria, I don't want to interfere with your way of life, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand how you can associate with such people as this Mr. Dunstan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your uncle! I was so {{amazed and}} stupefied {{yesterday}} that I don't know whether <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> and if <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> don't think he believed me." ...|$|R
60|$|He treated us handsomely indeed, {{and paid}} the money cheerfully enough; so that it cost him #200 in all, or rather more. At our last meeting, when all was agreed, {{the case of the}} {{journeyman}} came up, and the mercer begged very hard for him; told me he was a man that had kept a shop of his own, and been in good business, had a wife, and several children, and was very poor; that he had nothing to make satisfaction with, but he should come to beg my pardon on his knees, if I desired it, as openly as I pleased. I had no spleen at the saucy rogue, nor were his submissions anything to me, since {{there was nothing to be}} got by him, so I thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not; so I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not desire the ruin of any man, and therefore at his request I would forgive the wretch; it was below me to seek any revenge.|$|E
60|$|This {{was really}} so prudently and wisely managed, that I found {{my son was}} a man of sense, and needed no {{direction}} from me. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wonder that his father was as he had described him, for that his head was a little touched before I went away; and principally his disturbance was because I could not be persuaded to conceal our relation and to live with him as my husband, after I knew that he was my brother; that as he knew better than I what his father's present condition was, I should readily join with him in such measure as he would direct; that I was indifferent as to seeing his father, since I had seen him first, and he could not have told me better news than to tell me that what his grandmother had left me was entrusted in his hands, who, I doubted not, now he knew who I was, would, as he said, do me justice. I inquired then how long my mother had been dead, and where she died, and told so many particulars of the family, that I left him no room to doubt the truth of my being really and truly his mother.|$|E
6000|$|I still {{pressed him}} not to stay late, {{and he said he}} would not. [...] "But if I am kept late," [...] says he, [...] "beyond my expectation, I'll stay all night, and come next morning." [...] This seemed a very good caution; but still my mind was very uneasy about him, and I told him so, and entreated {{him not to}} go. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what might be the reason, but that I had a strange terror upon my mind about his going, and that if he did go, I was persuaded some harm would attend him. He smiled, and returned, [...] "Well, my dear, if it should be so, you are now richly {{provided}} for; all that I have here I give to you." [...] And with that he takes up the casket or case, [...] "Here," [...] says he, [...] "hold your hand; there is a good estate for you in this case; if anything happens to me 'tis all your own. I give it you for yourself;" [...] and with that he put the casket, the fine ring, and his gold watch all into my hands, and the key of his scrutoire besides, adding, [...] "And in my scrutoire there is some money; it is all your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His conduct to Mr. Bonteen {{has been}} outrageous; {{and if he}} has done it just because that Duchess of Omnium has <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> really <b>do</b> {{think that he is}} not fit to rule the nation. As for Mr. Phineas Finn, it is dreadful to think that a {{creature}} like that should be able to interfere with such a man as Mr. Bonteen." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew that}} as well as he <b>did.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not tell <b>him</b> so. Any more than <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what {{defensive}} weapon my right hand rested on in my pocket, as I walked by his side. Any more than <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> why <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not walk on the sea side of him with the night closing in.|$|R
60|$|He {{made such}} a noise that the {{landlord}} wot was waiting for 'is money, asked 'im wot he meant by it, and, arter he 'ad explained, I'm blest if the landlord didn't advise him to search me. I stood still and let George go through my pockets, and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>I</b> 'ad <b>done</b> with <b>'im</b> and <b>I</b> never wanted to see 'im agin as long as I lived.|$|R
