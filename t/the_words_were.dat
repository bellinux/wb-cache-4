5|$|Historically in Britain, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> not {{restricted}} to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were {{used to refer to}} anything that the Anglo-Saxons associated with the Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Celtic Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire), as well as items associated with non-Germanic Europeans, such as the walnut.|$|E
5|$|Outraged by {{this act}} of police violence, local anarchists quickly printed and {{distributed}} fliers calling for a rally the following day at Haymarket Square (also called the Haymarket), which was then a bustling commercial center near the corner of Randolph Street and Desplaines Street. Printed in German and English, the fliers claimed {{that the police had}} murdered the strikers on behalf of business interests and urged workers to seek justice. The first batch of fliers contain the words Workingmen Arm Yourselves and Appear in Full Force! When Spies saw the line, he said he would not speak at the rally unless <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> removed from the flier. All but a few hundred of the fliers were destroyed, and new fliers were printed without the offending words. More than 20,000 copies of the revised flier were distributed.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, The Internationale replaced the Tautiška giesmė. When in 1944 'The Internationale' {{have been replaced}} by State Anthem of the Soviet Union in Soviet Union as official anthem, Tautiška giesmė was used as official anthem for the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. An alternate anthem was created and introduced in 1950. The music for that piece was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas Švedas, and <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> written originally by Antanas Venclova. Following Stalin's death in 1953, its lyrics were modified by Vacys Reimeris to remove reference to the former dictator. This anthem stated that Lenin had lit the path to freedom, helped by the Russian people, and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other Soviet Republics. The anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR. The song continued to be used until Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union. Already in 1988, the Tautiška giesmė was suggested as a replacement for the Soviet Lithuanian anthem. After preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR and successive legislative bodies, its status as the national anthem was reconfirmed in 1992. In that year, the Constitution of Lithuania was approved; Article 19 of the document states that Tautiška giesmė will be the national anthem of Lithuania. The last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in 1999; it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem.|$|E

25|$|The Greek {{belief of}} ideal forms was later {{extended}} by Plato in his metaphysical theory of forms (ideai:ideas).

Originally, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> applied to such obvious forms as the human body.

25|$|The Clemson University {{alma mater}} {{originated}} in the 1910s after a group of Clemson ROTC cadets in May 1918 was asked to sing the school's song at a gathering of ROTC cadets in Plattsburg, New York; {{they were unable to}} do so, as Clemson had no song at the time. One of the cadets in attendance, A.C. Corcoran of Charleston, South Carolina, decided to remedy the situation and wrote the words to the alma mater and set them to Annie Lisle, which was the melody of Cornell University's alma mater, as well as many others. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> later officially accepted by the then-named Clemson Agricultural College as the alma mater and was first performed by the Clemson Glee Club on February 17, 1919.|$|E

Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams.
