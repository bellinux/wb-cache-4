50|$|Regular {{semantics}} is a computing term {{which describes}} one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{provided by a}} data register shared by several processors in a parallel machine or in a network of computers working together. Regular semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers. These semantics are stronger than safe semantics but weaker than atomic semantics: they guarantee {{that there is a}} total order to the write operations which is consistent with real-time and that read operations return either the value of the last write completed before the read begins, or that of one of the writes which are concurrent with the read.|$|E
40|$|In {{automobile}} insurance, it {{is useful}} to achieve a priori ratemaking by resorting to gene- ralized linear models, and here the Poisson regression model constitutes the most widely accepted basis. However, insurance companies distinguish between claims with or without bodily injuries, or claims with full or partial liability of the insured driver. This paper exa- mines an a priori ratemaking procedure when including two different types of claim. When assuming independence between claim types, the premium can be obtained by summing the premiums for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> and is dependent on the rating factors chosen. If the independence assumption is relaxed, then it is unclear as to how the tariff system might be affected. In order to answer this question, bivariate Poisson regression models, suitable for paired count data exhibiting correlation, are introduced. It is shown that the usual independence assumption is unrealistic here. These models are applied to an automobile insurance claims database containing 80, 994 contracts belonging to a Spanish insurance company. Finally, the consequences for pure and loaded premiums when the independence assumption is relaxed by using a bivariate Poisson regression model are analysed...|$|E
40|$|Securities on {{movables}} {{are one of}} {{the major}} feature of credit mechanisms. Under domestic law, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> is widely used, specifically in France, Great-Britain and Canada, under different forms. On the other hand, due to legal uncertainties surrounding operations bearing an international character, securities on movables are rarely used in international transactions. Regrettably, this established fact, particularly illustrated by French law, appears to go against modern tendencies to favour the internationalisation of commercial activities. The analysis of the rules of French private international law {{in the light of the}} corresponding rules of English and Canadian law allows us to identify the main obstacles in the international traffic of securities on movables and to propose reforms initiatives. Consequently, the analysis of several ratified or drafted international conventions which are related to some aspects of securities on movables in an international context can bring suitable solutions to problems raised by the internationalisation of securities. This thesis proposes that these international agreements carrying conflict of law rules or uniform substantive law constitute the most promising means of regulating these mechanisms which are directly connected to modern international financing...|$|E
40|$|We present {{algorithms}} and hardness {{results for}} three resource allocation problems. The first is an abstract admission control problem where the system receives {{a series of}} requests and wants to satisfy as many as possible, but has bounded resources. This occurs, for example, when al-locating network bandwidth to incoming calls so the calls receive <b>guaranteed</b> quality <b>of</b> service. Algorithms can have performance guarantees for this problem either with respect to acceptances or with respect to rejections. These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> are incomparable and algorithms having dif-ferent <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> can have nearly opposite behavior. We give two procedures for combining one algorithm <b>of</b> each <b>type</b> into a single algorithm having both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> simultaneously. Specifically, if we combine an algorithm that is cA-competitive for acceptances with an algorithm that is cR-competitive for rejections, the combined algorithm is O(cA) -competitive for acceptance and O(cAcR) -competitive for rejections. If both the input algorithms are deterministic, then so is the combined algorithm. In addition, one of the combining procedures {{does not need to}} know the value of cA and neither needs to know the value of cR. The second problem we consider is scheduling with rejections, a combination of schedulin...|$|R

We find that three single-layer networks all have the scale-free property and are of disassortative nature. A single-layer network is not quite representative of another single-layer network. The result of the betweenness centrality shows that central companies in one layer are not necessarily central in another layer. And the eigenvector centrality has the same result of the betweenness centrality except the top central company...|$|R
40|$|The Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWBs) are {{optional}} riders {{provided by}} insurance companies in variable annuities. They guarantee the policyholders' ability to get the initial investment back by making periodic withdrawals regardless {{of the impact of}} poor market performance. With GMWBs attached, variable annuities become more attractive. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> can be challenging to price and hedge. We employ two approaches to price GMWBs. Under the constant static withdrawal assumption, the first approach is to decompose the GMWB and the variable annuity into an arithmetic average strike Asian call option and an annuity certain. The second approach is to treat the GMWB alone as a put option whose maturity and payoff are random. Hedging helps insurers specify and manage the risks of writing GMWBs, as well as find their fair prices. We propose semi-static hedging strategies that offer several advantages over dynamic hedging. The idea is to construct a portfolio of European options that replicate the conditional expected GMWB liability in a short time period, and update the portfolio after the options expire. This strategy requires fewer portfolio adjustments, and outperforms the dynamic strategy when there are random jumps in the underlying price. We also extend the semi-static hedging strategies to the Heston stochastic volatility model...|$|E
40|$|Delivering fair {{recovery}} {{following a}} service failure {{is crucial for}} a firm for restoring customer satisfaction, repatronage, and perceptions of fairness. In addition to the recovery efforts by employees, organizational policies, such as guarantees, are argued to impact fairness perceptions. Given that businesses extensively use service guarantees, research on perceptions of fairness towards such policies is relevant for designing effective guarantee policies. In this study, service guarantees are contended to function as service recovery tools, and signal the firm’s intentions to deliver justice/fairness. Drawing on signaling, attribution and justice theories, the study investigates the impact of guarantee terms on recovery fairness perceptions and attributions of negative motive. Employing a scenario-based experiment, this study shows that customer perceptions of recovery fairness {{vary according to the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> payout. Payout {{in the form of a}} discount does not restore fairness perceptions, and it even increases attributions of the firm’s negative motive for offering the guarantee. When combined with refund, discount generates positive inequity and related feelings of guilt. The study contributes to knowledge by showing that service guarantee policies function as service recovery tools. Importantly, the interface of signaling, attribution and justice theories explains how customers form perceptions of justice towards service guarantees. Implications for management comprise the need to avoid overcompensation in order to restore fairness perceptions and lower attributions of negative motive...|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} {{commercial}} world guarantees {{have become an}} important instrument. Guarantees {{are not limited to}} those given by a bank in the commercial world. Guarantees may also be issued by a parent company on behalf of a subsidiary, or by an individual(s) in personal transactions. The question then is what is a contract of guarantee? A guarantee is an assurance or security issued by one party (the guarantor) {{at the request of the}} party with the liability (the principal) to the party the liability is owed to (the beneficiary). Guarantees are discussed in this paper in the context of bank issued guarantees in shipbuilding contract. In shipbuilding contracts there are two types of guarantees issued – (i) refund guarantees, and (ii) payment guarantees. When payment is due under a guarantee, irrespective of if it is a refund guarantee or a payment guarantee, is dependent upon if it is a traditional guarantee type, or an on-demand bond type. The aim of this thesis is to examine the distinction between the true guarantee type and the on-demand bond type under English law. At the same time the objective of this thesis is to analyse the legal literature and the English common law cases to understand how a refund guarantee issued in shipbuilding contracts is conceived by the English courts to be either an on-demand bond or true guarantee. What are true guarantees and on-demand bonds? What are the distinguishing characteristics of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee...</b>|$|E

In particular, it examines the extent of dualism in these four countries in the financing, ownership and management of rental housing and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> social <b>guarantees</b> offered by governments to households in different rental sectors. The paper concludes that the welfare regime concept has some relevance in explaining dualism in rental housing in the four countries, as reflected in different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> offered to households through social housing and housing allowances. It finds, however, that there is passive rather than active government support for private rental markets and that different institutional arrangements in the four countries lead to differences in the extent of government support for private renters...|$|R
