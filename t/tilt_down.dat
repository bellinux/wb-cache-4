It had been constructed on a coast that had no natural harbors and served as an important commercial harbor in antiquity, rivaling Cleopatra’s harbor at Alexandria. [...] Josephus wrote: “Although the location was generally unfavorable, [...] contended with the difficulties so well that the solidity of the construction could not be overcome by the sea, and its beauty seemed finished off without impediment.” [...] However, there were underlying problems that led to its demise. [...] Studies of the concrete cores of the moles have shown that the concrete was much weaker than similar pozzolana hydraulic concrete used in ancient Italian ports. [...] For unknown reasons, the pozzolana mortar did not adhere as well to the kurkar rubble as it did to other rubble types used in Italian harbors. [...] Small but numerous holes in some of the cores also indicate that the lime was of poor quality and stripped out of the mixture by strong waves before it could set. [...] Also, large lumps of lime were found in all five of the cores studied at Caesarea, which shows that the mixture was not mixed thoroughly. [...] However, stability would not have been seriously affected if the harbor had not been constructed over a geological fault line that runs along the coast. [...] Seismic action gradually took its toll on the breakwaters, causing them to <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> and settle into the seabed.

40|$|Tilting {{is known}} to cause changes in {{hemodynamics}} due to hydrostatic pressure. The present study is an analysis of changes in cerebral hemodynamics measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) following <b>tilting</b> up and <b>down</b> in preterm and term infants. A significantly different effect of tilting up in comparison to <b>tilting</b> <b>down</b> on total hemoglobin in preterm infants and on the 'hemoglobin oxygenation index' in preterm and term infants was observed. In preterm infants, <b>tilting</b> up and <b>down</b> had a significantly different effect on cerebral blood volume (CBV), with an increase after <b>tilting</b> <b>down</b> and a decrease after tilting up. In term infants, tilting had no significant effect on CBV comparing these two procedures. We think that MRS provides a good method to measure cerebral hemodynamics following tilting, whereby different reactions in infants of different postconceptional age can be observed.

40|$|DistÃrbios {{cardiovascular}}es como a insuficiÃncia cardÃaca e sÃndrome coronariana aguda ocasionam com frequÃncia desordens gastrintestinais, sugerindo a interveniÃncia do sistema cardiovascular no trato gastrintestinal (TGI). VariaÃÃes agudas da volemia alteram o comportamento motor do TGI, contudo, as intervenÃÃes utilizadas para investigar tal fenÃmeno, envolvem manobras invasivas. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste na avaliaÃÃo das variaÃÃes posturais passivas advindas do teste de inclinaÃÃo como ferramenta nÃo-invasiva para promover a redistribuiÃÃo espontÃnea da volemia e analisar os ajustes fisiolÃgicos advindos desta modificaÃÃo hemodinÃmica. Para tal, ratos foram anestesiados, dotando-os de cateteres e realizaÃÃo de gastrostomia para obtenÃÃo da monitoraÃÃo hemodinÃmica e anÃlise da motilidade gastrintestinal. No oitavo dia apÃs as cirurgias, os ratos foram submetidos por 75 min Ã monitoraÃÃo contÃnua da PressÃo Arterial MÃdia (PAM, mmHg), FrequÃncia CardÃaca (FC, b. p. m.), PressÃo Venosa Central (PVC, mmHg) e DÃbito CardÃaco (DC, mL/min). ApÃs os 30 min iniciais de monitoraÃÃo (perÃodo basal), os ratos foram alimentados com a refeiÃÃo teste (vermelho de fenol 0, 75 mg/ml e glicose 5 %), via sonda gÃstrica. Em seguida, foram submetidos Ã sÃbita mudanÃa postural: Grupo aclive (tilt up + 75 Â) ou Grupo declive (<b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> - 75 o), ou mantidos sob posiÃÃo horizontal (Grupo controle). Decorridos 10, 20 ou 30 min, os animais foram eutanasiados para avaliaÃÃo da recuperaÃÃo fracional do corante no estÃmago. Em seguida foi avaliado o trÃnsito intestinal por infusÃo de refeiÃÃo teste via sonda gÃstrica diretamente no intestino delgado 10 min pÃs prandial. Via manometria foi realizada a avaliaÃÃo das contraÃÃes gÃstricas por meio de um balÃo inserido no estÃmago, para determinaÃÃo da frequÃncia e amplitude das contraÃÃes gÃstricas, e o Ãndice de motilidade. O aclive (tilt up + 75 Â) aumentou (P< 0, 05) a PAM, FC e o DC. A PVC apresentou uma resposta bifÃsica (P< 0, 05). No contexto do comportamento motor gastrintestinal, o aclive por sua vez acelerou (P< 0, 05) o esvaziamento gÃstrico de lÃquido e deslocou a linha de base da manometria, sugerindo o aumento no tÃnus gÃstrico. JÃ o sÃbito declive (<b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> - 75 Â), aumentou (P< 0, 05) a PVC e o DC, bem como a FC e PAM. No TGI, o declive aumentou a (P< 0, 05) a retenÃÃo gÃstrica, enquanto reduziu a amplitude das contraÃÃes gÃstricas. Tanto o aclive quanto o declive nÃo modificaram o trÃnsito intestinal de lÃquido. Desta forma, mudanÃas posturais passivas, seja mediante o sÃbito aclive (tilt up + 75 Â) ou declive (<b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> - 75 Â), alÃm de ocasionar reajustes hemodinÃmicos modificam o comportamento motor do TGI em ratos acordados. Cardiovascular disorders such {{as heart}} failure and acute coronary syndrome cause gastrointestinal disorders with frequency, suggesting the intervention of cardiovascular physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Acute variations in blood volume change motor behavior of GIT, however, interventions used to investigate this phenomenon involve invasive procedures. Thus, postural changes resulting from passive tilt testing emerge as a noninvasive tool to promote spontaneous redistribution of blood volume and {{the analysis of the}} physiological role of this phenomenon. For such rats were anesthetized, endowing them with catheters and performing gastrostomy for obtaining hemodynamic monitoring and analysis of gastrointestinal motility. On the eighth day after surgery, the rats was submitted for 75 min to continuous monitoring of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP, mmHg), Heart Rate (HR, b. p. m.), Central Venous Pressure (CVP, mmHg) and Cardiac Output (CO, mL / min). After the initial 30 minutes monitoring (baseline period), the rats were fed the test meal (phenol red 0. 75 mg / ml and 5 % glucose) via gastric tube. Then underwent sudden postural change: Group tilt up (+ 75 Â) or <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> group (- 75 Â), or kept in a horizontal position (control group). After 10, 20 or 30 min, animals were euthanized for evaluation of the fractional recovery of the dye in the stomach. Then we evaluated the intestinal transit by infusion of test meal via gastric tube directly into the small intestine 10 min postprandial. Manometry were performed via the evaluation of gastric contractions by a balloon inserted into the stomach to determine the frequency and amplitude of gastric contractions and motility index. The tilt up (+ 75 Â) increased (P < 0. 05) the MAP, HR and the CO. CVP showed a biphasic response (P< 0. 05). In the context of gastrointestinal motor behavior, the tilt-up accelerated (P< 0. 05) the gastric emptying of liquid and shifted baseline manometry, suggesting an increase in gastric tone. Have a sudden <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> (- 75 Â) increased (P< 0. 05) the PVC and CO, as well as the HR and MAP. GIT in the <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> increased (P< 0. 05) gastric retention, while reducing the amplitude of gastric contractions. Both tilt up and <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> not modify the intestinal transit liquid. Thus, passive position changes, either by sudden tilt up (+ 75 Â) or <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> (- 75 Â), and increases to cause hemodynamic changes the motor behavior of the gut in awake rats...|$|E

Tilt signals at DAK indicate a rapid <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> {{to the north of}} almost 5.5 μrad and 4.6 μrad down to the east that largely decayed during the next few hours. This was preceded and followed by changes in electric field at both DAK and MCL of up to 100  mV/km in amplitude. The tilt changes were accompanied by increased seismic swarm noise and a decrease of 4.8  °C in the ground temperature at DAK together with smaller fluctuations in ground temperature and decreases in both NS and EW electric field components of less than 80  mV/km at MCL.|$|E

40|$|Through {{analysis}} of seismic ambient noise {{recorded by the}} GHENGIS array, we constructed a high-resolution 3 -D crustal shear-wave velocity model for the central Tien Shan. The obtained shear-wave velocity model provides insight into the detailed crustal structure beneath the Tien Shan. The results obtained at shallow depths are well correlated with known subsurface geological features. Low velocities are found mainly beneath sedimentary basins, whereas high velocities are mainly associated with mountain ranges. At greater depths of similar to 43 - 45 km, high velocities were observed beneath the Tarim Basin and Kazakh Shield; these high velocities extend forward in opposite directions and <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> towards the central Tien Shan {{to a depth of}} in excess of 50 km, most likely reflecting lateral variations in crustal thickness beneath the Tien Shan and surrounding platforms...|$|E

40|$|Most {{research}} on multiferroics and magnetoelectric effects {{to date has}} focused on inorganic oxides. Molecule-based materials are a relatively new field in which to search for magnetoelectric multiferroics and to explore new coupling mechanisms between electric and magnetic order. We present magnetoelectric behavior in NiCl 2 - 4 SC(NH 2) 2 (DTN) and CoCl 2 - 4 SC(NH 2) 2 (DTC). These compounds form tetragonal structures where the transition metal ion (Ni or Co) is surrounded by four electrically polar thiourea molecules [SC(NH 2) 2]. By tracking the magnetic and electric properties of these compounds {{as a function of}} magnetic field, we gain insights into the coupling mechanism by observing that, in DTN, the electric polarization tracks the magnetic ordering, whereas in DTC it does not. For DTN, all electrically polar thiourea molecules tilt in the same direction along the c-axis, breaking spatial-inversion symmetry, whereas, for DTC, two thiourea molecules tilt up and two <b>tilt</b> <b>down</b> with respect to c-axis, perfectly canceling the net electrical polarization. Thus, the magnetoelectric coupling mechanism in DTN is likely a magnetostrictive adjustment of the thiourea molecule orientation in response to magnetic order...|$|E

This study describes the differences in gait and body position of cats walking uphill, downhill and on level surfaces. Proprioceptive (Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles) and exteroreceptive (optic, vestibular and cutaneous) receptors work alone or in combination to adjust the CPG to sensory feedback. The study explored the effects of neck proprioceptors (giving information about the relative location {{of the head and}} body) and vestibular receptors (giving information about the orientation of the head relative to gravity). Decerebrate cats were made to walk on a level surface with their heads level, tilted up or <b>tilted</b> <b>down.</b> Comparing the decerebrate cats to normal cats showed similar EMG patterns during level walking and EMG patterns that reflected downhill walking with the head titled up and uphill walking with the head <b>tilted</b> <b>down.</b> This study proved that neck proprioceptors and vestibular receptors contribute sensory feedback that alters the gait of the animal. This information may be useful for treatment of gait disorders.|$|R
