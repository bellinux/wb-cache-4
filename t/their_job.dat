5|$|On November 20, 1985, {{one week}} later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000relief workers and rescue team members were {{still searching for}} survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the {{official}} death toll was registered at 22,540people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000homeless, and 4,000injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the relief workers, <b>their</b> <b>job</b> was over.|$|E
5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} the kick through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed {{because of the lack of}} an offside rule. The job of the man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal and wait for a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs. Despite their name <b>their</b> <b>job</b> was to man mark the kick through.|$|E
5|$|There are two kidneys located dorsally, {{near the}} roof of the body cavity. <b>Their</b> <b>job</b> is to filter the blood of {{metabolic}} waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea.

5|$|There {{were over}} 13,000 Royal Military Police (“redcaps”). They were unpopular, {{at a time}} when the police were often unpopular with young men from big cities.

During the March 1918 retreat 25,000 stragglers were rounded up and sent back to fighting units. Royal Military Police also fought on occasion if headquarters areas were threatened by an enemy advance. Although soldiers sometimes told lurid tales of men who refused to fight being shot by Military Police, no reliable first-hand accounts exist of this happening.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% denominated in foreign currencies, debt payment {{is going to be more}} costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According to the president of the Icelandic Federation of Labour (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost <b>their</b> <b>job</b> in October, after the economic collapse.|$|E
40|$|Although {{private equity}} firms are often criticized for layoffs, little {{evidence}} exists regarding which employees lose <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> and why.

We show that workers in less productive firms who perform routine or offshorable job tasks {{are more likely to}} lose <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> The opposite trend holds for workers who perform non-routine or non-offshorable job tasks. Moreover, workers who belong to aggressive labor unions are more likely to lose <b>their</b> <b>jobs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Because staff {{attitudes and}} affects are impediments or {{strengths}} in appropriately assessing and managing traumatized or violent patients, the authors discuss {{the need to}} explore staff's experience with trauma and violence. A survey of social service field and administrative office-based staff revealed that numerous staff had experienced traumatic events. Compared with staff based in a downtown administrative office, significantly more field-based staff were dissatisfied with <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood and perceived <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood as a dangerous place to work. Further, significantly more field staff perceived that <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighbors would be "unlikely" to intervene in observed antisocial behaviors. In our sample of primarily female, African-American, social service staff, the ratio of victimization was higher than rates in other studies. Screening social service staff for experiences of trauma and victimization and asking about their perceptions about <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood will help leadership shape efforts to address these dynamics. By addressing staff's perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>job's</b> neighborhood, leadership can influence staff's willingness to participate in proactive community organizing and prevention activities designed to reduce violence and increase safety. Several recommendations to reduce violence in the workplace are presented...|$|R

5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. <b>Their</b> <b>job,</b> flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15.

As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried {{to talk him out of}} it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in fits of laughter.|$|E
5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing {{him to be a}} great man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton admitted that he had liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done <b>their</b> <b>job</b> on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. Bill O'Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{to find out whether}} the {{presence}} or the absence of social support for breastfeeding working mothers who return to work after maternity leave does have any significant effect on their level of satisfaction and also their commitment to <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> Three categories of social support were looked at: spousal and family members support, colleagues support at the workplace and support from care givers (house helps). A self administered questionnaire was given to 300 breastfeeding working mothers in Accra, Ghana. This group of mothers had their age range from 24 - 41 years with the mean age of 37. 2 years and standard deviation of 8. 8. The hypotheses were tested using Chi Square.

5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with <b>their</b> <b>job</b> could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract.

In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E
