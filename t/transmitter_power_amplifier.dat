This paper considers the classes of linear and nonlinear companding schemes and derives a sufficient condition under which the bit error rate (BER) performance of one is superior {{to that of the}} other. The high PAPR of the OFDM signal drives the <b>transmitter’s</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> into its nonlinear region, thus causing nonlinear distortions.

In this paper, the effect of nonlinear distortion occurring in the <b>transmitter</b> <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> (PA) and the receiver chain is analyzed, alongside with the dynamic range requirements of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This is done with detailed system calculations, which combine the properties of the individual electronics components to jointly model the complete transceiver chain, including self-interference cancellation. They also quantify the decrease in the dynamic range for the signal of interest caused by self-interference at the analog-to-digital interface. Using these system calculations, we provide comprehensive numerical results for typical transceiver parameters. The analytical results are also confirmed with full waveform simulations.
