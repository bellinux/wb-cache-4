500|$|Although {{the precise}} {{form of the}} {{original}} holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts {{provide insight into the}} festival as it was practiced at that time. Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged {{on the eve of the}} fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an [...] "orgy") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom. On <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to anoint the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year. Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as jaka, a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with suet in a decorative clay jar. The confit would then be conserved in an underground pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.|$|E

2500|$|The aircraft's flight {{recorders}} were located on 31 July, when Junaid Ameen, the director-general of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, told AFP that [...] "the investigating committee found {{the black box}} from the Margalla Hills <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> ... <b>the</b> black box was found from {{the bulk of the}} wreckage of the crashed plane." [...] He stated that the box would be examined by [...] "foreign experts" [...] in Germany or France as Pakistan does not possess the equipment to decode the {{flight recorders}}. He also stated that the process of extracting information may take six months to a year. The Pakistani authorities decided to send the CVR and FDR to the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) in France.|$|E
2500|$|Football pundits Johnny Giles, Eamon Dunphy and Graeme Souness, {{analysing}} {{the video}} replays on RTÉ Two, disputed whether Shay Given {{or anybody else}} was obscuring {{the view of the}} assistant referee from seeing the incident, although they were not certain the assistant could have flagged with certainty for handball even if he had a clear line of sight, due to the speed of the incident and flight of the ball. Former Irish international and football pundit Mark Lawrenson said [...] "The man cheated. He controlled the ball with the second handball. It is a Maradona moment". Another former Irish international Tony Cascarino wrote in The Times that Henry [...] "speaks so eloquently, but to me now he'll always be insincere, a faker, someone who cares only about himself". Former French international David Ginola said [...] "I'm very embarrassed by the situation...I don’t feel very proud to be French <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> Irish played very well and they deserved to go through as much as France, maybe more. I'm very surprised FIFA haven't mentioned anything about it – the whole world saw the handball. This is a pure injustice. Everyone in France, the press and everyone, says there should be a replay". Former Ireland captain Roy Keane said the attempt by the FAI to get a replay was [...] "rubbish", telling them to [...] "get over it", that France were there for the taking and Ireland should not have allowed Henry to be in such a good position in the first place. Keane later apologised to any Irish fans offended by his [...] "over the top" [...] comments.|$|E
