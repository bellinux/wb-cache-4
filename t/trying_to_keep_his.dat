5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Malden {{starred in}} Skag, an hour-long drama {{that focused on}} the life of a foreman at a Pittsburgh steel mill. Malden {{described}} his character, Pete Skagska, as a simple man <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> family together. The pilot episode for the series had Skag temporarily disabled by a stroke and explored the effects it had on his family and co-workers. While Skag met with poor ratings, critics praised it. In some instances, even full page ads were taken out in newspapers in an attempt to keep the program from being taken off the air. Nevertheless, the series was cancelled after several episodes. In 1987, he was the host/narrator for the second and third television specials that later became the long-running series Unsolved Mysteries.|$|E
25|$|Junot did {{his best}} to calm the {{situation}} by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> troops under control. However, his task was undercut by new orders from Napoleon. Junot was instructed to seize the property of the 15,000 persons who had fled to Brazil and to levy a 100 million franc fine on the nation. As it happened, the refugees had carried off almost half of the specie in Portugal and the French were barely able to raise enough money to maintain the occupation army. Nevertheless, the harsh taxes caused bitter resentment among the population. By January 1808 there were executions of persons who resisted the exactions of the French. The situation was dangerous, but most of the country's leaders had gone to Brazil, leaving no one to lead an insurrection.|$|E

500|$|... "A Very Glee Christmas" [...] is {{the tenth}} {{episode of the}} second season of the American musical {{television}} series Glee, and the thirty-second episode overall. It was written by series co-creator Ian Brennan, directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and premiered on Fox on December7, 2010. It served as the mid-season finale of season two—nearly two months elapsed before the next episode was aired—and featured Artie (Kevin McHale) <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend Brittany's (Heather Morris) belief in Santa Claus intact, and Sue (Jane Lynch) rigging the faculty Secret Santa gift exchange so she gets all the gifts, though she later becomes a Grinch when the gifts are repossessed.|$|E

500|$|... "Dumbbell Indemnity" [...] is {{the sixteenth}} {{episode in the}} ninth season of the American {{animated}} television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 1, 1998. It was written by Ron Hauge and directed by Dominic Polcino. The episode sees Moe <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> new girlfriend by using {{a large amount of}} money, but when it runs out, he decides to commit insurance fraud. Homer helps him, but is caught and sent to jail, and attempts to take revenge on Moe when he does not bail him out. Helen Hunt makes a guest appearance as Moe's girlfriend, Renee. The episode contains several cultural references and was generally well received.|$|E
500|$|An early {{pit stop}} during the safety car phase had put Sergio Pérez up into third place, with Daniel Ricciardo behind in fourth. By lap 43, Ricciardo, Bottas and Räikkönen had all moved into {{striking}} distance of Pérez, who was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> older tyres alive. On lap 45, Bottas used DRS to move ahead of Ricciardo's Red Bull. One lap later, Räikkönen tried to follow suit, only to run wide, having to concede the position back to Ricciardo. On lap 47, Carlos Sainz retired after spinning off the track due to a brake failure, losing his rear wing. Retrieving the wing from the track under racing conditions, a track marshall was called [...] "one very brave Russian" [...] by the passing Sebastian Vettel, who barely avoided contact. Just after being passed by Räikkönen on lap 49, Daniel Ricciardo had to retire with a suspension failure. The end of lap 52 saw Valtteri Bottas move ahead of Pérez into third place, with Räikkönen moving past the Force India as well. However, just some corners later on the last lap of the race, the two collided, forcing Bottas to retire and causing heavy damage to Räikkönen's Ferrari. Pérez thereby reclaimed third place and achieved Force India's first podium finish of the season. At the front, Vettel moved closer to Hamilton due to the latter suffering from a compromised rear wing, probably caused by rubber debris in the slot gap. However, Hamilton held on and took his ninth victory of the season, finishing ahead of Vettel, who was now his closest championship rival.|$|E
500|$|Matt Horner is {{the captain}} of the Raiders' {{flagship}} Hyperion and Raynor's second-in-command. Brian Bloom provides Horner's voice. Described as [...] "young and idealistic" [...] and guided by strong moral principles, Horner is originally a supporter of Mengsk, but becomes disgusted by Mengsk's deliberate attacks on civilian Confederate targets. Having come to admire Raynor's bravery and loyalty, Horner follows Raynor when he abandons Mengsk's cause, and is keen to strike at the morally bankrupt Terran Dominion. Horner is only an average combatant in personal combat, but is otherwise an excellent pilot and tactician. First introduced in the novel Queen of Blades, Horner commands the Hyperion as it comes under attack from Zerg in orbit of the planet Char and is forced to withdraw from the system, leaving Raynor and a small group of Raiders stranded on the surface; Horner is only able to return several months later to evacuate the survivors. Horner continues in a similar role in Wings of Liberty, acting as Raynor's conscience and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> commander focused. After the capture of James Raynor by Arcturus's Dominion forces in Heart of the Swarm, Matt Horner assumes temporary command of Raynor's Raiders, leading the rebel movement for much of the game until Raynor's return to the Hyperion after the raid aboard the prison ship Moros. During the events of Legacy of the Void, Horner is now an admiral commanding the Dominion fleet, joining the joint Dominion/protoss defense against Amon and his Moebius Corps forces. After Amon falls, Horner is the Dominion's chief military leader, as he and Emperor Valerian pledge to maintain peace and prosperity for the Dominion.|$|E

2500|$|In early December 1891, Canadian Dr. James Naismith, a {{physical}} education professor and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a [...] elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each [...] "basket" [...] or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so {{the bottom of the}} basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.|$|E
2500|$|On March 26, 1913, Venustiano Carranza {{issued the}} Plan de Guadalupe, which refused to {{recognize}} Huerta {{as president and}} called for war between the two factions. Soon after the assassination of President Madero, Carranza returned to Mexico to fight Huerta, but with {{only a handful of}} comrades. However, by 1913 his forces had swelled into an army of thousands, called the División del Norte (Northern Division). Villa and his army, along with Emiliano Zapata and Álvaro Obregón, united with Carranza to fight against Huerta. In March 1914 Carranza traveled to Ciudad Juárez, which served as rebellion's capital {{for the remainder of the}} struggle with Huerta. In April 1914 U.S. opposition to Huerta had reached its peak, blockading the regime's ability to resupply from abroad. Carranza <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> nationalistic credentials threatened war with the United States. In his spontaneous response to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson Carranza asked [...] "that the president withdraw American troops from Mexico.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky, {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Daredevil and Jessica Jones, serves as costume designer for Luke Cage as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that {{was introduced in}} Jessica Jones. Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the [...] "rich and colorful history" [...] of Harlem, and Coker's own vision. In looking {{to pay homage to}} Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.|$|E

2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Stephanie Maslansky {{returned from}} the same role on Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Like the main characters of those shows, Cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout the season after his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in Jessica Jones. The series opted to depict Cage in a Trayvon Martin-inspired hoodie, but introduces the character's classic costume for a brief flashback. Colter said that the costume, designed in the blacksploitation era, [...] "is not made for serious moments", but the series was able to poke fun {{at it in the}} brief scene, with Cage saying [...] "You look like a damn fool" [...] to himself when wearing it. In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. In contrast to Cage's hoodie, with jeans and T-shirts, many of the series' villains wear well-tailored suits. Stokes does this because he wants to present himself as [...] "a wealthy, successful businessman", and wears a lot of suits from Dolce & Gabbana and Zegna. One of his suits for the show was custom made. To pay homage to the comic character, Maslansky dressed Ali in a green suit for his introduction, using a [...] "subtle shade of green" [...] to avoid being [...] "flamboyant". The character subsequently is always wearing a [...] "subtle piece of green", like emerald earrings for one costume. The designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by the audience, but they made a difference to Ali when he was getting into character. For the character Shades, brands such as Hugo Boss, Helmut Lang, Prada, and Ferragamo were used [...] "because he wasn't trying to hide who he was", while Misty Knight, in her final shot of the season, is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume. That look includes leather pants and an [...] "interesting cold-shoulder"-shaped top; a cream-colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for the scene.|$|E
