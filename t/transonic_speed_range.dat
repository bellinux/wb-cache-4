50|$|A {{supercritical}} airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay the}} onset of wave drag in the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered (curved) aft section, and larger leading edge radius compared with NACA 6-series laminar airfoil shapes. Standard wing shapes are designed to create lower pressure {{over the top of}} the wing. The camber of the wing determines how much the air accelerates around the wing. As the speed of the aircraft approaches the speed of sound the air accelerating around the wing will reach Mach 1 and shockwaves will begin to form. The formation of these shockwaves causes wave drag. Supercritical airfoils are designed to minimize this effect by flattening the upper surface of the wing.|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} of reduced-order models for computing the unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamic loads on an aircraft from pitching motions in the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> is described. The models considered {{are based on}} Duhamelâ€™s superposition integral using indicial (step) response functions, Volterra theory using nonlinear kernels, radial basis functions, and a surrogate-based recurrence framework, both using time-history simulations of a training maneuver(s). Results are reported for the X- 31 configuration with a sharp leading-edge cranked delta wing geometry, including canard/wing vortex interactions. The validity of the various models studied was assessed by comparison of the model outputs with time-accurate computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of new maneuvers. Overall, the reduced-order models were found to produce accurate results, although a nonlinear model based on indicial functions yielded the best accuracy among all models.

It is often assumed that the effect of blunting the leading edge of a sharp aerofoil section, or increasing the leading-edge size of an already blunt section, inevitably leads to an increase in wave drag at supersonic freestream speeds.
