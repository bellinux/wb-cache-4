5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal <b>tuberosity.</b> Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a <b>tuberosity</b> bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced <b>tuberosity</b> in the middle.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect on}} movement under load of three different techniques for re-attachment of the <b>tuberosities</b> of the humerus using test sawbones. In the first, the <b>tuberosities</b> were attached both to the shaft and to each other, with one cerclage suture through the anterior hole in the prosthesis. The second technique was identical except for omission of the cerclage suture and in the third the <b>tuberosities</b> were attached to the prosthesis and to the shaft. An orthogonal photogrammetric system allowed all segments to be tracked in a 3 D axis system. The humeri were incrementally-loaded in abduction, and the 3 D linear and angular movements of all segments were calculated. Displacement between the <b>tuberosities</b> and the shaft was measured. The first and second techniques were the most stable constructs, with the third allowing greater separation of fragments and angular movement. Separation at {{the midpoint of the}} <b>tuberosities</b> was significantly greater using the latter technique (p < 0. 05). The cerclage suture added no further stability to the fixation...|$|R

5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal <b>tuberosity</b> is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial <b>tuberosity,</b> a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented long bone. It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P.madagascariensis. The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression of the shaft of the tibia, the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from the hand) and metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally. Among the few known phalanges, the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E
25|$|The tendon that {{attaches}} to the radial <b>tuberosity</b> is partially or completely surrounded by a bursa; the bicipitoradial bursa, which ensures frictionless motion between the biceps tendon and the proximal radius during pronation and supination of the forearm.|$|E

It finally attaches onto the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve (C7-C8) It is a persistence of one of the former contrahentes muscles that pulled the fingers or toes together.|$|E
25|$|The scapula {{had a large}} {{rectangular}} acromion, with a sharp upper corner, on {{the lower}} front edge. The more narrow coracoid had a rounded lower edge.

The <b>tuberosity</b> of the rear humerus serving as attachment for the musculus triceps brachii is well-developed but the vertical ridge running from it to below is not. In the pelvis, the pubic bone had a deep front part, the processus praepubicus, with a little upward projecting process as seen in Dacentrurus; the rear shaft had a lightly expanded tip.|$|E

40|$|This {{prospective}} follow-up {{study investigated the}} correlation between healing of the <b>tuberosities</b> and the functional outcome after arthroplasty with a trauma shoulder prosthesis in elderly patients with non-reconstructible humeral head fractures. Surgery was performed on 65 patients (66 shoulders) {{with a mean age}} of 74. 9 years. A total of 56 patients (57 cases) underwent clinical and radiological evaluation after a mean follow-up of 16 months (range: 4 to 62). Mean Constant Score was 50 and the age- and gender-corrected value was 73 %. The Constant Score was significantly higher (62 points, p = 0. 015) if the <b>tuberosities</b> healed. Mean ASES index was 68 and correlated significantly with the Constant Score (r = 0. 77). Healing of the <b>tuberosities</b> appears to be crucial to achieve good function in patients treated with a humeral head prosthesis. For elderly patients, the main objectives are to recover the ability to perform activities of daily living, to become pain free, and to reach a high level of satisfaction. All these criteria were largely achieved by the procedure described in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the human}} body there are {{numerous}} sites where tubercles develop. On bones, they are usually eminences used for muscle connections. Larger tubercles are also known as <b>tuberosities.</b> Within the lungs and on the genitals, tubercles are pathological.|$|R
25|$|Two muscles on {{the lateral}} {{side of the}} leg form the peroneal group. The peroneus longus and brevis both have their origins on the fibula and they both pass behind the lateral malleolus where their tendons pass under the peroneal retinacula. Under the foot, the longus {{stretches}} from the lateral to the medial side in a groove, thus bracing the transverse arch of the foot. The brevis is attached on the lateral side to the <b>tuberosity</b> of the fifth metatarsal. Together the two peroneals form the strongest pronators of the foot. The peroneus muscles are highly variable and several variants can occasionally be present.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal <b>tuberosity</b> under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal <b>tuberosity</b> adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tuberosity</b> on {{the inner}} surface of the top end of the humerus is rather poorly-developed in Xingxiulong, in {{contrast}} to the majority of basal sauropodomorphs (including Lufengosaurus and Yunnanosaurus). Like Yunnanosaurus and Jingshanosaurus, the ulna is about 61% the length of the humerus; this ratio is 68% in Lufengosaurus, resulting in a longer ulna. The top end of the ulna is quite expanded, with prominent anteromedial and anterolateral processes; these processes, along with the shallow radial fossa, collectively form the articulation of the ulna with the radius. The latter bone is slender and about 54% the length of the humerus. Parts of the hand, which bore at least four digits, are known but not well-described.|$|E
40|$|Biodynamic {{responses}} of the seated human body are usually measured and modelled assuming a single point of vibration excitation. With vertical vibration excitation, this study investigated how forces are distributed over the body-seat interface. Vertical and fore-and-aft forces were measured beneath the ischial <b>tuberosities,</b> middle thighs, and front thighs of 14 subjects sitting on a rigid flat seat in three postures with different thigh contact while exposed to random vertical vibration at three magnitudes. Measures of apparent mass were calculated from transfer functions between the vertical acceleration of the seat and the vertical or fore-and-aft forces measured at the three locations, and the sum of these forces. When sitting normally or sitting with a high footrest, vertical forces at the ischial <b>tuberosities</b> dominated the vertical apparent mass. With feet unsupported to give increased thigh contact, vertical forces at the front thighs were dominant around 8 Hz. Around 3 - 7 Hz, fore-and-aft forces at the middle thighs dominated the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass. Around 8 - 10 Hz, fore-and-aft forces were dominant at the ischial <b>tuberosities</b> with feet supported but at the front thighs with feet unsupported. All apparent masses were nonlinear: as the vibration magnitude increased the resonance frequencies decreased. With feet unsupported, the nonlinearity in the apparent mass was greater at the front thighs than at the ischial <b>tuberosities.</b> It is concluded that when the thighs are supported on a seat it is not appropriate to assume the body has a single point of vibration excitation. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThree- and four-part {{fractures}} of {{the proximal}} humerus are usually treated surgically. Open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) is {{the method of}} choice in younger patients. Anatomic reduction of the <b>tuberosities</b> is crucial to ensure that, {{in the event of}} poorly tolerated avascular necrosis of the humeral head, hemiarthroplasty can be performed under optimal conditions. Suboptimal outcomes may occur after ORIF, as less-than-perfect reduction and fixation is poorly tolerated at the shoulder. Preoperative computed tomography must be performed routinely to analyse fragment displacement and comminution, classify the fracture, assess humeral head vitality, and evaluate the mechanical properties of the underlying bone. Fracture reduction relies on principles that are shared by the various available techniques. Reduction of each fragment should be assessed separately. Reduction of the humeral head to the shaft should be performed before reduction of the <b>tuberosities.</b> The fixation technique should ensure stability of the anatomic reduction, with secure fixation of the <b>tuberosities</b> and a minimal risk of material migration into the joint. Here, we provide a detailed discussion of the various techniques, with their advantages and drawbacks, to help surgeons select the method that is most appropriate to each individual patient...|$|R
5000|$|The {{distance}} between the ischia bones is small in males, making the outlet narrow, but large in females, who have a relatively large outlet. The ischial spines and <b>tuberosities</b> are heavier and project farther into the pelvic cavity in males. The greater sciatic notch is wider in females.|$|R
25|$|The {{regions of}} the hip are all located in the thigh: anteriorly, the sub{{inguinal}} region is bounded by the inguinal ligament, the sartorius, and the pectineus and forms part of the femoral triangle which extends distally to the adductor longus. Posteriorly, the gluteal region corresponds to the gluteus maximus. The anterior region of the thigh extends distally from the femoral triangle to {{the region of the}} knee and laterally to the tensor fasciae latae. The posterior region ends distally before the popliteal fossa. The anterior and posterior {{regions of the}} knee extend from the proximal regions down {{to the level of the}} <b>tuberosity</b> of the tibia. In the lower leg the anterior and posterior regions extend down to the malleoli. Behind the malleoli are the lateral and medial retromalleolar regions and behind these is the region of the heel. Finally, the foot is subdivided into a dorsal region superiorly and a plantar region inferiorly.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{posterior}} thigh muscles. The biceps femoris has two heads: The long head has its origin on the ischial <b>tuberosity</b> {{together with the}} semitendinosus and acts on two joints. The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera on the shaft of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh, and acts on only one joint. These two heads unite to form the biceps which inserts {{on the head of}} the fibula. The biceps flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterally— it is the only lateral rotator of the knee and thus has to oppose all medial rotator. Additionally, the long head extends the hip joint. The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the biceps, and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the pes anserinus. The semitendinosus acts on two joints; extension of the hip, flexion of the knee, and medial rotation of the leg. Distally, the semimembranosus' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the pes anserinus profondus. Functionally, the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus, and thus produces extension at the hip joint and flexion and medial rotation at the knee.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} Istiodactylus was {{relatively}} short and broad compared to most other pterosaurs, {{and it had}} a short, low snout-region in front of the nostrils. Much of the skull was occupied by very large naso-antorbital fenestrae (openings which combine the antorbital fenestra and the bony nostril). Unusually, this opening extended past the jaw joint and the back of the mandible. The orbit (eye socket) was reclined and slender, and was capped at the front by a <b>tuberosity.</b> The hind part of the skull was relatively tall, and the skull table bore a low crest or ridge at the front. The mandibular symphysis was abbreviated, and the mandible was deepest where the mandibular rami (halves of the lower jaw) diverged. The maxilla of the upper jaw was very slender, and only [...] deep. The tip of the beak was rounded, blunt, and heavily built.|$|E
