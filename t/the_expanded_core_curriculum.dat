50|$|COSB schools educate {{a diverse}} {{population}} of learners in environments that promote the highest academic standards {{as well as}} {{meeting the needs of}} students with significant learning challenges. Schools and classrooms specialized approaches to instruction in small group settings ensure that the curriculum is fully accessible to each individual student. COSB schools excel at teaching the unique skills that students use to gain independence at the same level as their sighted peers. Known as <b>the</b> <b>Expanded</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Curriculum,</b> these skills such as Orientation and Mobility (travel and movement skills) and the use of Assistive Technology become the tools students use to maximize learning in school and to be fully engaged in their homes and communities.|$|E
50|$|According to Michael J.Bina, the 12th {{president}} of MSB since 2008, public schools cannot fully support {{students with visual}} impairments because they have not learned or been trained how to. He states that despite the government’s efforts to make all children regardless of disability feel welcomed and accepted in public schools, “schools for the blind and visually impaired continue to be relevant… The services of these institutions help visually handicapped students to gain access in normal educational settings. They provide the necessary support for attaining skills that would complement the ones they learn from public schools.” Therefore to accomplish this standard that President Bina has set for schools that intend to help the visually impaired, the Maryland School for the Blind, along with many other institutions for the blind, incorporate <b>the</b> <b>Expanded</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Curriculum.</b> Of course these schools teach subjects that are taught in public schools, such as history, math, English, etc, but they are known as the core curriculum. The Expanded Core Curriculum’s aim is to teach students the life skills that will help them become proficient in their core curriculum and eventually live well off on their own. The ECC covers nine aspects that the students need to learn: compensatory or functional academic skills, orientation and mobility, social interaction skills, independent living skills, recreation and leisure skills, career education, use of assistive technology, sensory efficiency skills, and self-determination. Each aspect focuses on a specific set of skills. The orientation and mobility aspect, for example, teaches students how to get around private and public environments - their own home, restaurants, parks, etc., special techniques - trailing, techniques on self-defense, cane skills, etc., and how to travel in unfamiliar or dangerous terrain - revolving doors, iced sidewalks, etc. Then there is the social interaction skills. It may sound unnecessary to those without any visual impairment, but the seeing learn social cues, such as gestures, the meaning of certain facial expressions, body positions, and movements, through what they see and hear. They are able to associate reactions and expressions to certain concepts even if they are not doing so intentionally. Understandably, the visually impaired cannot learn social skills through this method of sight. Therefore, the ECC carefully teaches the {{blind and visually impaired students}} numerous socials skills so that they can interact with those around them whether they be blind or not.|$|E
50|$|The {{philosophy}} of the Maryland School for the Blind is to educate their visually impaired students on not only school subjects, such as history, math, etc, but to also teach them skills and independence {{that they can use}} at and outside of the home. These skills are taught through <b>the</b> professional-development/teachers/expanded-core-curriculum/the-expanded-core-curriculum/12345 <b>Expanded</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Curriculum</b> and are available during school, after school, weekends, and even over summer vacation.

40|$|Acquisition of {{information}} is vital in academic life, and {{students with visual impairments}} need to have the same degree of access as their sighted peers. Information resources such as textbooks or professional journals are generally available only in printed format (Senge & Dote-Kwan, 1995), however, and access to materials prepared in alternative formats is limited. Equality of opportunity is a key premise of <b>the</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>core</b> <b>curriculum,</b> a major aim of which is enabling visually impaired students to live independently in society. It is essential, therefore, that students with visual impairments master the elements of <b>the</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>core</b> <b>curriculum</b> (Hatlen, 1996). The importance of reading in furthering this goal increases as students progress in their educational careers, especially as they prepare for exams or carry out homework assignments. When Abstract: Because students with visual impairments need auditory materials in order to access information, listening comprehension skills are important to their academic success. The present study investigated the effectiveness of summarization-based cumulative retelling strategy on the listening comprehension of four visually impaired college students. An adapted multiple-investigation design across subjects was used. Findings suggest that the instructional procedures led to increased listening comprehension among participants, and that these gains were maintained at follow-up 30 days later.

Given unique challenges {{for students who are}} blind and use braille, school readiness in the transition to and preparation for kindergarten is even more critical to their future academic success. If children who are blind and use braille as their primary learning medium have the necessary school readiness skills entering kindergarten, they will be better prepared to participate in the academic classroom. There is a need for additional research to illuminate the skills needed for school readiness for children who are blind and use braille so programs can tailor their resources to provide appropriate instruction and intervention. The purpose of this research is to describe and explain how Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVI) and primary caregivers construct the idea of school readiness for children who are blind and use braille as their primary learning medium.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the everyday work of eight {{teachers of students with}} visual impairments at governmental primary and secondary schools in Queensland, Australia. The small-scale study aimed to capture the scope and complexity of the activities of these teachers and the regular challenges they face in their expected everyday roles. Methods: Telephone interviews were used to collect descriptive data from the teachers. A direct field-sampling procedure was used across the governmental schools to recruit qualified and specialist teachers who met prespecified criteria, most of whom lived in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city. The content of the interviews was generated from two sequenced activities with a different group of experienced {{teachers of students with visual}} impairments. Results: The teachers carried out complex and demanding duties as part of their everyday roles. These duties were consistent with those performed by their counterparts around the world. The most frequently performed and most important activities including providing direct support to students, advocating for students' needs, and collaborating across school and community contexts. The identified challenges were linked primarily to the lack of time to undertake important activities. Discussion: Three important and interconnected findings can be drawn from the results: role complexity, time and collaboration, and the importance of <b>the</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>core</b> <b>curriculum.</b> Implications for Practitioners: The findings provide an initial snapshot of the changing role reported by the teachers. Thus, these data offer a beginning point for future probes into the workplace knowledge and skills required by teachers of students with visual impairments.

40|$|Orientation and {{mobility}} (O&M) {{is a key}} domain within <b>the</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>core</b> <b>curriculum</b> (ECC) of skills {{for children who are}} blind or have low vision. Although the O&M profession in Australia was established in the 1970 s, children have historically been denied opportunities to learn long cane mobility techniques at a very young age. This study explores the development of O&M intervention with children in Australia, discussing the influence of philosophies and pedagogies emanating from both the United Kingdom and the United States. O&M intervention, including long cane mobility, is examined from the perspectives of children, parents and vision education teachers within an Australian early childhood education context. The presentation of individual experiences and stories are rare within the O&M literature, and this study provides new understandings as to how O&M within the early childhood context is perceived and understood. Using an interpretive interactionist approach, which draws heavily on symbolic interactionist theory, the study captures the experiences and perspectives of fifteen participants toward early intervention O&M. Data were gathered from semi-structured interviews, with children’s written stories, archival video and document material used to support thematic findings. Findings indicate that, for parents and teachers, perspectives toward O&M intervention changed over time as young children demonstrated competent and responsible long cane mobility techniques. The long cane was seen as a natural extension of the child’s body, allowing independent access to all areas of learning and full participation in family life. Teachers and parents identified the importance of professional cooperative action in developing a shared language and goals supportive of O&M intervention, which subsequently extended into children’s inclusive education settings. The findings indicate that early O&M intervention can facilitate current Australian early childhood education learning outcomes, and is an essential domain within the early childhood ECC. The study also suggests the O&M profession look toward new ways of understanding how individuals who are blind perceive and travel through their world...|$|E

It is hypothesized that in chromaffin cells, where the dense core is believed to nearly fill <b>the</b> vesicle, <b>the</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>core</b> is a controlling factor in opening the fusion pore, that prefusion of two smaller vesicles leads to excess membrane, and that this slows pore expansion leading to an increased observation of events with a foot.

We analyze this event using a three-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the solar corona. The numerical simulation is driven and constrained by the observations, and indicates where magnetic reconnection occurs between <b>the</b> <b>expanding</b> CME <b>core</b> and surrounding environment. We focus primarily on the lower corona, extending out to 3 R⊙; this range allows simultaneous comparison with both EUVI and COR 1 data. Our simulation produces a diffuse coronal bright front remarkably similar to that observed by STEREO/EUVI at 195 ˚A. It {{is made up of}} two components, and {{is the result of a}} combination of both wave and non-wave mechanisms. The CME becomes large-scale quite low (< 200 Mm) in the corona. It is not, however, an inherently large-scale event; rather, the expansion is facilitated by magnetic reconnection between <b>the</b> <b>expanding</b> CME <b>core</b> and <b>the</b> surrounding magnetic environment. In support of this, we also find numerous secondary dimmings, many far from the initial CME source region. Relating such dimmings to reconnecting field lines within the simulation provides further evidence that CME expansion leads to the “opening ” of coronal field lines on a global scale. Throughout the CME expansion, the coronal wave maps directly to the CME footprint.
