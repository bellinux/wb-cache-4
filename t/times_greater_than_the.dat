5|$|Models of the {{evolution}} of the planet's orbit over time suggest that heating resulting from this tidal locking may {{play a major role in}} the planet's geology. Models proposed by scientists predict that tidal heating could yield a surface heat flux about three <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Jupiter's moon Io's, which could result in major geological activity such as volcanoes and plate tectonics.|$|E

40|$|A Delay Flip Flop (DFF) {{is used in}} {{the phase}} {{detector}} circuit of the clock and data recovery circuit. A DFF consists of the three important timing parameters: setup time, hold time, and clock-to-output delay. These timing parameters {{play a vital role in}} designing a system at the transistor level. This thesis paper explains the impact of metastablity on the clock and data recovery (CDR) system and the importance of calibrating the DFF using a metastable circuit to improve a system 2 ̆ 7 s lock time and peak-to-peak jitter performance. The DFF was modeled in MATLAB Simulink software and calibrated by adjusting timing parameters. The CDR system was simulated in Simulink for three different cases: 1) equal setup and hold times, 2) setup <b>time</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> hold <b>time,</b> and 3) hold <b>time</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> setup <b>time.</b> The Simulink results were then compared with the Cadence simulation results, and it was observed that the calibration of DFF using a metastable circuit improved the CDR system 2 ̆ 7 s lock time and jitter tolerance performance. The overall power dissipation of the designed CDR system was 2. 4 mW from a 1 volt supply voltage...|$|R
5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes {{a source of}} heat. Depending {{on the amount of}} tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|On {{the western}} side of the lower reaches of the Kettle Creek watershed, there is an {{underground}} mine complex with 26 sources of acid mine drainage. The acid mine drainage enters Kettle Creek, among other streams in the area and the sources of it have an average discharge of 479 gallons per minute. They also have 304 milligrams per liter of acidity, 44 milligrams per liter of iron, 21 milligrams per liter of aluminum, 8 milligrams per liter of manganese, and 930 milligrams per liter of sulfates. The alkalinity load from the Alvin R. Bush Dam is about 15 <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> acidity load from these acid mine discharges.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested {{that the amount of}} heat generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E

5|$|The {{first batch}} of {{herbicides}} was unloaded at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962. U.S. Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions {{took place over}} the course of Operation Ranch Hand. By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended U.S. Department of Agriculture application rate for domestic use. In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed.

5|$|Estimates of {{accepted}} described {{living species}} of molluscs vary from 50,000 {{to a maximum}} of 120,000species. In 1969 David Nicol estimated the probable total number of living molluscs at 107,000 of which were about 12,000 fresh-water gastropods and 35,000 terrestrial. The Bivalvia would comprise about 14% of the total and the other five classes less than 2% of the living molluscs. In 2009, Chapman estimated the number of described living species at 85,000. Haszprunar in 2001 estimated about 93,000named species, which include 23% of all named marine organisms. Molluscs are second only to arthropods in numbers of living animal species—far behind the arthropods' 1,113,000 but well ahead of chordates' 52,000. About 200,000 living species in total are estimated, and 70,000 fossil species, although the total number of mollusc species ever to have existed, whether or not preserved, must be many <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> number alive today.|$|E
5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-4b orbits {{its host}} star in 3.213 {{days at a}} {{distance}} of 0.046 AU. This places it almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun. Consequently, Kepler-4b is thought to be extremely hot, with an equilibrium temperature greater than 1700 kelvins (2600°F). The planet is estimated to be 25 times more massive than the Earth with a radius that is 4 <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Earth. This makes it similar to Neptune in terms of size and mass, but with a temperature that is not comparable to any planet in the Solar System (Venus, the hottest planet, is only 735 kelvins). Kepler-4b's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however an independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12, and a later reanalysis of the light curve discovered a secondary eclipse with depth 7.47 ± 1.82ppm at a phase of about 0.7.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} {{amphibian}} populations {{is an ongoing}} mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are {{known as one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity, and several causes are believed to be involved, including disease, habitat destruction and modification, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> background extinction rate and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.|$|E

The record number of theaters was later beaten by , which was released in 4,362 theaters in the United States109 more than Spider-Man 3. Tracking data {{a month before the}} U.S. release reflected over 90% awareness and over 20% first choice among moviegoers, statistics that estimated an opening weekend of over $100 million for Spider-Man 3. Online tickets for Spider-Man 3 were reported on April 23, 2007 to have been purchased at a faster ratethree times at Movietickets.com and four times at Fandangothan online ticket sales for Spider-Man 2. On May 2, 2007, Fandango reported the sales rate as six <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rate for Spider-Man 2.

50|$|The {{logarithm}} {{also has}} a useful effect on ratios. If we are comparing positive quantities X and Y using the ratio X / Y, then if X < Y, the ratio is in the unit interval (0,1), whereas if X > Y, the ratio is in the half-line (1,∞), where the ratio of 1 corresponds to equality. In an analysis where X and Y are treated symmetrically, the log-ratio log(X / Y) is zero {{in the case of}} equality, and it has the property that if X is K <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> Y, <b>the</b> log-ratio is the equidistant from zero as in the situation where Y is K <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> X (<b>the</b> log-ratios are log(K) and &minus;log(K) in these two situations).|$|R
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from {{scientific and technological}} developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact}} on the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E
