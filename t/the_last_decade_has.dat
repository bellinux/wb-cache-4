25|$|During the Nicaraguan Revolution in the 1980s, Nicaragua was not {{regarded}} {{as a place to}} travel, which caused a decrease in tourism.

Over the last 7 years tourism has grown about 70% nationwide with rates of 10%-16% annually.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Stockholm residents work in the service industry, which accounts for roughly 85% of jobs in Stockholm. The almost total absence of heavy industry (and fossil fuel power plants) makes Stockholm one of the world's cleanest metropolises. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen {{a significant number of}} jobs created in high technology companies. Large employers include IBM, Ericsson, and Electrolux. A major IT centre is located in Kista, in northern Stockholm.|$|E

25|$|Intensive marine {{aquaculture}} in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> increased considerably {{and resulted in}} considerable adverse environmental impacts. Large discharge volumes of organic matter from uneaten feed and excretory waste from aquacultured species has resulted in high levels of nutrients within coastal waters. Large quantities of nitrogen (~ 75%) excreted from bivalves, salmon and shrimp, enter into the coastal environment, {{with the potential to}} develop algal blooms, and reduce dissolved oxygen in the water.|$|E
25|$|Richmond's urban {{residential}} neighborhoods {{also hold}} particular {{significance to the}} city's fabric. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill and Church Hill (among others) are largely single use town homes and mixed use or full retail/dining establishments. These districts are anchored by large streets such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's growth in population over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been concentrated in these areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{reforms of}} the 1990s did not achieve their objectives. It had been {{expected}} that privatization would bring investment in new generation, but very little capacity was added {{in the years that}} followed the reform. Moreover, the generation capacity added in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been mainly dependent on liquid fuels, making the country more vulnerable to rising oil prices. In addition, as mentioned, distribution losses have remained at very high levels (28%). The reform also aimed at implementing gradual changes in electricity tariffs that would reflect costs, which proved to be politically unfeasible.|$|E

25|$|Black bear fat {{was once}} valued as a {{cosmetic}} article that promoted hair growth and gloss. The fat most favoured {{for this purpose}} was the hard white fat found in the body's interior. As {{only a small portion}} of this fat could be harvested for this purpose, the oil was often mixed with large quantities of hog lard. However, animal rights activism over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> slowed the harvest of these animals; therefore the lard from black bears has not been used in recent years for the purpose of cosmetics.|$|E
25|$|The only {{league in}} Portuguese cricket for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been the Lisbon league, {{which has been}} played by a varying number of local clubs (between three and seven) {{depending}} on the economic activity in the area. Most recently the National League has been contested by Lisbon-based teams and two new clubs – one from the Algarve and one from Almoster. There are four registered clubs – Asian CC, Oeiras CC, Comunidade Hindu Portuguesa CC (CHP), and Friends CC in the Lisbon area, with a club in Oporto (Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club), a club in the Algarve (Barrington's CC) and one from Almoster (Presban CC). Over the years the Asian CC has dominated the league.|$|E
25|$|While dog {{fighting}} was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues—and therefore rarely enforced, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> produced {{a growing body}} of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog-fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, and/or gangs. Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, and the dogs mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer on. Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid. There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dogfighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal. The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.|$|E

China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation. During this period China has succeeded in developing an innovation infrastructure, founded on the establishment of [...] over 100 science and technology parks in many parts of the country, along with encouragement of entrepreneurship outside the state-owned sector. [...] Yip and McKern argue that Chinese firms have evolved through three phases as their innovation capabilities have matured [...] and that by 2017 many of them are of world standard.

2500|$|... "The loss {{of tens of}} {{millions}} of vultures over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> had major ecological consequences across the Indian Subcontinent that pose a potential threat to human health. In many places, populations of feral dogs (Canis familiaris) have increased sharply from the disappearance of Gyps vultures as the main scavenger of wild and domestic ungulate carcasses. Associated with the rise in dog numbers is an increased risk of rabies" [...] and casualties of almost 50,000 people. The Government of India cites this as one of those major consequences of a vulture species extinction. A major shift in transfer of corpse pathogens from vultures to feral dogs and rats could lead to a disease pandemic causing millions of deaths in a crowded country like India; whereas vultures’ digestive systems safely destroy many species of such pathogens.|$|E
