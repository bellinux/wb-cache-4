500|$|Although {{not much}} is {{revealed}} about Stacy's early life, {{it is said}} in [...] "Acceptance" [...] {{that she is a}} Duke University graduate. Presumably ten years before the events of House, at a [...] "Doctors vs. Lawyers" [...] paintball game, she met Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) with whom she started a romantic relationship. Five years later, during a game of golf, House suffered an infarction in his right leg. He was admitted at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After he was put into a chemically induced coma to sleep <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the pain, Stacy, his medical proxy at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, which caused their relationship to end.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of severe back pains, Barkley began to {{speculate}} that the 1993–94 season {{would be his last}} in Phoenix. Playing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> injury problems of his career, Barkley managed 21.6 points on [...]495 shooting and 11.2 rebounds per game. He was selected to his eighth consecutive All-Star Game, but did not play because of a torn right quadriceps tendon, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. With Barkley fighting injuries, the Suns still managed a 56–26 record and made it to the Western Conference Semifinals. Despite holding a 2–0 lead in the series, the Suns lost in seven games to the eventual champions, the Houston Rockets, who were led by Hakeem Olajuwon. Despite his injuries, in Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors, Barkley hit 23 of 31 field-goal attempts and finished with 56 points, the then-third-highest total ever in a playoff game. After contemplating retirement in the offseason, Barkley returned for his eleventh season and continued to battle injuries. He struggled {{during the first half of}} the season, but managed to gradually improve, earning his ninth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game. He averaged 23 points on [...]486 shooting and 11.1 rebounds per game, while leading the Suns to a 59–23 record.

500|$|On 2 June 1916, Lipsett's {{commanding}} officer Malcolm Mercer {{was killed by}} enemy shellfire at Mount Sorrel in Belgium and Lipsett was given an acting promotion to replace him {{in command of the}} 3rd Canadian Division, [...] and a brevet promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel. The Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence Minister Sir Sam Hughes attempted to have him removed from the division in favour of Hughes' son Garnet, but Lipsett was so highly regarded in the Canadian military establishment that General Byng overruled Hughes. Lipsett led his division <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the campaigns in 1916, including extensive operations during the Battle of the Somme. He received promotion to substantive Lieutenant-Colonel in February 1917, and in April 1917 Lipsett's division was instrumental in the Canadian success at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The following September however the division took heavy casualties in bitter fighting at the Battle of Passchendaele. After each of these battles, Lipsett was forced to reconstitute and retrain his units with fresh drafts, so severe were the casualties the division took. In August, 1918 he was involved in the planning and execution of an assault on German positions by the entire Canadian Corps which is known as the Battle of Amiens which was completely successful and for which he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Through the rest of the month he was engaged in combat with the division, but at the start of September Arthur Currie and Douglas Haig arranged his transfer to the command of the British 4th Division in order that the Canadian Corps be entirely officered by Canadians.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{was slow to}} supply humanitarian aid, at first using propaganda to discourage hoarding. It attempted to drive rice paddy prices down through price controls {{and a series of}} procurement schemes. Price controls merely created a thriving black market and encouraged cautious sellers to withhold their stocks; moreover, prices soared when the controls were abandoned. Relief efforts in the form of gruel kitchens, agricultural loans and test works were both insufficient and ineffective <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> months of the food crisis phase. Despite having a long-established and detailed Famine Code that would have triggered a sizable increase in aid, the provincial government never formally declared a state of famine. Relief efforts increased significantly when the military took control of crisis relief in October 1943, and more effective aid arrived after a record rice harvest that December. Deaths from starvation began to decline, but [...] "very substantially more than half" [...] of the famine-related fatalities were caused by disease in 1944, after the food security crisis had subsided.|$|E

Finally, Joseph’s father was brought out to meet the Pharaoh. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal, it was an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh. The two chatted for a bit, the Pharaoh even inquiring of Israel’s age which happened to be 130 years old at that time. After the meeting, the families were directed to pasture in the land of Ramses where they lived in the province of Goshen. The house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of seventeen years, even <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the seven-year famine. (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|David H. Moffat and his {{business}} associates established the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway. It originated in Denver, and was planned to terminate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Construction began on December 18, 1902. [...] The DN started north up the Front Range of the Rockies towards Boulder. This ascent {{to the point where}} the line turned west, is a great example of exceptional mountain railroad surveying. Chief Engineer H.A. Sumner, needing to enter South Boulder Canyon as high as possible, did not want more than a 2% grade. To do this, he laid out an efficient route to gain the necessary altitude that features the now famous Big Ten Curve. The climb to the Continental Divide required 33 tunnels that were several hundred feet long. The tracks did not reach the western end of the Tolland area until 1903. Once completed, the 33 tunnels between Denver and Tolland are closer together than any other tunnels on any other line in the US. Rollins Pass was next over the divide at Corona, at an elevation , and then the line went down the western face of the divide. Originally, Moffat had planned to build a tunnel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> part of the pass, but his plans failed. Instead, the DNW tracks climbed Rollins Pass with a series of switch back loops requiring steep grades and experiencing severe snow conditions. The line over the pass was [...] long, with a 4% grade at many locations, and was the highest mainline railroad ever constructed in North America (the Argentine Central terminated at a higher elevation). A small rail stop called Corona was established at the top of the pass, with a restaurant and lodging, which allowed workers to keep the rail line free of snow in Winter. Trains were often stranded for several days during heavy Winter snows. Removing snow from the original line made it unprofitable to operate.|$|E
