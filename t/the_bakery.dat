5|$|Angel {{improved}} the bread-making operation by introducing Israel's first automated weighing machines and investing in new production lines. He often slept overnight at <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> {{during the week}} {{and returned to his}} home in Talpiot when <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> was closed on Shabbat. Later he built an apartment over <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> to house his family. In the 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> employed 25 workers and had one production line that turned out 8,500 loaves per day. It delivered bread to stores in two trucks and a horse and wagon. During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> contracted to supply bread to the British army, necessitating the purchase of large American-made ovens that could turn out 540 loaves per hour.|$|E
5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} which <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> overcame in {{the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
5|$|Angel Bakeries employs 1,800 workers, {{including}} Israelis, Palestinians, and new immigrants. Some of {{its workers}} are third-generation employees. In its over 80-year history, <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> {{has never had}} a strike.|$|E

50|$|In opposition-controlled {{cities and}} districts in Aleppo {{province}} and Aleppo city, {{reports indicate that}} the Syrian government is attacking civilians at bread bakeries with artillery rounds and rockets, with the reports indicating that <b>the</b> <b>bakeries</b> were shelled indiscriminately. HRW said these are war crimes, as the only military targets wherever the few rebels manning <b>the</b> <b>bakeries,</b> and that dozens of civilians were killed.|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s Salomon's three sons, Avraham, Ovadia and Danny, assumed {{managerial}} positions; {{they became}} co-CEOs after Salomon's death in 1966. In 1958 Angel's Bakery moved to its present {{location in the}} Givat Shaul industrial zone {{at the corner of}} Beit Hadfus and Farbstein Streets. The site was chosen because it stood across the street from a flour mill. The Angel brothers built Israel's first flour silo and commissioned a Texas company to construct a 750-foot pipeline to convey flour directly from the mill to the silo to <b>the</b> <b>bakery.</b> Today this pipeline brings 120 tons of flour to <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> daily. The invention, initially opposed by the Jerusalem municipality for being above-ground, won the Kaplan Prize for distinction in productivity and efficiency.|$|E

5|$|The Great Fire {{started at}} <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major {{firefighting}} technique {{of the time}} was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday {{into the heart of}} the City.|$|E
5|$|The campus also {{operates}} two restaurants. The Gatehouse Restaurant offers contemporary dishes using regional ingredients, and <b>the</b> <b>Bakery</b> Café by illy serves sandwiches, soups, salads, breads, desserts, and hot beverages {{prepared by}} students in the college's baking and pastry arts degree program.

50|$|Despite {{the closure}} being heavily publicized {{by the local}} media, the {{popularity}} of Roselyn Bakeries' products did not wane. In 2000, the Kroger grocery chain sold a limited-edition cookbook of <b>the</b> <b>bakery's</b> recipes. (Reprints of the cookbook have since been made available at Roselyn Recipe, <b>the</b> <b>bakery's</b> official website.) At the same time, a bakery in Chicago was contracted to produce {{a limited number of}} bakery products for distribution at local supermarkets.|$|R

5|$|To {{enter the}} whole wheat bread market, <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> {{imported}} its own wheat-cleaning machine from Hungary; the machine {{actually had to}} be smuggled out since Hungary did not have diplomatic relations with Israel at the time. However, health-food consumers were wary of the first whole-wheat loaves because they were white, not brown. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's {{came up with the}} solution of adding all-natural molasses to the bread to give it a brown color.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of River Street, south from the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum across the {{railroad}} tracks, the Mill Works Building, originally a foundry, contains the Ypsilanti Food Co-op and the River Street Bakery, owned by the co-op. On the roof of the Mill Works Building, Solar Ypsi installed 12 solar panels for the co-op in April 2009, followed by 30 panels for <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> in 2010, producing a total of 8.3kilowatts during peak sunlight.

5|$|The River Street Bakery, {{also in the}} Mill Works Building and {{now owned}} by the Co-op, claims to have the only {{wood-fired}} brick oven in commercial use in Washtenaw County. Originally called the Depot Town Sourdough Bakery, <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> was founded by Tom Kinney as an independent cooperative non-profit with a $20,000 loan from the Cooperative Whole Grain Education Association and pledges from prospective customers. To stretch the limited funds, the brick oven was built by hand in 1989. From the beginning, the Ypsilanti Food Co-op retailed the bread.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the story takes place {{primarily}} at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> run by Nagisa's parents, and the dormitory where Youhei Sunohara lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{residents}} of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One {{of the oldest and}} most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.|$|E
25|$|During the French {{occupation}} of Malta, <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> {{was used to}} produce bread for the French garrison, and it was heavily guarded during the blockade of 1798–1800. At this point, the street where <b>the</b> <b>bakery</b> was located, originally called Strada San Giovanni Battista, was renamed Rue des Fours after <b>the</b> <b>bakery.</b> It was later known as Strada Forni in Italian during the early British period, and since 1926 it has been called Old Bakery Street. It is known as Triq il-Fran or Triq l-Ifran in Maltese, {{but it is still}} commonly called Strada Forni by Valletta residents.|$|E
