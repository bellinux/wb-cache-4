Wheat gluten is often processed using extrusion to produce TVP. Processing aids, such as reducing agents (example, cysteine and sodium metabisulfite) and pH modifiers (example, tetra potassium phosphate) aid in <b>texturization.</b> Reduction of sulfhydryl groups, cleavage of disulfide bonds, and reformation of bonds between elongated protein molecules results in protein aggregation and <b>texturization.</b> This {{study focused on}} development of a fundamental understanding of these mechanisms for <b>texturization</b> using analytical tools such as the phase transition analyzer (PTA), in combination with lab- and pilot-scale extrusion. The abovementioned three chemicals were added to four varieties of gluten. The control treatment had no additives. PTA was used to understand the operative flow properties of gluten in an environment similar to an extrusion system. Addition of sulfite (0. 18 %) and cysteine (0. 18 %) lowered the thermal softening (Ts: 36. 6 - 44. 1 °C) and thermal flow (Tf: 79. 6 - 105. 6 °C) temperatures of all varieties of gluten {{as compared to the}} controls (Ts: 38. 8 - 48. 2 °C; Tf: 91. 7 - 112. 2 °C).

40|$|A novel Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 <b>texturization</b> {{process for}} the surface {{structuring}} of the monocrystalline silicon substrate, aimed to improve the silicon optical characteristics {{to be used in}} solar cells, has been proposed in this thesis. The proposed process consists in the wet chemical anisotropic <b>texturization</b> of (100) oriented silicon with a new solution which has been designated as ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution. The alkaline solution forms micrometric pyramids on the (100) silicon surface. This process presents several operation advantages: (i) no additives are required, contrarily to NaOH or KOH based processes; (ii) the 20 times lower concentration of chemicals compared to previously established high concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 processes allows saving costs and simplifies a possible implementation in the industry; (iii) the process temperature at semi-industrial scale is lower than the temperature of Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 <b>texturization</b> processes found in the literature; (iv) the texturing solution can be reused several times; and (v) it can be applied to (100) silicon substrates with different characteristics. The resulting morphology obtained with the ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution presents low values of standard weighted reflectance and smaller and more sharpened pyramids than the high concentration <b>texturization</b> process. Furthermore, it produces smoother facets of the pyramids, which is advantageous regarding to the mitigation of the surface recombination velocity. Different influencing parameters of the process, as the process temperature or the initial roughness of the substrate, have been studied. The ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution has been used to study the mechanism of pyramid formation on (100) silicon by means of AFM and SEM. The proposed ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution has been applied to a solar cell process as <b>texturization</b> step. The influence of the Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 texturing on solar cell processing steps, as formation of phosphorous doped emitter layer, passivation, and deposition of thin layers, has been studied.

Two distinct approaches for surface <b>texturization</b> were studied. The first approach was photo-defined etching. For this approach, the research focus was to take advantage of Vall 6 ra's technique published in 1999, which demonstrated a high-contrast surface texture on p-type silicon created by photo-suppressed etching. Further theoretical consideration, however, led to a conclusion that diffusion of bromine in the electrolyte impacts the resolution achievable with Vallera's technique. Also, diffusion of photocarriers may impose an additional limitation on the resolution. The second approach studied was based on soft lithography. For this approach, a <b>texturization</b> process sequence that created a honeycomb texture with 20 ptm spacing on polished wafers at low cost and high throughput was developed. Novel techniques were incorporated in the process sequence, including surface wettability patterning by microfluidic lithography and selective condensation based on Raoult's law.

Laser processing is a promising method for <b>texturization</b> of multicrystalline silicon compared to conventional texturing methods applied in used technology of solar cells. Research limitations/implications: Laser processing introduce into the bulk of material some unwante...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective The {{objective}} of this experimental study was to evaluate, through bone densitometry, the performance of two factors that may influence the osseointegration process: nicotine and superficial <b>texturization</b> of the implants. Methods Nineteen New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were randomly distributed in two groups (test and control), in which 38 implants were placed. 19 machined implants (flat) 3. 75 mm of diameter by 6. 0 mm length were placed at the right tibia of the animals and, at the left tibia, 19 anodized implants (Vulcano(r)) with the same dimensions. Subcutaneous injections of nicotine 3 ml/day/kg, {{three times a day}} were administered in group, group control also received, three times a day, subcutaneous solution of NaCl (3 ml/day/kg), for 8 weeks. After this period, the densitometry analysis was performed. Results Considering the optical density (pixels), there were no statistical significant differences between the types of implants (p = 0. 135) as well as between groups (p= 0. 590). Conclusion The nicotine inside the experimental conditions used in this study and the superficial <b>texturization</b> of the implants indicated that they were not influencing bone density...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and <b>texturization</b> {{processes of}} fluorinated surfaces {{by means of}} atmospheric plasma are investigated and presented through an integrated study of both the plasma phase and the resulting material surface. Three methods enhancing the surface hydrophobicity up {{to the production of}} super-hydrophobic surfaces are evaluated: (i) the modification of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface, (ii) the plasma deposition of fluorinated coatings and (iii) the incorporation of nanoparticles into those fluorinated films. In all the approaches, the nature of the plasma gas appears to be a crucial parameter for the desired property. Although a higher etching of the PTFE surface can be obtained with a pure helium plasma, the <b>texturization</b> can only be created if O 2 is added to the plasma, which simultaneously decreases the total etching. The deposition of CxFy films by a dielectric barrier discharge leads to hydrophobic coatings with water contact angles (WCAs) of 115 °, but only the filamentary argon discharge induces higher WCAs. Finally, nanoparticles were deposited under the fluorinated layer to increase the surface roughness and therefore produce super-hydrophobic hybrid coatings characterized by the nonadherence of the water droplet at the surface.

40|$|Surface <b>texturization</b> is an {{effective}} way to enhance the absorption of light for optoelectronic devices but it also aggravates the surface recombination by enlarging the surface area. In order to evaluate the influence of texture structures on the surface recombination, {{an effective}} surface recombination velocity is defined which is assumed to have an equivalent recombination effect on a flat surface. Based on numerical and analytical calculation, the dependences of effective surface recombination on the pattern geometry, the surface recombination velocity, and the diffusion length are analyzed...|$|E
