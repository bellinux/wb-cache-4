5|$|Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by {{enthusiastic}} reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records {{and limited}} distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration {{took its toll}} on band relations: Bell left {{not long after the}} first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a <b>third</b> <b>album,</b> recorded in the Fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album.

Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was {{killed in a car accident}} at the age of 27.|$|E

5|$|Drake {{suffered}} from major depression, {{and this was}} often reflected in his lyrics.
