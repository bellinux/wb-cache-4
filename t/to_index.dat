5|$|Initially {{named as}} a species of Boletus by German mycologist Friedrich Rostkovius in 1844, the fungus was later {{transferred}} to Leccinum by Roy Watling in 1960. Synonyms resulting from transfer to different genera include: Krombholzia holopoda and K.holopus (both published by Albert Pilát in 1951); Krombholziella holopus (Josef Šutara, 1989); Trachypus holopus (Paul Konrad and André Maublanc, 1952), and Trachypus scaber f. holopus (Henri Romagnesi, 1939). Other synonyms, according <b>to</b> <b>Index</b> Fungorum, include Leccinum olivaceosum, described from France in 1994, and Leccinum aerugineum (1991). Leccinum holopus is classified in section Scabra of genus Leccinum, a grouping that includes Northern Hemisphere species associating exclusively with birch.|$|E

5|$|There are few data on comorbid {{conditions}}, {{but there}} are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect.

Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear <b>to</b> <b>index</b> a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the notion of}} steps in indexing and reveals that the document-centered approach <b>to</b> <b>indexing</b> is prevalent and argues that the document-centered approach is problematic because it blocks out context-dependent factors in the indexing process. A domain-centered approach <b>to</b> <b>indexing</b> is presented as an alternative and the paper discusses how this approach includes {{a broader range of}} analyses and how it requires a new set of actions from using this approach; analysis of the domain, users and indexers. The paper concludes that the two-step procedure <b>to</b> <b>indexing</b> is insufficient <b>to</b> explain the <b>indexing</b> process and suggests that the domain-centered approach offers a guide for indexers that can help them manage the complexity of indexing...|$|R
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used <b>to</b> <b>index</b> the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the species, placing it in Agaricus in 1774. Seven years later in 1781, Jean Bulliard described a species he called Agaricus necator and illustrated it in the first volume of his Herbier de la France; this name and the synonym Lactarius necator, resulting from Christian Hendrik Persoon's 1800 transfer to Lactarius, are both considered to refer to L.torminosus. Otto Kuntze, for his part chose to put it in Lactifluus, while Paul Kummer thought Galorrheus was the appropriate placement; until the recent resurrection of Lactifluus, both genera had been long considered to be unnecessary segregates of Lactarius. According <b>to</b> <b>Index</b> Fungorum, another synonym is Samuel Frederick Gray's Lactarius necans. Gray also gave the species its modern name when he transferred it to Lactarius in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} about whether Suillus cothurnatus represents a different species from S.salmonicolor. The online mycological taxonomy database MycoBank lists them as synonyms, contrary <b>to</b> <b>Index</b> Fungorum. In their 2000 monograph of North American boletes, Alan Bessette and colleagues list the two taxa separately, noting that the range of S.cothurnatus {{is difficult to determine}} because of confusion with S.salmonicolor. In a molecular analyses of Suillus phylogeny, based on the internal transcribed spacer, S.salmonicolor (as S.subluteus) and S.intermedius clustered together very closely, indicating a high degree of genetic similarity. These analyses were based on comparing the sequence differences in a single region of ribosomal DNA; more recent molecular analyses typically combine the analysis of several genes to increase the validity of inferences drawn.|$|E
