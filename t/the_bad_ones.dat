25|$|Tuonela was {{the land}} of dead. It was an {{underground}} home or city for all the dead people, not only the good or <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> It was a dark and lifeless place, where everybody slept forever. Still a brave shaman could travel to Tuonela in trance {{to ask for the}} forefathers' guidance. To travel to Tuonela, the soul had to cross the dark river of Tuonela. If the shaman had a proper reason, then a boat would come to take them over. Many times a shaman's soul had to trick the guards of Tuonela into believing that they were actually dead.|$|E
25|$|Brown was a leg-spinner in his youth, {{but turned}} to medium paced bowling after the war. He {{was able to}} turn or cut the ball with his large hands and was a wicket taker rather than a {{container}} of batsmen, but sometimes lost his line and length. As a pace bowler he was more accurate, was able to tie down even the best batsmen and proved adept at breaking solid partnerships. In particular {{he was able to}} dismiss the stonewalling Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. He still used his leg-spin when required by conditions or the frailties of the batsmen, sometimes mixing them up in the same over. His bucket hands made him a good catcher and he once caught and bowled Keith Miller in both innings of a Test, so the Australian all-rounder nicknamed him 'C and B'. As a batsman he stuck to the simple expedient of blocking the good balls and thumping <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones.</b> With his height, weight and strength he could strike the ball as hard as anyone and once hit a six into the Lord's Pavilion. His first-class centuries were noted for their plentiful boundaries and this was another reason why his was popular with the crowds.|$|E

25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones,</b> would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E
500|$|According to Steven Curtis Chapman, {{the idea}} for [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] {{came out of a}} song he had written called [...] "Find Me", which did not end up being {{included}} on This Moment. He reflected that he thought [...] "God was just saying 'I really just want you to be present in this moment - the good ones, <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> - all that'". [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] was written and produced by Chapman and Matt Bronlewee. It was mixed by F. Reid Shippen and mastered by Ted Jensen.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a love connection, where the protagonist makes bad decisions; [...] "I never was smart with love, I let <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> in and the good ones go". In the chorus, Robyn sings [...] "I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before/I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music noted that Robyn sings [...] "tough and knowing" [...] and [...] "pessimistically optimistic" [...] lines, but manages {{to make it sound}} romantic for the listener. Emma Gaedekke of Billboard commented on the lyrical content, saying, [...] "Robyn's heartfelt vocal turn {{prevents}} the backing music from overwhelming her story of a love connection found at the tail-end of heartbreak." ...|$|E

But when <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> was in <b>the</b> midst of the stream, the boy wished it to become small; and <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> fell into <b>the</b> water and was drowned, and the world was rid of him.|$|R
60|$|Once {{there he}} {{replaced}} {{the ball in}} the bag, and looked carefully round him. The door of <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One's</b> hut was open, and he saw that the ceiling was supported by great wooden beams, from which hung the bags of gold and the little bridge. He saw, too, <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> sitting in <b>the</b> midst of his treasures eating his dinner, and drinking something out of a horn. It was plain to the boy that he must invent some plan of getting <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> out of <b>the</b> way, or else he {{would never be able to}} steal the gold or the bridge.|$|R

Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police, who are likewise controlled by the cartel; all the while, Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are. Doggett remembers his son. The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales. Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories, even <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones,</b> [...] "as long as I remember the good.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tribes of}} Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed {{thousands}} of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia {{to assist the}} royalist cause. In addition to the Saudis and British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of Baathist Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime. The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said [...] "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying [...] "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser. We were brothers, but when I refused to become his stooge, he used Sallal against me. I will never stop fighting. I will never go into exile. Win or lose, my grave will be here".|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, TV Week's Miller {{reported}} that Breeds had filmed her final scenes and left Home and Away. Breeds told Miller {{that she could}} not discuss her departure because of her contract with the series. She added that [...] "Ruby is still very much alive, I'm not free of Ruby just yet". Two months later, the Daily Star's Susan Hill announced that Ruby decides to leave Summer Bay after she makes [...] "an emotional visit" [...] to her mother's grave. She then realises that she needs to move on from recent events and the only way she can do that is to leave the Bay. A spokesperson told Hill [...] "Ruby knows that to save her life she must leave for a fresh start. It's going to be emotional as she has so many good memories but <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> are all she can think of." [...] However, Ruby leaves Summer Bay after she confesses to tampering with the brakes of a car, which resulted in Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier) being seriously injured. Ruby regrets what she has done and hands herself in to the police after saying goodbye to Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Breeds thanked her fans on Twitter, saying [...] "Thank you. Such beautiful feedback. So sad that it's all over, but kind of relieved to let poor Ruby go and heal... And my Eyes.. Love you." ...|$|E

60|$|What {{should he}} do? Give horrible shrieks {{as if he}} were in pain? But <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> would not care whether he were murdered or not! Call him by his name? But <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> was very cunning, and would suspect some trick. He must try {{something}} better than that! Then suddenly an idea came to him, and he gave a little jump of joy. 'Oh, how stupid of me not to think of that before!' said he, and he wished with all his might that <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> should become very hungry--so hungry that he could not wait a moment for fresh food to be brought to him. And sure enough at that instant <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> called out to his servant, 'You did not bring food that would satisfy a sparrow Fetch some more at once, for I am perfectly starving.' Then, without giving the woman {{time to go to the}} larder, he got up from his chair, and rolled, staggering from hunger, towards the kitchen.|$|R

60|$|It seems {{strange that}} the good Emperors were often worse persecutors than <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones,</b> but the fact was that <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> let the people do as they pleased, {{as long as they}} did not offend them; while the good ones were trying to bring back what they read of in Livy's history, of plain living and high thinking, and shut their ears to knowing more of the Christians than that they were people who did not worship the gods. Moreover, Julius Trajanus, whom Nerva adopted, and who began to reign after him in 98, did not persecute actively, but there were laws in force against the Christians. When Pliny the younger was proprætor of the {{province}} of Pontica in Asia Minor, he wrote to ask the Emperor {{what to do about the}} Christians, telling him what he had been able to find out about them from two slave girls who had been tortured; namely, that they were wont to meet together at night or early morning, to sing together, and eat what he called a harmless social meal. Trajan answered that he need not try to hunt them out, but that, if they were brought before him, the law must take its course. In Rome, the chief refuge of the Christians was in the Catacombs, or quarries of tufa, from which the city was chiefly built, and which were hollowed out in long galleries. Slaves and convicts worked them, and they were thus made known to the Christians, who buried their dead in places hollowed at the sides, used the galleries for their churches, and often hid there when there was search made for them.|$|E
