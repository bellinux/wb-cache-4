5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E
5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E
25|$|The Cabinet further {{considered}} {{the use of}} force on 24 October. On 25 October Eden told the Cabinet that Israel would attack Egypt after all, but did not <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> secret Sevres Protocol. Cabinet minutes record that Macleod was doubtful about {{the use of force}} (as were Monckton and Heathcoat Amory) {{because of the lack of}} clear UN authority and the risk of antagonising the USA. However, they did not formally dissent from the Cabinet decision to invade if Israel attacked Egypt (the Cabinet were deceived about the extent to which such an attack had already been secretly agreed – “collusion” – by Eden and Selwyn Lloyd).|$|E

25|$|In 1864, Hubbard {{became an}} Anglican deaconess and became {{active in the}} deaconess {{movement}} after a friend introduced her to the society. The movement, which had been present in the Anglican church since 1850, focused on providing community life for women and training them work with the poor as nurses or teachers. She began serving with the society and organized a number of gatherings. In 1871, she published a pamphlet entitled Anglican Deaconesses; or Is There No Place for Women in the Parochial System? This work contained descriptions of meetings that she had with church leaders, including Harold Browne. She also met with potential donors to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> movement. She also published a letter in John Bull detailing {{the aims of the}} movement. However, she later became discouraged by the slow pace of growth that came to characterise the movement.

500|$|In [...] "We Need To Talk About Kevin", Dean escapes Purgatory {{with the}} help of the vampire Benny, but Castiel is not with him. He later tells Sam that things got hairy near the end and that Castiel didn't make it, that he [...] "let go". While Dean doesn't elaborate, he is clearly {{affected}} by this. In a flashback scene, Dean is shown looking for Castiel in Purgatory, interrogating a vampire for his location. As a result, he meets Benny and only agrees to Benny's deal to get out if they find Castiel first and help him escape too. Castiel appears in flashbacks in the following episode, where he reveals that he fled Dean to keep him safe from the Leviathans and other monsters that are angry at Castiel, but Dean refuses to leave Purgatory without Castiel. When talking with another angel at an auction for the second Word of God tablet, Dean again states that Castiel did not make it out of Purgatory. He later escapes with the aid of an army of angels sent to rescue him – having initially remained behind as penance for his actions to stop a duo of Leviathans that were trying to attack Dean and Benny as they left Purgatory – but the other angels not only erase his memory that they were responsible for his escape, but also erase his memory of their subsequent 'check-ins' to discuss the Winchesters' actions, with Castiel forced to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Winchesters' progress in the search for the tablet. Apparently back to full power, Castiel helps the Winchesters save Kevin from Crowley – who has been abducting future Prophets to try to find another means of reading the Word of God tablet – and destroy the tablet to prevent Crowley using it, retaining half of the tablet while Crowley flees with the other half. Afterwards, in [...] "Hunteri Heroici", Castiel cuts off his ability to listen into the other angels and decides to become a full-time hunter to avoid facing the other angels about what he has done. Castiel proves instrumental in solving the case, using his abilities to enter the mind of a man with reality warping powers, allowing Sam to bring him back to reality with a speech about not running from it. Later, at the request of the man, Fred, Castiel strips him of his powers so he is no longer a danger to anyone though it leaves him mentally damaged. Castiel, having listened to Sam's speech about running from reality as well as Fred, decides to return to Heaven to try to make up for what he did, but is forbidden by Naomi, the angel who ordered his rescue. Instead, Castiel stays to watch out for Fred for a while, but accepts that he can no longer run from what he has done.|$|E

Maimonides explained that [...] sought to cure humanity of such afflictions.
