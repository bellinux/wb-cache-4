5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial <b>test</b> <b>phase,</b> compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasingly}} use {{of electronic}} equipment in {{various aspects of}} modern life has lead to implementation of numerous <b>testing</b> <b>phases</b> during the design, assessment, and manufacture of electronic equipment. Even though <b>testing</b> <b>phases</b> of electronic equipment look for design errors, fabrication errors, and fabrication defects during manufacturing process, post manufacturing <b>testing</b> <b>phases</b> are ineffective or inexistent for electronic equipment. Therefore, an additional post manufacturing <b>testing</b> <b>phase</b> is needed to guarantee safe operation and reliability of electronic equipment during successive operations. ^ This research presents the exploratory work required for implementing a post manufacturing <b>testing</b> <b>phase.</b> Post manufacturing <b>testing</b> <b>phase</b> consists in analyzing the power consumption of a Personal Computer (PC) at boot up to correlate hardware computation with power consumption. Correlation between hardware computation and power consumption was used to establish the determinism of the power signature of electronics for health monitoring from run-to-run and from system-to-system on a total of 10 PCs. The motivation {{of this research is}} to identify emerging electronic failures to reduce expenses associated to field failures or to safeguard of human lives. ...|$|R
50|$|NRT {{is applied}} during each {{software}} release <b>testing</b> <b>phase,</b> {{at the final}} stage during integration testing, right before the execution of system testing, and after the module testing (or unit <b>testing)</b> <b>phase.</b> In the module <b>testing</b> <b>phase,</b> single software modules are evaluated individually, which allows the identification of elementary errors like overflow, underflow, round-off, as well as discrepancies between algorithm model simulation results and the signals coming from the engine management system (EMS). The integration <b>testing</b> <b>phase,</b> performed afterwards, aims to verify whether the tested module is correctly integrated in the overall software system. Finally, functional testing (also called validation testing) is applied to validate the algorithms concerning functional requirements. This stage is usually performed after the calibration phase and characterizes an overall system testing, concluding the new software <b>testing</b> <b>phase,</b> and allowing, therefore, its release.|$|R

40|$|A large {{percentage}} of the cost of rework can be avoided by finding more faults earlier in a software test process. Therefore, determination of which software <b>test</b> <b>phases</b> to focus improvement work on has considerable industrial interest. We evaluate a number of prediction techniques for predicting the number of faults slipping through to unit, function, integration, and system <b>test</b> <b>phases</b> of a large industrial project. The objective is to quantify improvement potential in different <b>test</b> <b>phases</b> by striving toward finding the faults in the right phase. The results show that a range of techniques are found to be useful in predicting the number of faults slipping through to the four test phases; however, the group of search-based techniques (genetic programming, gene expression programming, artificial immune recognition system, and particle swarm optimization-based artificial neural network) consistently give better predictions, having a representation at all of the <b>test</b> <b>phases.</b> Human predictions are consistently better at two of the four <b>test</b> <b>phases.</b> We conclude that the human predictions regarding the number of faults slipping through to various <b>test</b> <b>phases</b> can be well supported by the use of search-based techniques. A combination of human and an automated search mechanism (such as any of the search-based techniques) has the potential to provide improved prediction results...|$|R

25|$|To {{determine}} if infants were {{picking up on}} the statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword {{made up of the}} same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the <b>test</b> <b>phase</b> listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as dapiku and tilado that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable ku never followed the syllable pi.|$|E
25|$|Together {{these studies}} suggest that infants are able to extract a {{substantial}} amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language. Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or {{in the middle of the}} sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings during the <b>test</b> <b>phase.</b> This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying those rules to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a short delay.|$|E

25|$|The AU-24A Stallion had {{the same}} side-mounted gun, as well as five underwing and {{fuselage}} stations. In January 1972, the second <b>test</b> <b>phase</b> for the AU-24A began at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. The initial aircraft used, 72-1319, was leased from Helio and retained its civilian configuration, but it allowed basic flight testing to begin. The combat evaluation of the Credible Chase program was canceled in February 1972, but the initial (stateside) evaluation was kept on the program schedule. The first combat equipped AU-24A was delivered on 4 March 1972, and operational test and evaluation began on 17 March, but was delayed after a review of contractor quality control began on 3 April. On 10 April, the review imposed a number of flight restrictions on the AU-24A limiting maximum airspeed, dive and bank angles, and all instrument, weather and night test flights. The OT of the AU-24A was officially started over on 22 April, and by 3 May, the aircraft was again in trouble. This time the problem was a dynamic instability during flight. The problems were resolved by 12 May, and the test program continued until completion on 22 May. Starting on 28 June, the AU-24As were flown to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. for storage. The Credible Chase program was canceled and no AU-24A was delivered to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} is {{a description of a}} classic goal devaluation experiment (from a Scientific American MIND guest blog post called [...] ) which demonstrates the difference between goal-directed and habitual behavior: A series of elegant experiments conducted by Anthony Dickinson and colleagues in the early 1980s at the University of Cambridge in England clearly exposes the behavioral differences between goal-directed and habitual processes. Basically, in the training phase, a rat was trained to press a lever in order to receive some food. Then, in a second phase, the rat was placed in a different cage without a lever and was given the food, but it was made ill whenever it ate the food. This caused the rat to [...] "devalue" [...] the food, because it associated the food with being ill, without directly associating the action of pressing the lever with being ill. Finally, in the <b>test</b> <b>phase,</b> the rat was placed in the original cage with the lever. (To prevent additional learning, no food was delivered in the <b>test</b> <b>phase.)</b> Rats that had undergone an extensive training phase continued to press the lever in the <b>test</b> <b>phase</b> even though the food was devalued; their behavior was called habitual. Rats that had undergone a moderate training phase did not, and their behavior was called goal-directed. … [...] oal-directed behavior is explained by the rat using an explicit prediction of the consequence, or outcome, of an action to select that action. If the rat wants the food, it presses the lever, because it predicts that pressing the lever will deliver the food. If the food has been devalued, the rat will not press the lever. Habitual behavior is explained by a strong association between an action and the situation from which the action was executed. The rat presses the lever when it sees the lever, not because of the predicted outcome..|$|E
