5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the danger from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of <b>the</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff, Northern Command in December 1967. By 1969 {{a large percentage}} of Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines, including significant quantities of M16 anti-personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier minefield at Dat Do. Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded, a figure which constituted approximately 11 percent of those killed during the war. These losses increasingly became a political issue as support for the war in Australia waned, and <b>the</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision was later criticised, both within the military and in the media. As the controversy surrounding the minefield grew, in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board, positions he held until 1972. Meanwhile, after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the minefield had been sound, it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian mistakes of the war. By August 1969 work had begun to remove the minefield.|$|E

40|$|In {{the studies}} {{reported}} so far on dendrimer-mediated catalysis, <b>the</b> <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catalytic units were studied and compared primarily across the generations. In {{order to identify}} <b>the</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> an individual catalytic unit with respect to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> such units present within a given generation, a series of catalysts were prepared within a generation. Dendrimers incorporated with phosphinemetal complexes were chosen for the study {{and as many as}} 11 catalysts within three generations were synthesized. The C-C bond-forming reactions, namely, the Heck and the Suzuki coupling reactions, were then selected to study <b>the</b> catalytic efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series <b>of</b> partially and fully phosphine-metal complex functionalized dendrimers. <b>The</b> <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> cinnamate and biphenyl. catalyzed by the dendritic catalysts, were compared. The comparative analyses show that an individual catalytic site is far more effective in its catalytic activity when presented in multiple numbers, i. e., in a multivalent dendritic system, than as a single unit within the same generation, i. e., in a monovalent dendritic system. The study identifies <b>the</b> beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multivalent presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catalytic moieties, both within and across the dendrimer generations...|$|R
