40|$|In 87 {{children}} aged 2 - 9 yr, oral droperidol and oral droperidol plus diazepam were compared as premedicants {{in a controlled}} double-blind clinical trial. Atropine was given orally to all the patients. Droperidol was well absorbed and produced good sedation, associated with a low incidence of vomiting after operation. Droperidol plus diazepam {{did not appear to}} offer any advantage over droperidol alone. Anxiety and extrapyramidal effects were not observed and may have been obviated by the addition of atropine. Droperidol syrup was noted to be more palatable than other oral premedicants in use. Although premedication with droperidol (Droleptan) i. m. has been used extensively, comparatively little is known of its efficacy when given orally. A previous trial of oral triclofos (<b>trichloroethyl</b> <b>phosphate)</b> and diazepam (Valium) in this hospital (Boyd and Manford, 1973) showed a high incidence of vomiting after operation. Trimeprazine (Vallergan) has been noted to cause prolonged recovery and drowsiness after anaesthesia and diazepam has a poor anti-salivary action. Both triclofos and trimeprazine may be unpalatable to children; the former because it is too sweet and the latter because of its bitter taste. Therefore, the sedative, anti-emetic and anti-salivary actions of droperidol were thought to merit a trial of the drug as an oral premedicant in children. At the same time it was decided to combine droperidol with diazepam to determine if the two drugs together would be superior to droperidol alone, particularly with regard to possible extrapyramidal symptoms and anxiety. It was intended to compare {{the results of this study}} with the results of the trial of oral triclofos and diazepam carried out in this hospital 3 years previously. METHOD The double-bund trial was restricted to {{children aged}} from 2 to 9 yr and weighing less than 29 kg. The majority of the patients were undergoing otolaryngological procedures, but some were under-going minor orthopaedic and general surgical operations...|$|E
