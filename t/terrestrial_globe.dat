5|$|Only six Molyneux globes {{are known}} to exist today, two {{terrestrial}} globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe,</b> but it {{is believed to have}} been destroyed during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library, while a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.|$|E

5|$|The <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> is {{significant}} in conjecturing that North America {{is separated from}} Asia, unlike the globe of Monachus. Another feature, the shape Mercator ascribed to Beach and Maletur, later gave rise to speculation that the north coast of Australia had been visited in the early sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{volume of the}} greatly {{expanded}} version of his book The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1599), Hakluyt published what is known today as the Wright–Molyneux Map. Created by Edward Wright and based on Molyneux's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe,</b> {{it was the first}} map to use Wright's improvements on Mercator's projection.|$|E
5|$|Having, it is believed, {{purchased}} the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius {{was granted a}} ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe.</b> In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis. On 31 October 1598, despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years. He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown {{by a number of}} legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.|$|E
5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were {{inherited}} {{from the collection of}} William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), a pioneer of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III. Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> was destroyed during World War II.|$|E
50|$|No <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes</b> from Antiquity or the Middle Ages have survived. An {{example of}} a {{surviving}} celestial globe {{is part of a}} Hellenistic sculpture, called the Farnese Atlas, surviving in a 2nd-century AD Roman copy in the Naples Archaeological Museum, Italy.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} surviving maps on {{the projection}} appear as woodcut drawings of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes</b> of 1509 (anonymous), 1533 and 1551 (Johannes Schöner), and 1524 and 1551 (Apian). These were crude. A highly refined map designed by Renaissance polymath Albrecht Dürer and executed by Johannes Stabius appeared in 1515.|$|R
50|$|In 1652, Moxon visited Amsterdam and {{commissioned}} the engraving of globe-printing plates, {{and by the}} end of the year was selling large celestial and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes</b> in a new business venture. He specialized in the printing of maps and charts, and in the production of globes, and mathematical instruments made of paper.|$|R
5|$|In {{making his}} {{terrestrial}} globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea) and pilots (navigational handbooks). He {{is known to}} have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590. He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians. It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe.</b> Raleigh came by the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Caspar Vopel (1511-1561) was a German {{cartographer}} and instrument maker. Born in Medebach, {{he studied}} mathematics and {{medicine at the}} University of Cologne in 1526-1529. He taught mathematics at the Gymnasium of Cologne {{and in the early}} 1530s established a workshop to produce celestial and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes,</b> armillary spheres, sundials, quadrants and astrolabes. In 1545 he began to prepare maps and atlases. Vopel is sometimes credited with the promotion of the ancient asterism Coma Berenices to constellation status.|$|R
50|$|In 1813, {{he opened}} the first {{geographic}} globe factory in the US and sold his initial 13 inch globe for $50. The Wilson globes were widely successful, and Wilson expanded to production of sets of celestial and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes</b> in various sizes, materials and prices, including printed Papier-mâché, enabling them to be purchased inexpensively for use in schools and homes. Wilson increased his production to meet demand, and in partnership with his sons he opened a second factory in Albany, New York.|$|R
5000|$|Gilles and Didier Robert De Vaugondy {{produced}} their {{maps and}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes</b> working together as father and son. Globes {{of a variety}} of sizes were made by gluing copperplate-printed gores on a plaster-finished papier-mache core, a complicated and expensive manufacturing process, employing several specialists. In some cases it is uncertain whether Gilles or Didier made a given map. Gilles often signed maps as [...] "M.Robert", while Didier commonly signed his maps as [...] "Robert de Vaugondy", or added [...] "fils" [...] or [...] "filio" [...] after his name.|$|R

25|$|In the box T are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes {{come out}} at V and U; either {{of which may be}} turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turn backward, the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe,</b> with its horizon and {{celestial}} meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} French geographers and mapmakers of {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century. Successor to Nicolas Sanson (1600 - 1667), Robert de Vaugondy (1686 - 1766), and Rigobert Bonne (1727 - 1794), whose atlases he reprinted. Also taught geography. In addition to maps and globes, his works include a treatise on the use of the sphere and celestial and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes.</b> In the treatise, he illustrates both the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems, as well as listing all the ancient and modern constellations. His son Félix Delamarche (18th century - 1st half 19th century) continued his work.|$|R

The front panel of the IMP instrument served as the structural support for all other components; {{it was made of}} thick, machined aluminum alloy with structural protrusions. The mechanical components were made of brass, steel and aluminum; the globe itself was made of aluminum covered with printed paper, a typical technique for the manufacture of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes.</b> The enclosing cover was made of a sheet of aluminum alloy cut and soldered to shape.|$|R

The history of ancient geography should include the spiritual and intellectual practices linked with maps and globes and explore the relationship between science and philosophy.

500|$|The {{celestial}} globe is dated 1592, but the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> bears the year 1603 {{and is the}} only example of its kind. Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 for a purchaser in England, perhaps the Middle Temple itself. The {{celestial globe}} was made from the original 1592 printing plates, while the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> was produced using revised plates redated to 1603. The Middle Temple <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> differs from the Petworth House globe of 1592 by incorporating Raleigh's discoveries in Guiana and adding new place-names in Brazil, Peru and Africa, as well as an island marked [...] "Corea" [...] off the coast of China. The most extensive revision altered the Northeast Passage to take account of discoveries made on Willem Barentsz's third voyage to Novaya Zemlya in 1596. It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux's globe were completed by 1597, because no discoveries after that year are included. It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597. For instance, if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh's map of Guiana, Molyneux was the most likely source. Unlike the Petworth House globe, the Middle Temple globes are heavily varnished. The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton; they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen & Cubitts, Ltd. during maintenance work in 1930.|$|E
500|$|The {{mathematician}} and cartographer Edward Wright assisted Molyneux in plotting coastlines on the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> {{and translated}} {{some of the}} legends into Latin. On 10 April 1591, the astrologer and physician Simon Forman visited Molyneux's workshop and {{taught him how to}} find longitude. It appears that after Molyneux had prepared the manuscript gores (the flat map segments attached to the globes), he had them printed by the celebrated Flemish engraver and cartographer Jodocus Hondius, who lived in London between 1584 and 1593 to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. This can be deduced from the phrase [...] "Iodocus Hon: / dius Flan. sc. / 1592" [...] that appears on the celestial globe along with Sanderson's coat of arms and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592. Molyneux's own name is recorded on the Middle Temple <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globe</b> in the phrase [...] "Emerius Mulleneux Angl.' / sumptibus Gulielmi— / Sandersoni Londinē: / sis descripsit" [...] ("Emery Molyneux of England, at the expense of William Sanderson of London, described this").|$|E

50|$|An {{analemma}} can {{be traced}} by plotting {{the position of the}} Sun as viewed from a fixed position on Earth at the same clock time every day for an entire year, or by plotting a graph of the Sun's declination against the equation of time. The resulting curve resembles a long, slender figure-eight with one lobe much larger than the other. This curve is commonly printed on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>globes,</b> usually in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the only large tropical region with very little land. It is possible, though challenging, to photograph the analemma, by leaving the camera in a fixed position for an entire year and snapping images on 24-hour intervals (or some multiple thereof); see section below.|$|R
