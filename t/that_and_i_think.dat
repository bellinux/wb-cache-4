There is no evidence of <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we have to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E
500|$|Bangerz is {{primarily}} a pop album, which also integrates elements of hip hop, synthpop, and country music. During an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on October 10, host Ellen DeGeneres asked Cyrus if the record was inspired by her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, to which she replied [...] "the whole album {{is a story of}} <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it says that starting with [...] "Adore You" [...] and ending with [...] "Someone Else" ..... I think I knew more intuitively where my life was going than I actually thought I did at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Nazi pledges of nondiscrimination {{in sports}} proved {{inconsistent}} with their actions, {{such as the}} expulsion of Jews from sports clubs, and in September 1934, Brundage sailed for Germany to see for himself. He met with government officials and others, although he {{was not allowed to}} meet with Jewish sports leaders alone. When he returned, he reported, [...] "I was given positive assurance in writing... {{that there will be no}} discrimination against Jews. You can't ask more than <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the guarantee will be fulfilled." [...] Brundage's trip only increased the controversy over the question of US participation, with New York Congressman Emanuel Celler stating that Brundage [...] "had prejudged the situation before he sailed from America". Nevertheless, on September 26, 1934, after hearing a report from Brundage on conditions in Germany, the AOC voted to send a US team to Berlin.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{marks the}} return of American actress Megan Dodds, who first {{appeared}} {{in a handful of}} scenes in the first episode of the first series. The producers enjoyed the actress' company, and wanted her to return where the character would appear more often and developed throughout the second series. Jenny Agutter returns as Tessa Philips; it allows the audience to see what happens to her since her sacking in the first series finale. The episode introduces new regular character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker. The producers needed another [...] "interesting, strong" [...] member of the team following Tessa's departure. The character also came from GCHQ in the series; the producers were aware that the organisation employs 70,000 people, and the producers did not want to ignore this aspect of British intelligence gathering. Describing Walker's casting, producer Jane Featherstone recalled [...] "Nicola is extraordinary in it. I think she's completely brilliant. And she's developed <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> once Nicola became that role that writers had just loved writing for that part, and she's really made it her own." [...] The character was created by Brenton. Her introduction depicted her as clumsy, mirroring the writer.|$|E

I think I knew more intuitively where my life was going than I actually thought I did at the time." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today thought of [...] "Someone Else" [...] as a more [...] "reflective" [...] lyrical offering from its parent record, while Lipshutz interpreted the track to detail the departure of Cyrus' [...] "past baggage" [...] and the introduction of [...] "her new self". Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer assumed that the song was designed to address her transition from her innocent Hannah Montana image and then-recent breakup with fiance Liam Hemsworth; from a production standpoint, he jokingly referenced Cyrus' earlier single [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] when mentioning that [...] " [...] her party and she can do what she wants", in regards to the increasingly diverse genres she had begun experimenting with. Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood opined that it spoke of the [...] "psychic damage" [...] that comes with prosperity in the entertainment industry. Based on the line [...] "if you're looking for love know that love don't live here anymore" [...] from the refrain, David Drake and David Bry from Complex opined that Cyrus' track was [...] "thematically" [...] similar to [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] by Rose Royce.|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2007 {{interview}} with the Financial Times, Calderón said, [...] "We have received very encouraging results. In the state of Michoacán, for example, the murder rate has fallen almost 40 percent compared with the average {{over the last six}} months. People's support in the regions where we are operating has grown, and that has been very important. Opinion polls have confirmed <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we have made it clear to everyone that this issue is a priority for us".|$|E

2500|$|As for Hopkins, he {{was upset}} with the {{official}} decision {{and said that he}} was robbed of a clear points win. Hopkins said, [...] "I just really feel like I took the guy to school. I feel like I made him fight my fight, not his. I wanted him to run into my shots. I think I made him do <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I made it look pretty easy.

2500|$|In 1999, in a {{discussion}} forum, Lee Kuan Yew was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied: [...] "Yes, I think so, {{over a long period}} of time, and selectively. We must not make an error. If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know his background. I'm saying these things because they are real, and if I don't think <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy.|$|E

5000|$|During a June 9, 2009 interview, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the new {{chairman}} of GM, said, [...] "I don’t know anything about cars ...

2500|$|After the game, Allen {{was cited}} {{as one of}} the main reasons for Duke's {{comeback}} and win by commentators. Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying, [...] "We were kind of dead in the water. We were nine points down and Grayson just put us on his back." [...] Commenting on his team's loss, Bo Ryan credited Duke's physical defense saying [...] "There was more body contact in this game than any game we played all year, and I just feel sorry for my guys that all of the sudden a game was like <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're struggling with that a little bit." [...] Ryan, however, also blamed the officials, citing the disparity in fouls called during the second half (Wisconsin's 13 to Duke's 6) and the controversial replay review near the end of the game.|$|E
2500|$|For Series 10, Capaldi {{described}} his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' {{than the previous}} season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following this Doctor, you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi {{expressed in terms of}} his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker. So I think that makes for a very interesting character.' Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. So I think he becomes slightly worried that he’s swept someone else up into his adventures without quite preparing them.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2014, {{when talking}} about the series in {{comparison}} to the 2003 film, Ted Sarandos said, [...] "The series will not be afraid to go darker than the film did. What we love about this particular set of heroes is that they're a little more down to Earth. Costume wise and also in that these are gritty crime stories, more in the streets than in the clouds." [...] Elaborating on this, DeKnight said, [...] "It is a little grittier and edgier than Marvel has gone before, but we're not looking to push it to extreme graphic violence, gratuitous nudity or anything like that. The story does not require <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> [...] would suffer if you pushed it that far." [...] Marvel Television head and executive producer Loeb later stated that, [...] "There aren't going to be people flying through the sky; there are no magic hammers. We've always approached this as a crime drama first, superhero show second." [...] DeKnight took inspiration from The French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon, and Taxi Driver, and stated that [...] "we would rather lean toward The Wire than what's considered a classic superhero television show." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her eyes {{expressed}} more sympathy {{than she}} put into her voice. [...] "I {{see what you}} mean; but, believe me, I had not thought of her in just <b>that</b> light, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you're quite wrong about my aunt. She is really very fond of your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The talk {{of white}} men is wholly lacking in dignity,' said the lama, who judged only by tone.

"If {{you look}} at the white petals you'll see that they sparkle like marble, and go winding a long way down {{to the middle of the}} flower where it grows sort of rosy; and in among the small, curly leaves, like fringed curtains, you can see the little green fairy sitting all alone. Your mother showed me <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is very pretty. I call it a 'fairy,' but it is really where the seeds are hidden and the sweet smell comes from." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{in a way}} I am worrying," [...] {{he confessed}} simply. [...] "Not about the storm itself.

In the meantime, I think that {{what has happened to}} me is this. I have arrived just at that time of life when a man takes stock of himself and his doings, criticises his own past and wonders whether the things he has proposed doing in the future are worth while." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Kingdom fidgeted, {{but before}} she could think of a {{satisfactory}} reply Bella came to the door and asked to speak to her for a moment. Profiting by her absence, Mr. Hardy leaned towards Miss Nugent, and in a low voice expressed his sorrow at the mishap to her father and his firm conviction that everything that could be thought of for that unfortunate mariner's comfort would be done. [...] "Our fathers will probably come back good friends," [...] he concluded. [...] "There is nothing would give me more pleasure than <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that we had better begin and set them a good example." ...|$|E
