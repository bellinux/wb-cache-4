25|$|Howitzers {{were best}} suited for {{long-range}} fire. When howitzers and cannons were mixed in artillery batteries, the howitzers tended to be used at the shorter ranges where cannons were more effective. This led to a higher expenditure of ammunition. While artillery could be very destructive, it also exercised a psychological effect. Soldiers were frightened of long range artillery fire to which their short-ranged muskets could not respond. If possible, the British deployed their soldiers behind crests to minimize losses from artillery fire, but all other nations usually deployed their troops in the open. At close ranges, the gunners fired canister shot, an anti-personnel weapon. A canister round spewed a load of musket balls <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> when fired. Normally, howitzers fired shells at their targets. Unlike cannons which fired on a more flat trajectory, howitzers were designed to throw a shell on an arching trajectory.|$|E
25|$|The {{cannonball}} or {{round shot}} was the projectile most often used. Both direct and ricochet fire {{could be used}} to hit a target. Round shot was most effective when used against formed troops in column and was somewhat less effective against troops in line. Soldiers were frightened of long range artillery fire because their short-ranged muskets could not retaliate against the gunners. The British deployed their soldiers on reverse slopes when possible to avoid losses from artillery fire, but all other nations generally arrayed their soldiers in the open. However, when under a severe bombardment by 50 Austrian guns at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the French Imperial Guard redeployed from a 3-deep line to a 1-deep line to minimize losses and keep the appearance of a solid front. At closer ranges, the gunners switched to canister, an anti-personnel weapon. When canister was fired, its load of musket balls flew <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> while spreading out.|$|E

40|$|Many {{political}} communications {{are negative}} in nature, {{but not much}} is known of the situations in which such communications are more damaging to <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> political candidate We hypothesized and experimentally demonstrated that (a) negative political communications are more successful in damagmg overall voter attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> candidate than positive communica-tions are in raising such attitudes, (b) such negative communications are more effective in changing those beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> candidate that concern character (likability and trustworthiness) than in modifying competence (exper-tise-related) beliefs, and (c) these attitude-changing effects are greater when vot-ers form their overall attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> candidate more {{on the basis of}} character beliefs than competence ones. Implications of these results are discussed for public policy and for attitude theory. Because political advertising is undoubtedly a significant element in the total political process (Jamieson, 1984), {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms by which consumers process political advertising is clearly worth seeking in part because it may add to our knowledge about advertising in general. One very visible characteristic of political advertising is that it is increasingly nega-tive in nature: It has been estimated that between 30 % and 50 % of all advertis-ing in past political campaigns was negative (Taylor, 1986). Such negative advertisements deal with an opponent’s frailties rather than the candidate’s own views toward public issues. In other words, although a candidate using...|$|R
25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Sergei Khrushchev {{wrote about}} the {{experience}} of his father, Nikita Khrushchev, in the incident. He described how Mentyukov attempted to intercept the U-2, but failed to gain visual contact. Major Mikhail Voronov, in control of a battery of anti-aircraft missiles, fired three SA-2s at the radar contact but only one ignited. It quickly rose <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and exploded in the air behind the U-2 but near enough to violently shake the aircraft, tearing off its long wings. At a lower altitude, Powers {{climbed out of the}} falling fuselage and parachuted to the ground. Uncertainty about the initial shootdown success resulted in 13 further anti-aircraft missiles being fired by neighboring batteries, but the later missiles only hit a pursuing MiG-19 piloted by Sr. Lt. Sergei Safronov, mortally wounding him. This account of the events that occurred during the mission match the details that were given to the CIA by Gary Powers. According to Powers, a missile exploded behind him and after this occurred his U-2 began to nosedive. It is at this point that Powers began to make all of the preparations to eject. Powers landed safely and tried to hide himself in the Russian countryside until he could get help. His attempts to do this failed and he was captured. Sergei Safronov was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner.|$|E

500|$|With the {{escalating}} situation in Southeast Asia, 28 B-52Fs were fitted with external racks for 24x 750lb (340kg) bombs under project South Bay in June 1964; an additional 46 aircraft received similar modifications under project Sun Bath. In March 1965, the United States commenced Operation Rolling Thunder. The first combat mission, Operation Arc Light, was flown by B-52Fs on 18 June 1965, when 30 bombers of the 9th and 441st Bombardment Squadrons struck a communist stronghold near the Bến Cát District in South Vietnam. The {{first wave of}} bombers arrived too early at a designated rendezvous point, and while maneuvering to maintain station, two B-52s collided, {{which resulted in the}} loss of both bombers and eight crewmen. The remaining bombers, minus one more that turned back due to mechanical problems, continued <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> Twenty-seven Stratofortresses dropped on a one-mile by two-mile target box from between 19,000 and 22,000feet, a little more than 50% of the bombs falling within the target zone. The force returned to Andersen AFB except for one bomber with electrical problems that recovered to Clark AFB, the mission having lasted 13 hours. Post-strike assessment by teams of South Vietnamese troops with American advisors found evidence that the Viet Cong had departed the area before the raid, and it was suspected that infiltration of the south's forces may have tipped off the north because of the South Vietnamese Army troops involved in the post-strike inspection.|$|E
