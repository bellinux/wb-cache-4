25|$|At the Domesday {{survey the}} village was known as Lothuwistoft and was {{relatively}} small {{with a population of}} around 16households comprising, in 1086, three families, ten smallholders and three slaves. The manor formed part of the king's holding within the Hundred of Lothingland and was worth about four geld in tax income. Roger Bigod was the <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the village. The village of Akethorpe may have been located close to Lowestoft.|$|E
25|$|Cornwall was {{included}} in the survey, initiated by William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, which became known as the Domesday Book, where it is included as being part of the Norman king's new domain. Cornwall was unusual as Domesday records no Saxon burh; a burh (borough) was the Saxons' centre of legal and administrative power. Moreover, nearly all land was held by one person, William's half-brother Robert of Mortain, who may have been the first Norman to bear the title Earl of Cornwall. He held his Cornish lands not as a <b>Tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> of the King, {{as was the case with}} other landowners, but as de facto Viceroy.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of late Iron Age and Roman settlement at Inns Court and Filwood Park, which lie within Knowle West. In 1086, the area that is now Knowle West was assessed by the Domesday survey as part of Knowle in the hundred of Hartcliffe. The survey shows Knowle as being under the lordship of Eadnoth the Constable who had 30 holdings in Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire before the Norman conquest. After the conquest, Knowle {{became part of the}} holdings of Osbern Giffard, who was lord, or <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> of holdings throughout Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset. The Domesday Book shows Knowle as having eleven households, three ploughlands, one cob (small horse), eight cattle, twenty five pigs, a meadow of , pasture of [...] and a woodland area of [...] by [...] For taxation purposes, the whole was assessed at two geld units. Filwood Park, {{in the southern part of}} the area was part of the parish of Whitchurch until incorporated into Bristol in 1930. In Anglo-Saxon times Filwood Chase was part of the royal hunting estate known as Kingswood Forest, which encompassed a large area around Bristol.|$|E
50|$|At the Domesday {{survey of}} 1086 {{the village is}} named as Nordhalla or Nordhals and is {{recorded}} as being a medium-sized settlement with 13 households of freemen or smallholders. The land was held by William son of Reginald from William of Warenne although other <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> included the King and Roger Bigot.|$|R
50|$|Nothing in the {{statutes}} addressed the King's rights, and <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> {{of the crown}} continued to need royal licence to alienate their estates. On the contrary, {{at the time the}} right of alienation by substitution was being set in Statute, the King's claim to restrain any alienation by his tenants was strengthened.|$|R
5000|$|If {{any of my}} earls, barons {{or other}} <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> die, his heir shall not redeem his land {{as he did in}} the time of my brother (i.e. William II of England), but shall take it up with a just and lawful relief. The men of my barons shall take up (relevabunt) their lands from their lords with a just and lawful relief.|$|R
2500|$|Leeds parish {{is thought}} to have {{developed}} from a large British multiple estate which, under subsequent Anglo-Saxon occupation was further sub divided into smaller land holdings. The ancient estate straddled the wapentakes of Morley and Skyrack, encompassing Leeds, Headingley, Allerton, Gipton, Bramley, Armley, Farnley, Beeston and Ristone (Wortley). Leeds parish in Skyrack was {{the most important of these}} holdings. Leeds was then further sub divided so that when the first dependable historical record about Leeds (as [...] "Ledes") [...] was written in the Domesday book of 1086, it was recorded as having comprised seven small manors in the days of Edward the Confessor. At the time of the Norman conquest, Leeds was evidently a purely agricultural domain, of about [...] in extent. It was divided into seven manors, held by as many thanes; they possessed six ploughs; there was a priest, and a church, and a mill: its taxable value was six pounds. When the Domesday records were made, it had slightly increased in value; the seven thanes had been replaced by twenty-seven villains, four sokemen, and four bordars. The villains were what we should now call day-labourers: the soke or soc men were persons of various degrees, from small owners under a greater lord, to mere husbandmen: the bordars are considered by most specialists in Domesday terminology to have been mere drudges, hewers of wood, drawers of water. The mill, when this survey [...] was made, was worth four shillings. There were [...] of meadow. The <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> was Ilbert de Lacy to whom William the Conqueror had granted a vast Honour stretching widely across country from Lincolnshire into Lancashire, and whose chief stronghold was at Pontefract Castle, a few miles to the south-east.|$|E

50|$|The main {{territory}} {{in which the}} Oliver surname lived and exercised control was Jedforest, an indeterminate area situated south west {{and south of the}} Border town of Jedburgh. Originally the lands of Jedforest were held directly by the King, and as his <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> the Olivers would have held their lands by Crown charter, but after a number of changes in feudal superior, Jedforest was granted by the King to the Clan Douglas (the Red Douglas) under whose protection the Olivers subsequently lived.|$|R
50|$|Brictric's lands {{were granted}} {{after the death}} of Matilda in 1083 by her eldest son King William Rufus (1087-1100) to Robert FitzHamon (died 1107), the conqueror of Glamorgan, whose {{daughter}} and sole heiress Maud (or Mabel) FitzHamon brought them to her husband Robert de Caen, 1st Earl of Gloucester (pre-1100-1147), a natural son of Matilda's younger son King Henry I (1100-1135). Thus Brictric's fiefdom became the feudal barony of Gloucester. The Grenville family held Bideford for many centuries under the overlordship of the feudal barons of Gloucester, which barony was soon absorbed into the Crown, when they became <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief.</b>|$|R
50|$|In medieval times, the MPs {{would have}} been elected at the county court, by the suitors to the court, which meant the tiny handful of the local nobility who were <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Crown. However, from 1430, the Forty Shilling Freeholder Act {{extended}} {{the right to vote}} to every man who possessed freehold property within the county valued at £2 or more per year for the purposes of land tax; it was not necessary for the freeholder to occupy his land, nor even in later years to be resident in the county at all.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} land tenure has been {{described}} as a [...] "spatial fragmentation of proprietary interests in land". No one person could claim absolute ownership of a parcel of land, except the Crown. Thus the modern concept of [...] "ownership" [...] is not helpful in explaining the complexity of the distribution of rights. In relation to a particular piece of land, a number of people had rights: first, the tenant in demesne with possessory rights; second the mesne lord to whom the tenant owed services; third, a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> to whom the mesne lord owed services; and finally the Crown who received services directly from the <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the Domesday Book it was {{recorded}} as having nine households and being within Diptford Hundred. Alfred de Breton (AKA Auvrai Le Breton) was the <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief.</b> {{one of his}} descendants Richard le Breton went on to kill Thomas Becket ...|$|E
50|$|Knapton is {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it is listed under the name ‘Kanapatone’. The <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> was William de Warenne who was a Norman aristocrat who fought at the Battle of Hastings and became great landowners in England.|$|E
5000|$|In medieval times, {{the custom}} in Kent, as elsewhere, {{was for the}} MPs for the county and those for its boroughs to be elected {{on the same day}} at the county court, by the suitors to the court, which meant the tiny handful of the local nobility who were <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Crown. Thus we find it {{recorded}} that in the second year of the reign of Henry V, [...] "In the County Court of Kent, held at Rochester, Four Coroners and Eight others present, chose the Knights for the County, and the same person elect two Citizens for Canterbury, and two for Rochester." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} no formal record of his legal education, Neville {{was a member of}} Gray's Inn, and by 1514 had begun to oversee the legal process by which <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Crown sued out their liveries to obtain {{possession}} of their estates. In 1529 he was appointed to supervise the suing out of all liveries involving lands in England, Wales and Calais. Between the years 1516 and 1527 he was also in frequent attendance at meetings of King Henry VIII's council, and was active in both Star Chamber and the Court of Requests. It is said that by 1522, of the Masters of Requests only he and Sir Thomas More had access to the King.|$|R
5000|$|In medieval times, {{the custom}} in Wiltshire as {{elsewhere}} was for Members called {{knights of the}} shire to be elected at the county court by the suitors to the court, which meant {{the small number of}} nobles and other landowners who were <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Crown. Such county elections were held on the same day as the election of the members for the boroughs. Thus we find it recorded that {{in the first year of}} the reign of Henry V, [...] "at a full County Court held at Wilton, Twenty-Six persons chose the Knights for the County, and the same individuals elected Two Citizens respectively for New Sarum, Old Sarum, Wilton, Devizes, Malmesbury, Marlborough and Calne." ...|$|R

5000|$|Every {{feoffment}} {{made by a}} new tenant {{could not}} be in frankalmoign, since the donee was a layman; it would be reckoned {{by the laws of}} socage.

Petty serjeanty came to be treated as [...] "socage in effect".|$|E
5000|$|The {{nature of}} Anglo-Saxon land tenure was {{substantially}} {{changed by the}} Norman conquest of England in 1066, as all land was then held by the King under Norman feudal control. The King's <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> held their land in return for provision of men at arms to the King. However, {{the changes in the}} nature of tenure were not absolute. Military service had been a duty of landholders before 1066 and some Anglo-Saxon law and custom continued to apply after the conquest. Domesday does not mention folkland or bookland, but the form of tenure in January 1066 (TRE) is frequently given. Although a variety of wording is used. Ann Williams equates land held [...] "freely" [...] (libere) with bookland.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of the}} Norman Conquest of England, the new king, William I, did {{away with}} the Witenagemot, {{replacing}} it with a Curia Regis ("King's Council"). Membership of the Curia was largely restricted to the <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> the few nobles who [...] "rented" [...] great estates directly from the king, along with ecclesiastics. William brought to England the feudal system of his native Normandy, and sought the advice of the curia regis before making laws. This is the original body from which the Parliament, the higher courts of law, and the Privy Council and Cabinet descend. Of these, the legislature is formally the High Court of Parliament; judges sit in the Supreme Court of Judicature. Only the executive government is no longer conducted in a royal court.|$|R
5000|$|Brictric's lands {{were granted}} {{after the death}} of Matilda in 1083 by her eldest son King William Rufus (1087-1100) to Robert FitzHamon (died 1107), the conqueror of Glamorgan, whose {{daughter}} and sole heiress Maud (or Mabel) FitzHamon brought them to her husband Robert de Caen, 1st Earl of Gloucester (pre-1100-1147), a natural son of Matilda's younger son King Henry I (1100-1135). Thus Brictric's fiefdom became the feudal barony of Gloucester. The Giffard family later held Clovelly as feudal tenant of the Honour of Gloucester, and the Book of Fees records Roger Giffard holding Clovelly [...] "from the part of Earl Richard", that is Richard de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford, 6th Earl of Gloucester (1222-1262), feudal baron of Gloucester. The feudal barony of Gloucester was soon absorbed into the Crown, when the Giffards became <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{portion of}} land here {{was held in}} Saxon times by Godric under {{commendation}} to Edric with 40 acres, 1 bordar, and 1 ploughteam valued at 7s, and under him were two freemen with 12 acres and half a ploughteam valued at 2s.

5000|$|Tyndall (the {{original}} spelling, also Tyndale, [...] "Tindol",Tyndal, Tindall, Tindal, Tindale, Tindle, Tindell, Tindill, and Tindel) is {{the name}} of an English family taken from the land they held as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Kings of England and Scotland in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries: Tynedale, or the valley of the Tyne, in Northumberland. With origins in the ancient Anglo Saxon nobility of Northumbria, the Royal Scottish House of Dunkeld and the Anglo-Norman nobility, they have contributed courtiers, judges, writers, historians, sailors, airmen, scientists and philosophers to the history of England, Ireland and the new world. Two members of the family were offered, and declined, the throne of Bohemia in the 15th century and one of their number, William Tyndale, was the first modern translator of the Bible into English {{and one of the most}} important figures in the evolution of the modern language. The family is spread today throughout the British Isles and the English speaking world.|$|R
5000|$|The {{promises}} {{made in the}} Charter {{could not}} be enforced. There is ample evidence that Henry I ignored them. The Pipe Rolls which came thirty-one years into Henry’s reign indicate he had extended {{the power of the}} crown well beyond the limits set in the Charter. The establishment of the Exchequer, ostensively to end corruption and fraud in the taking and holding of taxes, in reality led to greater power of the crown. The direction of its chief minister, Bishop Roger of Salisbury evolved the law for <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> which became the harshest and most severe in Europe. This occurred silently, and placed precedent upon precedent. Early in his reign, Henry issued a writ declaring the county and hundred courts should be held as in the days of Edward the Confessor. These had the result of bringing the ancient traditional tribunals in accordance with newer Norman methods. Chroniclers of the age state that [...] Henry legislated about theft, restored capital punishment (which had been suspended for a great many crimes by William II), and harshly treated utterers of bad money and rapacious exactions of his courtiers. He made his roving court and army the terror of every neighborhood. Henry made the measure of his own arm the standard ell.|$|R

50|$|Since 2000, Chief Pleas {{was working}} on its own reform, {{responding}} to internal and international pressures. On 8 March 2006 {{by a vote of}} 25-15 Chief Pleas voted for a new legislature of the Seigneur, the Seneschal, 14 elected landowners and 14 elected non-landowners. But it was made plain by the British Lord Chancellor Jack Straw that this option was not on the table. Offered two options for reform involving an elected legislature, one fully elected, one with a number of seats reserved for elected Tenants, 56% of the inhabitants expressed a preference for a totally elected legislature. Following the poll, Chief Pleas voted on 4 October 2006 to replace the 12 Deputies and 40 <b>Tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> Pleas by 28 Conseillers elected by universal adult suffrage. This decision was suspended in January 2007 when it was pointed out to Chief Pleas that the 56% versus 44% majority achieved in the opinion poll did not achieve the 60% majority required for the constitutional change. The decision was replaced by the proposal that Chief Pleas should consist of 16 Tenants and 12 Conseillers both elected by universal adult suffrage from 2008 to 2012 and that a binding referendum should then decide whether this composition should be kept or replaced by 28 Conseillers. This proposal was rejected by the Privy Council and the 28 Conseiller option was reinstated in February 2008 and accepted by Privy Council in April 2008.|$|R
