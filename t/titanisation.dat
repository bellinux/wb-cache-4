40|$|In 3 GHz single-cell {{cavities}} accelerating fields above 20 MV/m {{are obtained}} routinely {{with a maximum}} of E_a_c_c= 31 MV/m. An optimized chemical treatment {{as well as the}} improved single-sided <b>titanisation</b> (SST) results in surface fields above 60 MV/m without any field emission. Typically, the quality factor at 1. 4 K varies between 1. 10 " 1 " 0 and 4. 10 " 1 " 0. The best Q-value of 7. 10 " 1 " 0 corresponds to a surface reistance of only 4. 1 n#OMEGA#. Taking into account the BCS-losses and the surface resistance due to frozen-in-flux no residual resistance was present in this test. The nine-cell structures achieved gradients between 8. 5 MV/m and 16 MV/m at low field Q_ 0 -values above 5. 10 " 9. The application of a high resolution X-ray diagnostic system showed an accumulation of the emission sites on the lower iris of the cells. An improved assembly procedure resulted on Q_ 0 = 3. 5. 10 " 1 " 0 and E_a_c_c= 17. 3 MV/m with a low field emission loading in a final test. Avoiding even traces of hydrocarbon contaminations in the cavity vacuum is crucial for a low residual resistance as well as a high onset of field emission. Pure and dustfree adsorbed gases do not cause a degradation of the RF properties. The quantitative analysis of thermometry data is used for systematic investigations of the local distribution of the residual resistance.
