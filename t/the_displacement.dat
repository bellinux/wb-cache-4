5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} is essentially <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> of a contact line {{such as the}} one in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

40|$|The {{harmonic}} {{chain is}} a classical many-particle system {{which can be}} solved exactly for arbitrary number of particles (at least in simple cases, such as equal masses and spring constants).

The homogeneous metric perturbations on the brane are written by <b>the</b> <b>displacements</b> of <b>the</b> brane and the anisotropic bulk perturbation induced by <b>the</b> <b>displacements.</b> By solving <b>the</b> bulk anisotropic perturbation, we calculate the homogeneous metric perturbations on the positive tension brane and find the large scale CMB anisotropy.
