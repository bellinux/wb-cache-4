40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the law and the antitrust economics of tying. After describing the many varieties of tying arrangements we examine specific legal tying doctrines and gauge their effectiveness in identifying anticompetitive ties. We generally assume that the appropriate antitrust goal is consumer welfare; however, all situations in which consumer welfare is increased by a tie also result in an increase in general welfare. We look at the use of ties as quality control devices and as ways of obtaining both production and distribution efficiencies. Market power in either the <b>tying</b> or <b>tied</b> <b>product</b> is a necessary but not sufficient condition for competitive harm. Further the co-called “leverage” theory of tying has been appropriately denigrated, except for a few exceptional circumstances. However, the term “foreclosure” still serves to describe some anticompetitive ties. The Ninth Circuit recently dismissed a tying claim for failure to allege foreclosure, thus implicitly rejecting leverage claims. We also expand upon the rationale that ties can be used as price discrimination devices and analyze the effects of such ties on consumer welfare. When both the tying and tied markets are noncompetitive ties are commonly used to prevent double marginalization. Such ties produce lower prices, higher output, and increased consumer welfare. If the <b>tying</b> and <b>tied</b> <b>products</b> are perfect complements or nearly so, then welfare increases are highly likely. If the two products are imperfect complements then consumer welfare losses may occur because some buyers are forced to take an unwanted product or do without. In this latter set of cases a bundled discount tends to produce greater welfare because those who wish only one product can continue to purchase it, although at a higher price. Thus bundled discounts serve to discriminate between classes of customers where gains from the elimination of double marginalization are possible and those in which they are not. Whether a firm increases or reduces the price of the primary product upon bundling depends on the elasticity of demand for separate sales, and a price increase does not establish that the bundle is anticompetitive. Finally, we examine optimal damages for tying, looking in particular at the historical test which based damages on <b>tied</b> <b>product</b> overcharges; and the current dominant test which bases damages on the net overcharge of the sum of the <b>tying</b> and <b>tied</b> <b>product</b> prices. We find shortcomings in both methodologies...|$|R

40|$|The law of tying {{arrangements}} as {{it stands}} does not correspond with modern economic analysis. Therefore, and because tying arrangements are so widely common, the law is expected to change and extensive academic writing is currently attempting to guide its way. In tying arrangements, monopolistic firms coerce consumers to buy additional products or services beyond what they intended to purchase. This pressure can be applied because a consumer in a monopolistic market {{does not have the}} alternative to buy the product or service from a competing firm. In the absence of such choice, the monopolistic firm can allegedly force the additional purchase on the consumer at non-beneficial terms. The 2 ̆ 2 <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> 2 ̆ 2 is the one the consumer wants to buy, and the product the firm attaches to the <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> is termed the 2 ̆ 2 tied product. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the monopolistic firm could theoretically extend its period of monopoly. These concerns led the Supreme Court to impose severe restrictions on tying arrangements employed by monopolistic firms. However, as this Article shows, modern economic analysis reveals that the concern was probably exaggerated, and more importantly, that tying arrangements may have significant pro-competitive efficiency justifications. This Article presents a comprehensive economic analysis that demonstrates that tying arrangements, despite their anticompetitive potential, also hold exceedingly significant pro-competitive efficiency potential. It then presents the potential legal rules for analyzing tying arrangements and the two leading approaches in academic writing regarding their appropriate implementation before discussing various tying scenarios and presenting a position regarding their appropriate legal analyses...|$|E
40|$|Many tying {{arrangements}} {{are used by}} firms {{that do not have}} substantial market power in either of the two markets linked together by the tie. Their function must be something other than the enlargement or perpetuation of power. A few ties do involve fairly explicit exercises of market power, but they need not be used for a different purpose than the ties imposed by more competitive firms. This paper considers firms’ use of ties to exploit whatever power they already have over the <b>tying</b> <b>product.</b> The 2 ̆ 2 leverage 2 ̆ 2 theory sees ties as exploiting customers as a group via higher prices, whether or not the tie excludes any rival. By contrast, the foreclosure theory of ties is concerned with exclusion of rivals, mainly in the tied product market, with extension or perpetuation of monopoly as a long term goal. The dominant explanation for variable proportion ties is price discrimination, although it explains some fixed proportion ties as well. Like leveraging, price discrimination results in some customer exploitation. However, while some customers are injured, most price discrimination ties benefit an even larger number of customers and by a greater amount. As a result they are beneficial under both general welfare and consumer welfare antitrust tests. Also like leveraging, a tying firm can profit from price discrimination without foreclosing any rival. Indeed, even firms with small amounts of <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> market power can use price discrimination ties. Although a price-discriminating tie might cover most purchasers of a tied product and thus foreclose a substantial share of the tied market, effective price discrimination neither requires nor typically generates a significant foreclosure or other impairment of the tied market 2 ̆ 7 s structure or performance. Indeed, in many litigated cases the <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> was a common commodity such as dry ice, salt, or ordinary printing ink. The least warrant for antitrust intervention occurs when higher tied product prices fail to result from foreclosure of rivals and are not reflected in customer prices that are not higher overall. For example, most ties of complementary products (1) fail to foreclose any rival from anything because the tied product is a common ingredient or other common expendable input; and also (2) fail to result in higher consumer prices for the tying/tied combination because the firm is in competition with other firms and could not assess a monopoly price increase. The last conclusion is true even though a price discrimination tie typically results in higher prices for the tied product alone. Finally, an even stronger case for lower prices results in situations where the tied product is a manufactured good sold at prices above cost. In those cases tying can eliminate double marginalization, thus benefiting both consumers and the tying seller...|$|E

40|$|Tying {{arrangements}} often increase welfare {{by promoting}} product quality {{and protecting the}} supplier 2 ̆ 7 s goodwill in the <b>tying</b> <b>product.</b> When the <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> works effectively only with ancillary materials or accessories or services of a particular kind or quality, its supplier can assure the requisite quality of the ancillary product only by supplying that product itself. The cost savings defense and the defenses of quality control or good will are the most widely recognized and accepted tying defenses. One characteristic of manufactured products is differentiation among the offerings of various brands. This in turn produces {{a need for more}} specialized provision of such things as supplies, aftermarket parts, and service, thus requiring firms to dedicate their production or distribution to particular product designs. As a consequence firms must also dedicate their production and organization to ongoing relationships with a narrow range of other firms. Franchising is an one example, but there are others. What virtually all of these situations {{have in common is that}} they occur in markets that involve differentiated, typically branded products and fairly specialized aftermarket products or services. Or alternatively, a manufacturer of a complex or delicate machine may require users to have the machine serviced by the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s own employees or agents. A tie might be used in such cases by a firm with no power in the tying market and with no purpose or effect of gaining power in the tied market or even of exploiting customers. This paper considers transaction cost rationales for tying in the context of the types of asset specificity that are common in modern relational contracts, looking particularly at protection of goodwill, manufacturer-supplied specifications or standards as an alternative to tying, and the use of tying to protect a supplier’s trade secrets. Problematically, many of the litigated ties have involved foreclosure of only a minuscule portion of the tied market. Requiring a significant foreclosure before finding prima facie illegality would often obviate the many vexing questions concerning either cost savings or quality control. Asset specificity is ubiquitous, and serves to explain ties in many competitive markets, including franchising, office equipment, and medical services to name a few. A non-foreclosing tie ordinarily has no anticompetitive effects. Under a rule of reason treatment no justification would be required for legality, but even under harsher treatment provable quality protection should defend the tie...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the EC {{competition and}} US antitrust approaches to tying with special reference to economic thinking and intellectual property rights. It establishes that {{from an economic}} perspective that tying cannot be considered purely anticompetitive. Only when certain conditions are present is this the case: market power, an imperfect tied product market, which includes insufficient competition, high barriers to entry, and competitors' inability {{to compete with the}} dominant company's tied product package. Even in these circumstances, tying may have pro-competitive effects, which can outweigh the anti-competitive effects. While in the EC, competition law has completely overtaken the dealings with tying, in the US the Patent Act has adopted a per se legality approach only condemning tying when the intellectual property owner holds market power and applies the tying alTangement together with the patent to extend his patent monopoly to staple products. In comparison, competition law {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic see tying as (almost) illegal per se - almost because both jurisdictions require establishment of market power. A similar four-step test has. been applied in both the EC and the US: 1) market power in the <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> market 2) two separate products 3) anti-competitive effects on the tied product market 4) no objective justifications By assessing these steps in detail, the thesis identifies that when dealing with more complex products, technologically integrated products and products protected by intellectual property rights, the four-step test is inadequate and will often result in a wrong conclusion. The thesis therefore proposes a new test, which takes into consideration economic thinking, the recent reform debate of Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which has proposed a more economic approach to exclusionary behaviour and the fact that intellectual property rights do not always confer market power and also attempts to create greater legal certainty to ensure that despite having market power a company can tie when the pro-competitive benefits outweigh the anti-competitive effects.

40|$|Many of {{the classic}} tying cases {{involved}} <b>tied</b> <b>products</b> that were common staples such as button fasteners, canned ink, dry ice, or salt. These products were sold in competitive markets, presumably at prices very close to cost. For most of them the most likely explanations for the tie were quality control or price discrimination, both with competitively benign results in {{the great majority of}} situations. When the tied good is sold in a noncompetitive market, however, an additional consumer welfare enhancing result is likely to obtain – namely, the elimination of double marginalization, which occurs when separate sellers of complementary products each has market power. The double marginalization result occurs only when both products are sold at prices above the competitive level. It can apply in both the vertical context, such as when a monopoly manufacturer must distribute through a retailer market that is subject to monopoly, oligopoly or collusion, but it also occurs in situations involving complements, such as printers and ink cartridges, hospitals and physicians, or many medical devices that include both durable and reusable components. Indeed, the problem is generally more serious in the complementary situations, because often firms offering complementary products are not in a good position to negotiate with one another for a joint-maximizing output increase, while the participants in a vertical chain of distribution bargain with each other all the time. In cases where both <b>tying</b> and <b>tied</b> <b>products</b> are subject to some market power, the profit maximizing price of a seller who offers both products in a bundle is typically lower than the individual profit-maximizing prices of two sellers, each of which sells only one of the products. Outside of the franchise context, which often involves commodity tying, most ties today involve manufactured <b>tied</b> <b>products</b> subject to at least some product differentiation, and typically nontrivial fixed costs. In all such cases the double marginalization argument presumptively applies and suggest another reason why ties should not be condemned except after a full rule of reason analysis. The typical result of eliminating double marginalization is that output of both the tying and the tied good increase and consumers pay lower prices. The result is a welfare improvement under both the total welfare and consumer welfare tests for competitive harm...|$|R

In this case the European Commission (Commission) applied a rule-of-reason approach {{for the first time to}} Microsoft’s tying practice and considered it to be anticompetitive. Microsoft tied its Windows Media Player (WMP) to its client operating system Windows and after a thorough analysis done by the Commission, Microsoft was considered to have abused its dominant position. In the past the Commission and the European Court of Justice used a per se illegality approach to tying practices and it was enough to establish that a company which applied the tying strategy was dominant in the <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> market. The hostile approach taken by the Commission and the ECJ has been criticized by economists mainly because tying is a commonly applied business strategy in the world economy and companies apply this be-cause of the economic efficiencies that this business strategy leads to. The efficiency gains are indirectly past on to the consumers in the form of product quality and innovation, reduced transaction costs and lower prices. It is argued that tying in fact increase consumer welfare. Economists would therefore rather see a per se legality approach or at least a rule-of-reason approach in the future. Due to the complexity of the Microsoft case, the Commission had to do a thorough analysis of the actual impact that the tying of WMP had on the market and the foreclosure effects that this strategy might lead to. This was therefore the first time that a rule-of-reason approach was applied on the matter of tying. However, after the Commission’s Decision of the Microsoft case there is still uncertainty in this matter. There is a strong need for future clarification. Microsoft Corporation has lodged an appeal against the Commission’s Decision with the European Court of Justice but it will take several years before the ECJ will be able to give a final judgement of the case. Until then the legal certainty is yet still very unclear...|$|E
40|$|Notwithstanding {{hundreds}} of court decisions, tying arrangements remain enigmatic. Conclusions {{that go to}} either extreme, per se legality or per se illegality, invariably make simplifying assumptions that frequently do not obtain. For example, by ignoring double marginalization or <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> price cuts it becomes very easy to prove that {{a wide range of}} ties are anticompetitive. At the other extreme, by ignoring foreclosure possibilities one can readily conclude that ties are invariably benign. Ties have historically been thought to produce two kinds of competitive harm: “leverage,” or extraction; and foreclosure, or exclusion. The two theories are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, the premise of the foreclosure theory is that exclusion of rivals is harmful because it enables a firm to keep prices up or to prevent them from falling in response to the entry of new competitors. Ultimately, anticompetitive foreclosing ties must harm consumers. Is there any reason for thinking that ties that do not exclude anyone should be condemned under the antitrust laws? The issue can arise in several different contexts. The most common is the “unwanted” tied product. The purchaser does not want the tied product at all and is objecting about being forced to take and pay for it. This is basically the facts of the Ninth Circuit’s Brantley case, in which cable television consumers complain that the defendant cable television provider offers programming only in large packages of channels. The complaint was dismissed because the plaintiffs could not identify any independent program providers who were excluded by the arrangement. Another subset of cases involves customers complaining about the way the seller allocates the price between the tying and tied goods, typically in order to facilitate price discrimination. To be sure, customers may be injured when they want to purchase a smaller package than a seller wishes to sell. The customer might wish to buy a single residential lot rather than a rancher’s 1000 acre spread. Neither exclusion of a rival nor a restraint of trade producing lower market output is in prospect. Indeed, in a case such as Brantley the per channel cost of delivering a large number of channels is almost certainly lower than the per channel cost of delivering a few. The fixed cost component of a cable television system is a significant portion of its costs and the incremental costs of adding channels are very low. The Brantley plaintiffs simply want the seller to offer a smaller product. That is fundamentally not an antitrust problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{competition}} {{policy in the}} EU should guarantee that the competition is not distorted {{in the way that}} would prevent or create difficulties for the free mobility of goods and services between Member states. It is prohibited for companies to abuse their dominant position according to Article 82, if it affects trade. The essence of Article 82 is control of market power. The perfect competition results when supply and demand appoint the price and quantity of a product. Firms are encouraged to compete then it results in efficiency, quality products and lower prices. Dominance can be assessed only in relation to three essential variables: the product market, the geographical market and the temporal factor. The determination of the relevant product market is crucial. The general approach of the Commission and the Court to the definition of the product market has been to focus upon interchangeability, {{the extent to which the}} product is interchangeable with other products. From the demand side interchangeability requires investigation of cross-elasticities of the product. The existence of high cross-elasticities indicates that the products are part of the same market. There are different types of abuse, for example price discrimination, refusal to supply and predatory pricing. In Tetra Pak the ECJ held that the company that was a world leader in the manufacture of aseptic cartons for liquid and semi-liquid food had abused its dominant position on the market for aseptic cartons. Tetra Pak asserted that only their products could be used in production when using their machines. Their behaviour, according to ECJ, was abusive then they tried to tie-in consumers and customers. This way of behaviour could also be seen in the Hilti-case concerning nail guns. Tying occurs when the supplier makes the sale of one product (the <b>tying</b> <b>product)</b> conditional upon the purchase of another distinct product (the tied product) from the supplier or someone designated by the latter. Tying is common practice that often has no anticompetitive consequences. The foreclosure of the tied market may allow the dominant company to achieve larger profits in the tied market. We can see the importance of case-law, when the definition of Article 82 is broad. For example have the United Brands-case and Akzo-case determined the presumption for market share and dominant position. The case-law will grow larger through the years and we think it will be clearer for companies what is allowed and forbidden. The problem today is that the competition law is rather indistinct...|$|E

40|$|Both {{economics}} and antitrust policy have traditionally distinguished “production” from “distribution. ” The former {{is concerned with}} how products are designed and built, the latter with how they are placed {{into the hands of}} consumers. Nothing {{in the language of the}} antitrust laws suggests much concern with production as such. Although courts do not view it that way, even per se unlawful naked price fixing among rivals is a restraint on distribution rather than production. Naked price fixing assumes a product that has already been designed and built, and the important cartel decision is what should be each firm’s output, or the price charged to buyers. At the same time, however, many price agreements among rivals are in fact a part of design or production rather than distribution. Many of the difficulties that antitrust law has had with vertical restraints arose because antitrust courts mistakenly viewed a practice as part of distribution when it was really part of design or production. Agreements that seem nominally to be about distribution or price are in fact mechanisms by which firms share design and production activities. For example, tying arrangements are not simply ways of pricing finished goods. Rather, as the long history of tying-like practices in patent law illustrates, most tying is the consequence of a design or production choice or else a mechanism for sharing entrepreneurial risk. Particularly misunderstood are variable proportion, or metering, ties. Ignoring incentive effects, when the seller has a monopoly in the <b>tying</b> <b>product</b> and the tied product is perfectly competitive, such ties may reduce short run consumer welfare from the single monopoly price, at least if they also reduce output of the durable good. However, that result is trivial across the range of litigated variable proportion tying cases. The sellers in these cases are virtually never monopolists or even close. When metering ties are imposed by nonmonopolists the welfare effects are unambiguously positive. An antitrust policy driven by concerns for consumer welfare should favor design and production initiatives but disfavor restraints on pricing. Indeed, it is more important for antitrust policy to get the innovation question right than to be right on price, because innovation has the potential to affect economic development much more dramatically, and in both directions. That is, just as innovation benefits the economy by a greater amount than price competition under constant technology, so too a restraint on innovation can do greater harm. By focusing so much on price, antitrust policy has often missed the point of some arrangements, particularly those that involve new technologies or innovations in business organization. In the process, it has confused innovation with monopoly. For example, antitrust’s long war with tying arrangements occurred because litigants and courts were obsessed with pricing and either never queried or else did not appreciate how tying relates to innovation and production. By their nature, innovations upset a market’s equilibrium, producing temporarily higher returns. As a result, a common feature of innovation is short-run prices that are above cost and welfare reducing to the myopic eye. These are essential features of innovation-intensive markets, however, and in such cases the social cost of false condemnation is high...|$|E

In {{the presence of the}} nonnegative price constraint, tying provides a mechanism to circumvent the constraint in the <b>tied</b> <b>product</b> market without inviting an aggressive response by the rival firm. We identify conditions under which tying in two-sided markets is promotable and explore its welfare implications. In addition, we show that our model can be applied more widely to any markets in which sales to consumers in one market can generate additional revenues that cannot be competed away due to non-negative price constraints...|$|R

We employ agent-based simulation and evolutionary game theory {{in the light of}} innovative diffusion process with network externality and sustainability consciousness, in microscopic and dynamic emergent perspectives. We suggest a strategic decision management insight for better marketing an environmental sustainable product in a new product diffusion process. We show that both market share and long-term profitability of a <b>tied</b> <b>product</b> firm, with inferior market share, indeed can be raised significantly by applying the suggested price-protection-distribution decision strategy at specific timing when the ecologically conscious consumer segment grows. sustainable economy; environmental sustainability; technology adoption; replicator dynamics; agent-based modelling; complex system simulation; regional diffusion; remanufactured tied products; ecologically conscious consumers; agent-based systems; multi-agent systems; component remanufacturing. ...|$|R
5000|$|Since Congress had {{not spoken}} {{one way or the}} other about tying nonstaples, Sherry argues, the Court should have looked to the patent law policy that disfavors {{contributory}} infringement, to the misuse policy disfavoring tie-ins, and considered each. Had it done so, [...] "it might have opted for a more cautious and reasonable resolution to the Dawson conflict." [...] Sherry maintains:A tying scheme can enhance the economic reward received by a patent owner making the legal monopoly more profitable to the inventor. Increasing the remunerative aspects of the patent monopoly promotes the policy objectives of the patent law. Conversely, requiring the patent owner to license competitors that supply the <b>tied</b> <b>product</b> fosters competition favored by the antitrust laws. Permitting the use of a tying arrangement only when competition in the unpatented nonstaple component is maintained represents a balanced approach toward resolving the policy conflict present in Dawson.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} “tying ” {{are based on}} the premise that there are clear {{boundaries}} between <b>tied</b> <b>products.</b> However, in the computing industry there are constant battles over boundaries between complementary products. A dominant firm in one layer of a multilayered system usually attempts to extend into other layers by including some of the latter’s functions into its own products. For instance, Microsoft’s Windows expanded its boundary to include several applications such as Internet Explorer and Media Player, which were supplied by its “complementors. ” When one of two firms expands its product boundary to make its product less dependent on its complement, it may help to solve the well-known "double mark-up " problem that plagues industries with vertically related monopolies, even though one product does not completely replace the other product. Thus, the expansion of the firm’s product boundary increases not only its own profits, but also the profits of its complementor and social welfare...|$|R
40|$|Patent {{law is the}} {{cornerstone}} of American innovation policy. The relationship between patents and innovation, however, is more complicated than the simple explanation that patents reward innovators. Patent holders sometimes engage in conduct that can reduce innovation. This article examines one type of such conduct: tying arrangements. Patentees sometimes employ tying arrangements as a metering device to effect price discrimination. While some commentators would justify patent tying as pro-innovation because it increases the rewards to the patentee. This Article addresses with the argument that price discrimination through patent tying encourages innovation. In particular, it reviews the innovation arguments made in favor of patent tying; critiques these arguments by explaining how metered tying is not necessarily an appropriate mechanism for rewarding and funding research efforts; explains how patent tying can reduce the incentives for innovation in the <b>tied</b> <b>product</b> market; and discusses how antitrust law should treat patent tying in light of the impact that such tying may have on incentives to innovate...|$|R
