5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog Fractions {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog Fractions was taken more seriously among gamers. Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games, he never intentionally developed Frog Fractions with that in mind. Instead, Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an educational theme because of the name's alliteration, and because he considered educational games {{a part of his}} youth.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of World War II, {{evacuated}} and orphaned children were the subjects of studies that outlined <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> to separation, including the ability to cope by forming relationships with other children. Some of this material remained unpublished until the post-war period and only gradually contributed to understanding of young children's reactions to loss.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Communist Party {{immediately}} attacked Piłsudski as {{a fascist}} and capitalist, though fascists themselves {{did not see}} {{him as one of}} them. Other opponents of the Sanation regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as Ignacy Daszyński and Tomasz Arciszewski) and Christian Democrats (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, Stanisław Wojciechowski and Władysław Grabski) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> (Wincenty Witos voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but Maciej Rataj and Stanisław Thugutt being supportive), while Roman Dmowski's National Democrats expressed a toned-down criticism.|$|E

5|$|The {{highlights}} of the match included the sending-off of Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira for a second bookable offence, for an incident that also brought about a booking for Manchester United centre-forward Ruud van Nistelrooy, and the decision by referee Steve Bennett to award Manchester United a penalty kick in the last minute of the match. Players from both teams were charged by The Football Association (the FA) for <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> {{at the end of}} the game, five Arsenal players and two Manchester United players were forced to pay fines.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse <b>their</b> <b>reactions.</b> These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis. These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{deals on}} a {{personal}} level with the change in Bond from a depressed man in mourning, to a man of action bent on revenge, to an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman. Through the mouths of his characters, Fleming also examines the decline of post-World WarII British power and influence, notably in relation to the United States. The book was popular with the public, with pre-orders in the UK totalling 62,000; critics were more muted in <b>their</b> <b>reactions,</b> generally delivering mixed reviews of the novel.|$|E

5|$|Working out of Tony Leech's apartment, Cory Edwards sketched the film's storyboards, Todd Edwards {{wrote the}} script while {{simultaneously}} writing the songs, and Leech edited the story reel on his Mac computer. Producer Sue Bea Montgomery showed test screenings {{of the story}} reel to children in her neighborhood, and gained input from <b>their</b> <b>reactions.</b> The filmmakers had been considering removing Japeth, but chose not to when he proved popular at these screenings. The children also particularly liked Twitchy, {{which led to the}} expansion of the character's role.|$|E
5|$|After the {{televised}} draft, Joey Styles, the Director of Digital Media Content for WWE's official website, interviewed the draftees on <b>their</b> <b>reactions.</b> The drafted wrestlers generally expressed {{approval of the}} draft and described what they hoped their experiences would be with their new brand. Seven of the wrestlers were champions with their original brand, and as outlined in the draft regulations, they carried their titles over to their new brand; this affected seven of nine championships. Champion draft selections included: Unified Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter, WWE Champion Triple H, and Divas Champion Maryse from SmackDown to Raw; Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw to SmackDown. Since Triple H was drafted to Raw, it left SmackDown without a top contested title, as Raw now featured {{two of the three}} top contested championships in WWE: the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships (although Edge would later brought the World Heavyweight Championship title back to SmackDown as its exclusive-top title following his win against John Cena at Backlash). When Mysterio and Porter switched brands, the two secondary championships switched brands {{for the first time in}} WWE's history. This also occurred when Melina and Maryse switched brands, as the two female contested titles also switched brands for the first time. Though the Unified Tag Team Champions were both drafted over to Raw from SmackDown, the titles were able to be defended on all three brands due to being unified.|$|E
5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for <b>their</b> <b>reactions.</b> The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E

25|$|Social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{can be defined}} as an “interpersonal process” wherein, after an emotional event, “individuals will initiate interpersonal behaviours in which discussing this event and <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> to it is central”. In other words, the social sharing of emotions is the process of reactivating the emotion at a more symbolic level, all taking place as part of ensuing interpersonal interactions.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Dr. V. S. Ramachandran and his lab {{proposed}} that caloric stimulation might {{be effective in}} treating Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. They hypothesized that if cold water was streamed into the ear down the auditory canal, the symptoms associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome would be alleviated. Ramachandran stated that he had carried out provisional experiments on two patients and believed that <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> supported his theory.|$|E

25|$|The rouge test is {{a version}} of the mirror test used with children. Using rouge makeup, an {{experimenter}} surreptitiously places a dot {{on the face of the}} child. The child is then placed in front of a mirror and <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> are monitored; depending on the child's development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. This test is widely cited as the primary measure for mirror self-recognition in human children.|$|E
25|$|The {{episode was}} also notable for the intense and {{emotional}} response it pulled from viewers, {{many of whom}} were unaware of what was about to transpire and had <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> filmed by people who had read the book on which it was based.
