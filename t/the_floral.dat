Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between <b>the</b> <b>floral</b> tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E
