Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you <b>think</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E

I have nothing to do now, boys, and have been reading all this day like Gumdragon; and yet I was dictating some trifles this morning to a printer. I dined with a friend hard by, and the weather was so discouraging I could not walk. I came home early, and have read two hundred pages of Arran. Alexander the Great is just dead: I do not think he was poisoned; betwixt you and me, all those are but idle stories: it is certain that neither Ptolemy nor Aristobulus thought so, and they were both with him when he(12) died. It is a pity we have not their histories. The Bill for limiting Members of Parliament to have but so many places passed the House of Commons, and will pass the House of Lords, in spite of the Ministry, which you know is a great lessening of the Queen's power. Four of the new lords voted against the Court in this point. It is certainly a good Bill in the reign of an ill prince, but I <b>think</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not settled enough for it at present. And the Court may want a majority upon a pinch.

Put yourself in their place, sir, and try and realize the torture of it. I've been amongst 'em. I've spent half of what I made, and a good many thousands it was, buying food for them. Can you wonder that my fingers have itched for the throats of these smug, prosperous pigs, who spurt platitudes and <b>think</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> very well as they are because they're making their little bit?
