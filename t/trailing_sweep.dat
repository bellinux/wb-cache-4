The shaman cuts plants with a sacred sword, sweeps the dead plants with a stick, digs up the roots of the plants, stomps on the humps of the <b>trail,</b> <b>sweeps</b> away the stones, smoothens the trail, waters the trail to dispose of the dust, covers mud with a belt, and releases butterflies into the air. Finally, the shaman covers the trails with a long piece of linen, slices up the linen, and sprinkles rice and powder on the linen.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} figure to the right implies that the MAC occurs {{at a point where}} leading or <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> changes. In general, this is not the case. Any shape other than a simple {{trapezoid}} requires evaluation of the above integral.|$|R
50|$|The thin, unswept, short-span, low-aspect-ratio {{trapezoidal}} configuration {{offers some}} advantages for high-speed flight {{and has been}} used on {{a small number of}} aircraft types. In this wing configuration the leading edge sweeps back and the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweeps</b> forward. It can provide low aerodynamic drag at high speeds, while maintaining high strength and stiffness, and was used successfully during the early days of supersonic aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|The 707 was a [...] "proof-of-concept" [...] delta {{design that}} was principally {{the work of}} Stuart D. Davies, Avro chief designer. The {{diminutive}} experimental aircraft initially incorporated a wing with about 50° sweep, without a horizontal tail on a fin with <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep.</b> The <b>trailing</b> edge of the wing carried two pairs of control surfaces: inboard elevators and outboard ailerons.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{aerodynamics}} of rotor blade tip vortices are examined. Two particular categories are dealt with; (1) dynamic loads on a blade passing close to or intersecting a trailing vortex, and (2) {{the response of the}} trailing vortex core to changes in the flow. Results for both categories are in reasonable agreement with existing data, although lower pressure gradients were obtained than anticipated for category one. A correlation between <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> angle at the tip and vortex core size was noted for category two...|$|R
40|$|Two simple wings were {{selected}} for study using the various implementations (old and new) of the vortex lattice method. These are: (1) a rectangular wing with an aspect ratio of 2, and (2) a tapered wing with an aspect ratio of 5, a taper ratio of 0. 5, a leading sweep of 3. 317 deg., and a <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> of 1 - 11. 308 deg. This was done {{in order to gain}} an appreciation for the accuracy of the various implementations. References were given where force, moment, and pressure data could be found for these wings...|$|R
50|$|In a {{straight}} trapezoidal wing, such {{as on the}} Bell X-1, the thickest part of the wing along its span, the line of maximum chord, runs straight out sideways from root to tip. The leading edge then sweeps backwards and the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweeps</b> forward. In a swept trapezoidal wing, the line of maximum chord is swept at an angle, usually forward. This increases the sweep of the leading edge and decreases the <b>sweep</b> of the <b>trailing</b> edge, and in the extreme case both edges sweep backwards by different amounts. The transition form, where the trailing edge is straight, is equivalent to a cropped delta planform.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley low turbulence pressure tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of wing leading edge radius and Reynolds number on the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of a series of highly swept wing-body configurations. The tests were conducted at Mach numbers below 0. 30, angles of attack up to 16 deg, and Reynolds numbers per meter from 6. 57 million to 43. 27 million. The wings under study in this investigation had leading edge sweep angles of 61. 7 deg, 64. 61 deg, and 67. 01 deg in combination with <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> angles of 0 deg and 40. 6 deg.

5000|$|The Navy {{went on to}} give Northrop Grumman a {{contract}} for a naval UCAV demonstrator with the designation of [...] "X-47A Pegasus", in early 2001. The proof-of-concept X-47A vehicle was built under contract by Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites at the Mojave Spaceport. The Pegasus demonstrator looks like a simple black arrowhead with no vertical tailplane. It has a leading edge sweep of 55 degrees and a <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> of 35 degrees. The demonstrator has retractable tricycle landing gear, with a one-wheel nose gear and dual-wheel main gear, and has six control surfaces, including two elevons and four [...] "inlaids". The inlaids are small flap structures mounted {{on the top and}} bottom of the wing forward of the wingtips.|$|R
50|$|The inner {{part of the}} Falke's wing had {{constant}} chord but it became a little narrower outboard where the <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> decreased. The ailerons increased the chord again to about its inboard value. It was a two spar structure with plywood covering from the forward spar around the leading edge, forming a D-shaped torsion box. Aft the wing, including the ailerons, was fabric covered. It was mounted high over the fuselage on two vertical underwing cabane struts, {{one on each side}} of the open cockpit to the forward wing strut and by a ply covered, triangualar support pylon centrally behind it. On each side a V-pair of lift struts braced the two wing spars, at about 40% of the span, to the lower fuselage longeron.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} tip chord {{orientation}} on wing flutter are investigated experimentally using six cantilever-mounted, flat-plate wing models. Experimentally determined flutter {{characteristics of the}} six models are presented covering both the subsonic and transonic Mach number ranges. While all models have a 60 degree leading edge sweep, a 40. 97 degree <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep,</b> and a root chord of 34. 75 inches, they are subdivided into two series characterized by a higher aspect ratio and a lower aspect ratio. Each series {{is made up of}} three models with tip chord orientations which are parallel to the free-stream flow, perpendicular to the model mid-chord line, and perpendicular to the free-stream flow. Although planform characteristics within each series of models are held constant, structural characteristics such as mode shapes and natural frequencies are allowed to vary...|$|R
50|$|Tejas has a pure {{double delta}} wing {{configuration}} (wing root leading edge sweep 50°, outer wing leading edge <b>sweep</b> 62.5° and <b>trailing</b> edge forward <b>sweep</b> 4°), with no tailplanes or canard, and a single dorsal fin. It integrates technologies such as relaxed static stability, fly-by-wire flight control system, multi-mode radar, integrated digital avionics system, composite material structures, and a flat rated engine. It is the smallest and lightest in its class of contemporary supersonic combat aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The 55° {{swept wing}} {{had a slight}} {{negative}} camber, and was fitted {{with a pair of}} aerodynamic fences to prevent the spanwise flow of air away from the wing roots. The leading edge of the wing incorporated a pair of PVD leading edge slats. Flaps and ailerons were mounted on the trailing edge of the wing. The outer flaps were aligned with the <b>trailing</b> edge forward <b>sweep</b> and the inner flaps were perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body.|$|R
25|$|The wing is of single-spar {{construction}} that {{passes through the}} aircraft's fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under 20 metres. Outboard of the engine nacelles, the wing has a leading edge sweep of 4° and <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> of −14°. All flight controls are manual, using push-rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These actuate the aircraft's flight control surfaces, including shrouded-nosed ailerons, four-section conventional split-type flaps, and atypical airbrakes which comprise 40 hydraulically-raised fingers located {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of the wings. Swept-wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF Hawker Typhoon and Westland Whirlwind fighter-bombers.|$|R
40|$|On {{present day}} high {{performance}} aircraft, {{a large portion}} of the lift is generated by leading edge vortices generated by flow separation off the highly swept leading edges of the lifting surfaces employed. It has been shown in an earlier paper how the vortex effects can be superimposed on a modified slender wing theory to give the unsteady longitudinal characteristics of sharp-edged delta wings up to very high angles of attack. The present paper extends the previous analysis to include the effects of leading edge roundness and <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep</b> on the aerodynamic characteristics. The paper also derives analytic means for prediction of the yaw stability of slender wings and the first order effects of Mach number. Universal scaling laws are defined for rapid preliminary design estimates of the slender wing lift and rolling moment. The results indicate that simple analytic tools can be developed to predict the aeroelastic characteristics of the space shuttle ascent configuration with its complicated flow field and aeroelastic cross-couplings...|$|R

40|$|The {{results were}} {{presented}} of a parametric study performed {{to determine the}} optimum wing geometry for a proposed space shuttle orbiter. The {{results of the study}} establish the minimum weight wing for a series of wing-fuselage combinations subject to constraints on aerodynamic heating, wing <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep,</b> and wing over-hang. The study consists of a generalized design evaluation which has the flexibility of arbitrarily varying those wing parameters which influence the vehicle system design and its performance. The study is structured to allow inputs of aerodynamic, weight, aerothermal, structural and material data in a general form so that the influence of these parameters on the design optimization process can be isolated and identified. This procedure displays the sensitivity of the system design of variations in wing geometry. The parameters of interest are varied in a prescribed fashion on a selected fuselage and the effect on the total vehicle weight is determined. The primary variables investigated are: wing loading, aspect ratio, leading edge sweep, thickness ratio, and taper ratio...|$|R
40|$|Small axial-flow fans {{used for}} {{computer}} cooling {{and many other}} appliances feature a rotor driven by a downstream motor held by several cylindrical struts. This study focuses on the aerodynamic mechanism of rotor-strut interaction for an isolated fan. The three-dimensional, unsteady flow field is calculated using FLUENT?, and the sound radiation predicted by acoustic analogy is compared with measurement data. Striking differences are found between the pressure oscillations {{in various parts of}} the structural surfaces during an interaction event. The suction surface of the blade experiences a sudden increase in pressure when the blade <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweeps</b> past a strut, while the process of pressure decrease on the pressure side of the blade is rather gradual during the interaction. The contribution of the latter towards the total thrust force on the structure is cancelled out significantly by that on the strut. In terms of the acoustic contributions from the rotor and strut, the upstream rotor dominates and this feature differs from the usual rotor-stator interaction acoustics in which the downstream part is responsible for most of the noise. It is therefore argued that the dominant interaction mechanism is potential flow in nature. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations {{and global}} stability analysis {{were carried out}} to investigate the effect of sweep on {{the dynamics of the}} transitional separation bubbles forming on the suction side of a NACA- 0012 airfoil at Re = 50, 000. The results show that the laminar-turbulent transition of the separation bubbles leads to the shedding of vortices {{at the back of the}} bubble, which is caused by the spatial growth of a K-H instability of the detached shear layer induced by the bubble. The convective instability of the shear layer is sustained by an acoustic feedback loop from the airfoil's <b>trailing</b> edge. <b>Sweep</b> affects this self sustained transition process mainly by modifying the dispersion relation of the acoustic waves responsible for the excitation of the instability modes, leading to different characteristics of the dominant shear layer modes for different angles of sweep. While in the unswept case vortex shedding is the consequence of an oblique transition process dominated by two oblique Kelvin-Helmholtz modes with opposite spanwise wavenumbers, one of these two modes dominates over the other when sweep is introduced. This appears to be mainly due to differences in the acoustic receptivity of modes with opposite spanwise wavenumbers for nonzero sweep. A dynamic mode decomposition of the DNS results showed that, in all cases, the separation bubble undergoes three-dimensional oscillations due to the existence of a globally unstable mode, with frequencies about one order of magnitude lower than the dominant shear layer mode. The results from a global two-dimensional linear stability study of the time- and span-averaged flow were found to be in good agreement with the DNS data...|$|R
40|$|Within the German future {{launcher}} technology {{research program}} ASTRA a reusable concept called a winged liquid fly-back booster (LFBB) is under investigation. This booster should replace the solid rocked booster af Ariane 5. During the last design cycle the configuration LFBB Y 7 was tested intensively in DLR trisonic wind tunnel TMK and hypersonic wind tunnel H 2 K at longitudinal and lateral flow conditions covering the complete flight trajectory from separation at hypersonic speeds {{down to the}} subsonic fly-back cruise regime. Six component force measurements were carried out with a 1 : 151 scale model to create a complete aerodynamic data set for stability, trim and control efficiency. In addition {{the characteristics of the}} flow field of this vehicle including the strong interaction between the canards and the wing was investigated in more detail. Therefore flow was visualised by oil flow pattern and schlieren pictures. Analysis of these test results together with numerical investigations lead to an improved design LFBB Y 8. The main differences to the previous configuration are smaller canards with an unsymmetrical airfoil and modified leading and <b>trailing</b> edge <b>sweep.</b> The wing airfoil was replaced by an supercritical one. Another 1 : 151 scale model of this new fly back booster configuration Y 8 is ready for wind tunnel tests. LFBB Y 8 has a higher degree of details compared with LFBB Y 7. Possible left and right canard deflections are - 10 °, 0 ° and + 10 °, body flap deflection are 0 °, 5 ° and 30 °. For comparison it is possible to omit the canards and the inlets of the three turbo engines. The presentation will summarise the results of the investigations of LFBB Y 7 firstly.

The regarded partially reusable space tranportation system consists of two booster stages, which are attached to the expendable Ariane 5 core stage at an upgraded future technology level. The main area of interest of the present study is the return flight after the staging procedure which domi-CLα CL α∂⁄∂ nates the aerodynamic design of the LFBB. The goal considered in the present paper is the re-finement of an existing LFBB design. With view to the trim of the vehicle former results show that there is an essential need to consider a configuration with canards. The canard deflections then may be limited to ηcan≈ 8 ° for subsonic flow and they are always smaller than ηcan= 5 ° for super- and hypersonic flight conditions. Main problem of the current configuration is the lack of longitudinal stability during the sub- / transonic cruise flight at M< 0. 7.
