New Year's Day 1945 dawned with CVE-71 steaming as part of Task Unit 77.4.3 (Lingayen <b>Transport</b> <b>Cover</b> Group) bound for the invasion of western Luzon. After passing through Surigao Straits, the convoy underwent a series of air attacks. Air cover destroyed seven enemy planes but at 1857 an Nakajima Ki-43 [...] "Oscar" [...] got through and crashed Kitkun Bay's portside amidships at the waterline. Almost simultaneously a 5 inch shell struck her starboard side. The resultant fires and flooding were brought under control, but 16 were dead and 37 wounded. The following day with a list and only one engine operating she withdrew and proceeded by stages first to Leyte, Manus, Pearl Harbor and arrived San Pedro, California, 28 February.|$|E
40|$|Mixing and {{transport}} processes in surface waters strongly influence {{the structure of}} aquatic ecosystems. The impact of mixing on algal growth is species-dependent, affecting the competition among species and acting as a selective factor for {{the composition of the}} biocoenose. Were it not for the ever-changing ”aquatic weather”, the composition of pelagic ecosystems would be relatively simple. Probably just a few optimally adapted algal species would survive in a given water-body. In contrast to terrestrial ecosystems, in which the spatial heterogeneity is primarily responsible for the abundance of niches, in aquatic systems (especially in the pelagic zone) the niches are provided by the temporal structure of physical processes. The latter are discussed in terms of the relative sizes of physical versus biological time-scales. The relevant time-scales of mixing and <b>transport</b> <b>cover</b> the range between seconds and years. Correspondingly, their influence on growth of algae is based on different mechanisms: rapid changes are relevant for the fast biological processes such as nutrient uptake and photosynthesis, and the slower changes are relevant for the less dynamic processes such as growth, respiration, mineralization, and settling of algal cells. Mixing time-scales are combined with a dynamic model of photosynthesis to demonstrate their influence on algal growth...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} that the growth of GDP induces the growth of motorization. Motorization has developed so dramatically that the air, soil, water pollutions are considerable to the amounts of air, soil and water of Earth. Some of the pollutants affect on local or regional scale while others affect on global scale. There is the natural, non-antropogeneous greenhouse gas emission developed before the human activity that has been essential for life on Earth. Without it the average world temperature would be - 20 ÂºC. [1] Sustainable development is a development where the pace of technical development, the satiation of increasing supply, raw materials and resources of Earth are poised so {{that the rate of}} living and opportunities of the next generations need not to be worse. So global warming caused by the antropogeneous and non-antropogeneous CO 2 can be estimated. The measured data is from the non-antropogenous source, but prediction can be done. To have the best result I have made a Best Fit Analize. The prediction should be parabolic because when the CO 2 concentration grows smog or cloud arises that blocks sunlight from Earth, the only source of heat. The growing CO 2 concentration part of the parabola can be approximated by linear trend. The other part of the emissions caused by the motorization is local or regional. Theoretically one solution could be to stop motorised transportation. Transportation cannot be replaced because it is the part of the production chain. Societies are horizontally and vertically differential. People live in different places and do different things for living. The manpower, the stock, the semi-finished and finished products must be transported. The importance of the transportation sector is indicated by the sector production which is 10 % of the GDP of the European Union and more than 10 million people are working in this sector. One of the most emphasized goals of the transport policy of the European Union is sustainable mobility. For this reason transportation systems must be developed and standardized, the effectiveness of transportation service must be increased, while the environmental pollution must be decreased or prevented. This is a task for engineers and operators as well. People who would like to make rational decisions, make an optimization, choosing the maximum utility and benefit. Theoretically, all benefits and costs should be accounted in the analysis. Externalities should be internalised and indicated in the cost of transportation according to the EU guideline â€žUsers should pay the billâ€. Some of the external costs can simply be added to the average costs but some of them need a totally different aspect and pricing method, the marginal costs based pricing method. The more realistic pricing method we want the more externalities should be included to the marginal costs based pricing method. Some of them can be calculated and monetized, some of them can be estimated, and some of them cannot be expressed in monetary terms. The environmental external effects of <b>transport</b> <b>cover</b> a wide range of different impacts, including for example noise, local/regional air pollution and climate change. Transport infrastructure projects often affect local and regional air pollution. Emissions from road traffic are good examples of a complex system with an output that cannot be completely measured. It is natural to analyze the emissions from a sample of vehicles under different driving conditions and other conditions (temperature, fuel content, road gradients, etc.) and to try to create an emission model for the traffic. Depending on what data are collected about the traffic the model may be more or less detailed and complex. Traffic data are not collected in the same way and with the same level of detail in every country and this is a problem if a model is meant to be used for calculations in many countries or for comparisons between them. The EURO standards based on the ECE-R 15 driving cycle: [3] Each vehicle category has its own limits. The vehicle flow can be divided into groups by EURO standards and vehicle categories with its pollutant limits. Being aware of the vehicle numbers in each category multiplied with the limit they can be summarised. Now the pollutants can be calculated from the given vehicle flow and the given distance.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how geochemical dispersion {{may be used}} in areas of deep <b>transported</b> <b>cover</b> to locate buried mineralization. Two regions with contrasting weathering history and <b>transported</b> <b>cover</b> were investigated. These are the Mt Isa region of northern Queensland and the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia. At both locations, <b>transported</b> <b>cover</b> is from 20 – 70 m thick. A range of techniques and instruments, including bulk geochemistry, SEM, electron microprobe and selective extraction analyses were used to understand the vertical distribution and nature of ore-related elements. At the Eloise Cu-Au Deposit in the Mt Isa region, Mesozoic cover lies over prospective Proterozoic basement which is largely unweathered. At Eloise, the degree of weathering, below the unconformity and <b>transported</b> <b>cover,</b> is minimal so weathering-related dispersion in basement and cover is also minimal. There is no dispersion of indicator elements into the upper parts of the unweathered Mesozoic sediments. Mechanical dispersion dominates as is indicated by the SEM and petrographic study and is restricted to basal sediments (last few metres). Unweathered sulphides occur in the basement and in the fragments of clastic basement material and fossil organic matter in the silty matrix of the Mesozoic sediments. The palaeotopography governs the direction of dispersion and needs to be thoroughly understood before meaningful interpretation. The Lancefield South Au Deposit has a cover of highly weathered Permian to Quaternary sediments on Archaean basement of the Yilgarn Craton. Stacked weathering profiles in each sedimentary unit allowed transfer of Au, As, Cu and Zn across the weathering profiles (paleosols) by hydrogeochemical and vegetation interactions as they evolved. High paleo-watertables within the Permian sediments have allowed upward migration of metals reaching close {{to the surface of the}} Permian sediments. Bioturbation and transpiration pumped the anomalous metals into the overlying Tertiary and Quaternary sediments from the Permian. Although regolith anomalies are weakened, especially in the Tertiary and Quaternary cover by post-depositional weathering processes over a long time, they still clearly remain. Thus, a highly weathered sedimentary cover is likely to trap indicator elements more effectively than an unweathered sedimentary cover, such as at Eloise. In addition to basal sediments or interfaces, ferruginous horizons in weathered sediments high in the sequence can also be anomalous in ore-related metals. Ravi R. Anand and Ian D. M. Robertso...|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{exploration}} through <b>transported</b> <b>cover</b> {{is becoming}} one of the fundamental challenges for the exploration industry in this century. The sharp increase in demand for commodities driven by a growing population and technology-based society is coupled with the decrease in world-class ore deposit discoveries in the last three decades. This is setting the stage for an unprecedented scenario, that is, ensuring that the market supply for criticalmetals (Ni, Co, Au, PGE, etc.) is satisfied. This situation is becoming the driving force for a restructuring of mineral exploration paradigms. New technologies and methodologies are being developed; and, as a consequence, regions thatwere considered to be unfavourable for ore deposit exploration are nowbeing reconsidered. Among these areas are vast regions of Regolith-Dominated Terrains (RTD) with basement rock suites buried under thick <b>transported</b> <b>cover</b> and/or deeply weathered profiles.
