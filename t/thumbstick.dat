5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one <b>thumbstick</b> or set of keys, and firing weapons {{is controlled by the}} other <b>thumbstick</b> or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} for Sigma is {{very similar}} to the original version, albeit with some modifications made to the game. Like the original version, the player's movements and combat system are directed using the console gamepad, which comprises the left <b>thumbstick,</b> two attack buttons, and a block button. The game features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. A new addition to Ryu's arsenal is a pair of dual-wield swords, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang. It also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ninpo, which allows him to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself. By shaking the Sixaxis controller, players are able to increase the power of their ninpo spells. Rachel, a non-playable character in the 2004 game, became playable in three new chapters, featuring the new bosses, Gamov and Alterator. Some of the design elements of the old levels was also changed and several new enemy types were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Voltron: Defender of the Universe {{is played}} {{primarily}} as a twin stick shooter. During most levels players control one of five Voltron lions. The lions are equipped with multi-directional cannons, controlled with the right <b>thumbstick,</b> while the left <b>thumbstick</b> coordinates movement. Each lion is equipped with pounce and melee attacks. Each lion features a unique special attack and individual strengths and weaknesses. These levels consist of both ground and space-based levels, with only secondary controls changing between the two environments. The game features cooperative gameplay with up to five players. Up to two players can play on a local machine, and the game supports any combination of local and online players up to five. The game features leaderboards and a downloadable challenge mode in which players must combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.|$|E
5000|$|... (Released in 2008)Evil Sticks are professional-grade <b>thumbsticks</b> {{designed}} to fuse the best {{elements of the}} Xbox 360 controller <b>thumbsticks</b> with those found on the PS3 controller. Evil Sticks feature a shorter height than the default OEM <b>Thumbsticks</b> and are convex instead of concave. This offers gamers greater force feedback which reverts the <b>thumbsticks</b> to the neutral position with greater ease.|$|R

Since 2008, Evil Controllers has continued to innovate on Microsoft’s original Xbox 360 Controller OEM design by addressing {{some of the issues}} that the controller, love it or hate it, was infamous for.|$|R
500|$|Players {{control the}} Delta Saber from a view {{as if they}} were in the cockpit, or a slight {{distance}} away from and outside the craft. [...] The controller's <b>thumbstick</b> are used to fly the starfighter in any direction. [...] By pressing the maneuver button and pushing the <b>thumbstick</b> in a direction, the player makes his or her fighter perform aileron rolls and 180-degrees turns (half-loops). [...] Various button combinations control the Delta Saber's speed, allowing the craft to boost to great speeds with afterburners, coast on inertia without power, or match speed with a target. [...] Certain maneuvers require the expenditure of shield energy, which protects starships from damage; an unshielded vessel under attack suffers damage to its armor. [...] A ship is destroyed when its armor is depleted.|$|E
500|$|In the third-person action-adventure game Kameo (pronounced [...] "cameo"), {{the player}} {{controls}} the title character, an elf, who journeys to recover her ten elemental powers and captive family from her evil sister and the troll king. Kameo uses elemental powers to transform into creatures with different abilities, which she switches between to solve puzzles and advance through the in-game world. The player controls the player-character {{with the left}} analog stick, the game's camera view with the right <b>thumbstick,</b> and the character attacks and abilities with the controller's triggers. The Xbox 360 controller's face buttons swap between three active, elemental powers.|$|E
500|$|Sierra {{described}} the game's development as challenging because portable consoles lack the processing power of larger machines. Rebellion {{complained about the}} PSP's lack of a second analog <b>thumbstick,</b> stating that it made creating a usable control scheme challenging. They also stated that because the game's protagonist preferred to work alone, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem would not contain a multiplayer cooperative mode for the single-player campaign, but a [...] "Survival Mode" [...] minigame would be available where two players could work together to fight Aliens. The game had a relatively short development cycle, and was made {{in less time than}} the movie.|$|E
50|$|On April 25, 1997 Sony {{introduced}} the world's first handheld, dual stick controller for a games console. Based {{on the same}} potentiometer technology {{that was used in}} the larger Dual Analog Flightstick, the Sony Dual Analog Controller featured rumble, three modes of analog (Flightstick, Full Analog and Analog-Off), and dual plastic concave <b>thumbsticks.</b>|$|R
50|$|On November 20, 1997, Sony {{released}} {{their third}} analog controller to the market: the DualShock. The controller featured similar twin analog {{sticks to the}} Dual Analog, although they featured convex rubber tips rather than concave plastic ones. Sony also removed the third analog (flightstick) mode and added two new buttons, L3 and R3, under the <b>thumbsticks,</b> {{which could be used}} by pressing down on the sticks.|$|R
50|$|Feedback for {{the game}} has been {{generally}} positive. Two Russian-language gaming sites, itndaily and Канобу, gave it generally positive reviews, while a reviewer at <b>Thumbsticks</b> gave the English-language version a less favorable review following its release on Steam. As of November 2015, the Visual Novel Database gives it an average rating of 7.51 (good) with over 596 votes, and of more than 10,281 Steam users, 94% have given the game a Recommended rating.|$|R
500|$|Ryu's {{movements}} are directed using the console gamepad. The game's control system, which comprises the left <b>thumbstick,</b> two attack buttons, and a block button, {{was described as}} fluid and responsive, and Ninja Gaiden was regarded as {{having one of the}} deeper combat engines among Xbox games at the time, comparing well to the [...] action-adventures God of War and Devil May Cry. Eric Williams, the designer of the God of War combat engine, explained that Ninja Gaiden prohibits players from stopping or changing attacks in mid-stroke. In contrast, God of War allows players to do so, and Devil May Cry grants this freedom to certain attacks. Williams said that, compared to those two games, the combat system in Ninja Gaiden was harder to master; however, it lets players fight their computer controlled foes on equal terms.|$|E
500|$|Rare Replay Nintendo 64 {{emulation}} pleased critics. Ars Technica {{wrote that}} the polygonal upgrades compensated for the [...] "blurry" [...] and [...] "pixelated" [...] source material, though the Nintendo 64 multiplayer modes lacked the frame rate upgrades that their single-player modes received. Kotaku noted that the Xbox One had more Nintendo 64 re-releases than Nintendo's Wii U Virtual Console. Its reviewer found the in-game Xbox One button prompts to be [...] "delightful anachronisms". Ars Technica reviewer commended Rare's choice of the Nintendo 64 version of Conker's Bad Fur Day over its updated but censored Xbox re-release. Initial reviews found Jet Force Gemini unplayable without dual <b>thumbstick</b> controls, which were later added. While Machkovech (Ars Technica) considered Rare's Microsoft games to the weakest of the lot, Whitehead (Eurogamer) found them even more enjoyable {{in the context of}} Rare Replay. Reviewers noted frame rate and technical issues in the Xbox 360 emulation and did not like its separation {{from the rest of the}} compilation. Kollar (Polygon) called the Xbox 360 game installation process needlessly complex, and Marty Sliva (IGN) did not like how the Xbox 360 startup sequence interrupted the compilation's cohesion. He added that the emulated Xbox 360 experience was subpar compared to the unemulated experience.|$|E
500|$|Criticism has befallen Sega's {{management}} regarding {{both the}} creation and handling of the Saturn. McFerran criticizes Sega's management {{at the time of}} the Saturn's development, claiming that it had [...] "fallen out of touch with both the demands of the market and the industry". Bernie Stolar has also been criticized for his decision to end support for the Saturn. According to Fahs, [...] "Stolar's decision to abandon the Saturn made him a villain to many Sega fans, but... it was better to regroup than to enter the next fight battered and bruised. Dreamcast would be Stolar's redemption." [...] Stolar has defended his decision, stating, [...] "I felt Saturn was hurting the company more than helping it. That was a battle that we weren't going to win." [...] Sheffield stated that the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals undermined third-party support for the system, but because [...] "nVidia invested in quads" [...] at the same time there is [...] "a remote possibility" [...] they could have [...] "become the standard instead of triangles"—"if somehow, magically, the Saturn were the most popular console of that era." [...] Speaking more positively of the system, former Working Designs president Victor Ireland described the Saturn as [...] "the start of the future of console gaming" [...] because it [...] "got the better developers thinking and designing with parallel-processing architecture in mind for the first time". Writing for GamesRadar, Justin Towell noted that the Saturn's 3D Pad [...] "set the template for every successful controller that followed, with analog shoulder triggers and left <b>thumbstick...</b> I don't see any three-pronged controllers around the office these days." ...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, analog sticks (or <b>thumbsticks,</b> {{due to their}} being {{controlled}} by one's thumbs) have become standard on controllers for video game consoles, popularized by Nintendo's Nintendo 64 controller, and {{have the ability to}} indicate the stick's displacement from its neutral position. This means that the software does not have {{to keep track of the}} position or estimate the speed at which the controls are moved. These devices usually use potentiometers to determine the position of the stick, though some newer models instead use a Hall effect sensor for greater reliability and reduced size.|$|R
50|$|The Steam Controller {{features}} two high-resolution clickable trackpads (replacing {{the typical}} <b>thumbsticks</b> on modern console controllers), and fourteen buttons, including face, shoulder, and undergrip buttons. The trackpads include haptic feedback, which can send tactile {{feedback to the}} player in reaction to events within the game; Chris Kohler of Wired described using the controller while playing Civilization V at a press event at Valve, and noted that as he used the trackpad to move the mouse cursor, electromagnets within the controller created audio and tactile feedback {{as if he were}} using a trackball. Although the controller is designed for the Steam Machine platform, it can also be used with Steam on existing PCs. The controller also included gyroscopic sensors to detect the relative orientation of the controller.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gameplay}} received mixed responses. Both John Scalzo and the Game Revolution reviewer {{compared the}} gameplay to Donkey Kong Country, with Scalzo describing {{the game as}} having a [...] "familiar, yet unique" [...] quality that he attributed to Naughty Dog's design, while the Game Revolution reviewer concluded that the game [...] "fails to achieve anything really new or revolutionary" [...] as a platform game. The IGN reviewer said that the game [...] "isn't a revolution in platform game design. It's pretty much your standard platform game". However, he noted the game's [...] "surprisingly deep" [...] depth of field and use of different perspectives as exceptions to the platforming formula. Jim Sterling of Destructoid.com stated that the game has aged poorly since its initial release and cited {{the lack of support}} for DualShock <b>thumbsticks,</b> a poor camera as well as substandard jumping and spinning controls.|$|R
2500|$|IGN's Jeremy Dunham {{said of the}} PS2 version, [...] "there isn't much to find {{beyond the}} horrendous {{controls}} and suspiciously bad gameplay." [...] He was critical of the control system, saying [...] "Admirable as the attempt at a new attack system may be, we think that a more traditional method of attack {{would have been a}} better way to go." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, and concluded, [...] "Blade II has turned into our most recent poster child for how NOT to make a movie-licensed videogame." [...] Hilary Goldstein was equally unimpressed with the Xbox version. He too was critical of the combat system, finding it too limiting: [...] "The combat system seems to be begging for more. Chains, grabs, fluidity. But those things are absent. Because you have to use the <b>thumbstick,</b> and because the <b>thumbstick</b> represents the direction of an attack and the attack itself, combat seems very stilted." [...] He was also critical of the story, missions and AI, referring to the game as [...] "a momentary distraction in video game life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of the game's 18-month {{development}} time {{was focused on}} the game's controls and making sure they worked, as Mustard believed that without controls that [...] "feel sweet," [...] the game would have been poorly received. This included the incorporation of weapon aiming through the right <b>thumbstick</b> and other tactical elements such as firing from cover from games such as Gears of War. With the game being published by Microsoft Studios, the development team had access to the Microsoft play testers, who helped to identify other problem areas with their original level design. This also {{led to the development of}} the option to show a blue line on the game's map that would show the player where to go next. Mustard realized there was both a benefit and downside to this feature, as it would help guide players that were stuck, but at the same time, players could become too dependent on the line and follow it exactly, giving them no challenge in exploring the game's world. To counter this, they had the line show the general path that needed to be taken but included parts of their world where the player would be forced to deviate from the suggested path in order to work around an obstacle or collect a required power-up.|$|E
2500|$|Substance {{contains}} several supplemental game modes {{in addition}} to the main story mode from the original Sons of Liberty releases. The main game contains all the changes and additions that were made in the Japanese and European versions of the original release (e.g. Boss Survival, Casting Theater, European Extreme), along with further additional changes. Players can now start the main story mode at the Tanker or Plant chapters without the need to answer a questionnaire first and a new set of collectible dog tags have been added (exclusively on the PS2 version) based on names submitted from a second contest {{in addition to}} the original (2001) set. The visual effect for the thermal goggles were also changed in Substance and the FHM-licensed posters that adorned several locations in the original Sons of Liberty version have been replaced with public domain images (these were also replaced in The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2). The Xbox and PC version feature slight dialogue changes during certain control explanations in which the term [...] "analog stick" [...] was substituted with [...] "thumbstick" [...] (Microsoft's preferred term). The controls were also slightly altered for the Xbox version, due to its fewer shoulder buttons (clicking on the left <b>thumbstick</b> switches between normal and first-person view, while the Y button serves as a lock-on for the player's aim). The Xbox version has support for 5.1 surround sound.|$|E
5000|$|The Steam Controller was {{released}} in November 2015. [...] The Steam Controller was designed by Valve not only for games developed for controllers, but also for games traditionally played with keyboard and mouse controls. It features two high-resolution clickable trackpads (replacing the typical <b>thumbsticks</b> on modern console controllers), sixteen buttons, including face, shoulder, and undergrip buttons, and gyroscopic sensors for motion control. The trackpads include haptic feedback, which can send tactile feedback to the player in reaction to events within the game; Chris Kohler of Wired described using the controller while playing Civilization V at a press event at Valve, and noted that as he used the trackpad to move the mouse cursor, electromagnets within the controller created audio and tactile feedback {{as if he were}} using a trackball.

5000|$|The Xbox version {{received}} [...] "average" [...] reviews {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic. [...] Maxim gave it a score of eight out of ten {{and said that the}} game [...] "earns laurels for putting players in simultaneous control of a driver and a passenger who can use a whip or a sword to turn opponents into Caesar salad." [...] However, The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that it was [...] "fun, but only after you master the steep learning curve. The game is tough to learn because all of its controls — buttons, triggers and <b>thumbsticks</b> — must be used for practically any race." [...] Playboy also gave it a similar score of 70% and said that it [...] "scores points for an original theme coupled with fresh play mechanics. It then promptly loses them to poor execution." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although reviewers {{liked the}} console {{versions}} of the game, they believed there were obvious differences between the PC and console versions.

50|$|Brothers is {{presented}} from a third-person view overlooking the two brothers. The brothers are moved individually by two <b>thumbsticks</b> on the controller. The controller triggers also cause the respective brother {{to interact with}} the game world, such as talking to a non-player character or grabbing onto a ledge or object. The older brother is the stronger of the two and can pull levers or boost his younger brother to higher spaces, while the younger one can pass between narrow bars. The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers {{at the same time to}} complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around). Should either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint. All of the in-game dialogue is spoken in a fictional language based on Lebanese Arabic, thus the story is conveyed through actions, gestures and expressions.|$|R

The Gyroxus, however, is like a giant left <b>thumbstick</b> that a gamer sits in, which allows the gamer to control his or her character's movement with the whole body. This gives the gamer a greater feeling of involvement with the video game character since he or she feels the same motions as the {{character is}} going through on screen.
