The new respondents were specifically targeted to fill segments of the U. S. population that tend <b>to</b> be <b>underbanked</b> and underrepresented in the longitudinal panel. We discuss key differences between the longitudinal panelists and the new members and how those differences could affect certain population estimates. We look at a collection of 54 variables and find that changes in estimates of most variables are not significant. As expected, there is evidence that the improved coverage of individuals who are young, low income, or members of a minority population leads to lower estimates of certain variables most closely related to ownership and use of traditional banking accounts...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} new {{means of}} measuring creditworthiness, reputation and character online and briefly considers {{the implications for}} contemporary art. New technologies for determining creditworthiness abound; for instance, companies in the so-called fintech (financial technology) industry, provide new methods for granting credit <b>to</b> the <b>underbanked,</b> using big data analytics and psychometric testing. Similarly, Rachel Botsman and others envision {{a future in which}} reputation becomes a kind of currency, following its bearers from platform to platform. Together, the world of consciously projected reputation-images online and the fintech industry's inconspicuous measurement of creditworthiness form a conscious/ unconscious couplet of character measurement apparatuses. Character, in these data analytic worlds, acts as a lived fiction, a representation of futurity online that determines in advance one's level of access to markets and social spheres. How might these emerging conditions change the ways in which artworks understand – and perhaps resist – the demand to be " good " characters online? Some possible artistic responses to this world of character measurement include questioning the correlative logics of measurement itself and testing the limits of creditworthy character traits, in order to demonstrate that credit must always rely on a set of locally shared assumptions as to what might be considered " desirable " behaviour...|$|R

S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General suggests the agency could offer financial services, and a University of Georgia faculty member and {{expert on the}} subject, Mehrsa Baradaran, says this could be beneficial <b>to</b> <b>underbanked</b> consumers and those on {{the lower end of}} the socioeconomic scale. Baradaran, an assistant professor in the UGA School of Law, is available to comment on the proposal for the USPS to offer loans and other financial services. She can be contacted Monday-Friday from 8 a. m. - 5 p. m. at 646 - 382 - 2632 or mehrsa@uga. edu. On Jan. 27, the USPS 2 ̆ 7 Office of the Inspector General issued a white paper stating the agency could offer services such as remittances, debit cards, international money orders and transfers, and even small loans in an effort <b>to</b> reach <b>underbanked</b> consumers. By offering these financial services reports estimate that the USPS could raise approximately 8. 9 billion in additional revenue and potentially reach 68 million adults. The report states this move is not meant to make the postal service a competitor to banks but suggests it could partner with financial institutions. Baradaran, who explored a similar direction in an article two years ago and just had an opinion piece published in The New York Times on the topic, said credit unions and savings and loans used to be subsidized by the federal government to provide credit to the poor, but it stopped doing that a few decades ago. 2 ̆ 2 Since then, our government continues to subsidize banks, but those subsidies are not making their way to those who most need banking and credit services, 2 ̆ 2 she said. 2 ̆ 2 This gap of services to the poor is a relatively new phenomenon, and one that I believe the USPS should help to fill. 2 ̆ 2 Based on her article titled 2 ̆ 2 How the Poor Got Cut Out of Banking 2 ̆ 2 published in the Emory Law Journal, Baradaran provides five reasons for this bold move: 1. Location, Location, Location: When mainstream commercial banks and thrifts started facing intense market competition in the 1970 s and 1980 s, they deserted low-income neighborhoods en-masse and basically stopped lending there. This is what the Community Reinvestment Act is meant to address. When the banking establishment left, the fringe banks moved in. In many low-income neighborhoods, payday lenders are the only establishments offering credit. But the local post office still operates in those areas. 2. The local post office is more inviting than a local bank: Among the documented reasons the poor avoid banks is they feel certain race, class and language barriers. They just do not feel comfortable. The post office does not have a stiff formality like most mainstream banks and can overcome some of these cultural barriers because the institution serves a diverse array of customers. 3. Postal banking used to happen in the U. S., and it still happens abroad: President Ulysses S. Grant suggested and President William Howard Taft initiated post office savings accounts in the early 1900 s. The Postal Savings Accounts were created and geared to recent immigrants and the unbanked poor, and they were widely successful. Many other countries currently use their postal service to provide credit and saving services to their citizens, including: Japan, Germany, China, Brazil, Israel, France, Korea, India, South Africa, Kenya and Sri Lanka. 4. Post offices could fill a market gap: A recent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation study found that more than half of the U. S. population cannot access 2, 000 in the event of an emergency and that about 30 percent is either unbanked or underbanked. Currently, most banks do not offer the types of small loans the poor need. If the USPS can offer small loans and other simple transactional services at lower costs, they do not put anyone out of business; they fill a real market need. Additionally, the post office can offer these services at a much lower cost because it would be using its existing infrastructure. 5. The government should facilitate and subsidize access to credit for all people. The U. S. banking system has always been and will always be a heavily subsidized sector. A big justification for these subsidies is that the populace gets something in return. The government supports banks because we need them to provide credit, which allows companies and individuals to improve their economic position. But unfortunately, most of these subsidies (especially in the form of bailouts) flow to the largest banks, which are not serving most of the public. ### Note to editors: The USPS White Paper titled 2 ̆ 2 Providing Non-Bank Financial Services for the Underserved 2 ̆ 2 can be found at: www. uspsoig. gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/ 2014 /rarc-wp- 14 - 007. pdf.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how blockchain technology alters the dynamic within financial services {{and focuses on}} the impact on US financial inclusion. First, I {{provide an overview of}} the financial services industry and the issues associated with financial inclusion. Second, I provide a framework for reviewing blockchains. Lastly, I take an in-depth look at the economics of offering checking accounts, and identify approaches for how blockchains will redefine the value chain in financial services. Blockchain technology brings new avenues for companies within the payments value chain to work more closely together to reduce costs for all parties involved. Banks are leading the way in exploring how blockchains will make them more efficient. By partnering with merchants, banks stand to make the most out of the lower costs to network securely promised by blockchains. In this process, banks set themselves up to offer no-fee checking accounts to all consumers, without taking a loss on each account, as they do today. Banks' ability to profitably offer no-fee checking <b>to</b> unbanked and <b>underbanked</b> customers is the key to increasing financial inclusion in the US, and ultimately across the globe. by Alin S.

40|$|This {{research}} explores and {{identifies the}} various reasons for which informal traders in Cape Town, South Africa, do not adopt mobile payment technology and prefer cash. In the informal economy, a cash preference creates challenges such as financial exclusion (Bromley, 2006; Donner & Tellez, 2008; Blanco et al., 2009; Bick et al., 2009; Kendall et al., 2014). Recently, with the mobile phone's ubiquity, mobile payments {{have emerged as}} one of the ways to enable access <b>to</b> finance for <b>underbanked</b> or unbanked people, primarily because mobile payments are considered low-cost and easy to use (Donovan, 2012; Mbogo, 2010; Maurer, 2012). However, research reflects low adoption of mobile payments in South Africa (Pew Research Centre, 2015). In light of this low adoption, this research is interested in asking: 'Why don't informal traders in Cape Town, South Africa use mobile payment facilities?' This research explores this question through the critical social theory perspective. This qualitative study was conducted in four trading locations in Cape Town's inner city over June to September 2015. Primary data was collected through semi-structured face to face interviews with twenty informal traders, and participant observations. The empirical findings demonstrate that social and cultural factors influence non-adoption. The theoretical contribution made in this paper is the contributes to the development ofmodification of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM, 1989). The modified model places social and cultural factors as central to the determinants of adoption. This modified TAM contributes towards the field of mobile technology acceptance research in South Africa, and is a response to the call for information systems research exploring social and cultural explanations for adoption or non-adoption (Lee, 2003; Bagozzi, 2003; Ventakesh, 2007; Dahlberg et al., 2008; Donner & Tellez, 2008; William et al., 2009; Crabbe et al., 2009; Morawczynski, 2009) ...|$|R
