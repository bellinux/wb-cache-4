40|$|Regulators {{demand the}} {{impossible}} when they require issuers {{to design and}} implement effective insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance</b> programs because insider trading is a crime that neither Congress nor the Securities Exchange Commission has defined with any specificity. This problem of uncertainty is then compounded {{by the threat of}} heavy civil and criminal sanctions for violations. Placed between this rock and hard place, issuers tend to adopt overbroad insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance</b> programs, which comes at a heavy price in terms of corporate culture, cost of compensation, share liquidity, and cost of capital. The irony is that, since all of these costs are ultimately passed along to the shareholders, insider trading enforcement under the current regime has precisely the opposite of its intended effect. This is the paradox of insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance</b> for issuers, just one more symptom of a dysfunctional insider trading enforcement regime that is in need of a dramatic overhaul. There are a number of conceivable paths to resolving this paradox. The most obvious solution would be for the Securities Exchange Commission to issue a rule or for Congress to promulgate a statute defining insider trading with greater specificity. But while simply fixing definitions to the elements of insider trading under the current regime would improve matters, this Article calls for a more radical solution. It suggests that the current enforcement regime be liberalized to permit insider trading where an issuer approves a trade in advance and has disclosed that it permits such trading pursuant to regulatory guidelines. It argues that such reform would lead to a more rational, efficient, and just insider trading enforcement regime. Moreover, by aligning the interests of issuers, shareholders, and regulators, this reform would also offer the most effective solution to the paradox of insider <b>trading</b> <b>compliance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recently the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has {{promoted}} {{the endorsement of}} voluntary industry codes of conduct. The ACCC's 14 October 2003 draft guidelines suggest the endorsement of 'industry best practice' codes separately, but related to, individual <b>trade</b> practices <b>compliance</b> programs. In public submissions, industry groups have identified problems with the ACCC's proposals. In this article, {{it is argued that}} endorsement of voluntary industry codes should not be separated from a commitment to individual <b>trade</b> practices <b>compliance.</b> Codes in themselves are not a compliance solution. In 1994, the Australian Law Reform Commission found that codes of conduct are a form of co-regulation. It also found {{that there needs to be}} a level of mutual commitment to a code from the regulator and its regulated entities. That commitment may be lacking if businesses find that the ACCC's code endorsement process is less rewarding than their own compliance processes. Recent research data suggests that Australian businesses prefer <b>trade</b> practices <b>compliance</b> programs derived from their own compliance culture. Simple obedience by a business to an ACCC endorsed industry code is not consistent with this trend. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|With the {{abolition}} of the NationalWater Commission (NWC) in 2015, there is growing opinion that water has fallen off the national agenda. Since the passing of the Basin Plan 2012 (Cth), and the breaking (for many) of the millennium drought, there has been little public debate. However, water reform continues, with state governments rolling out and embedding the key National Water Initiative (NWI) pillars of water markets, water allocation plans and water regulation.

50|$|With new {{positions}} {{and a growing}} challenge, PPQ established two additional satellite programs: Closing the Los Angeles Marketplace Pathway (CLAMP) and Florida Interdiction and Smuggling Team (FIST). State and Federal officials in the CLAMP program were tasked to detect smuggled fruit-fly host material and close the pathway of that harmful pest. FIST, on the other hand, had objectives much larger in scope. Both programs effectively sealed off pathways for potential exotic pest introductions into the United States. As the organization became more successful, it was recognized into a disparate regulatory force within PPQ and reorganized into the current Smuggling Interdiction and <b>Trade</b> <b>Compliance</b> program.|$|E
50|$|In the marketplace, SITC {{officers}} conduct inspection {{surveys and}} intense <b>trade</b> <b>compliance</b> activities, looking to uncover prohibited or regulated items. This work {{may lead to}} trace backs to the Port of Entry {{in order to identify}} the distributor. Once a smuggling pathway is identified, it is shut down often resulting in civil and/or criminal prosecution, and recalls to safeguard American agriculture. The market place for SITC encompasses major distribution centers, flea markets, animal/plant and insect trade shows, large and small chain stores, roadside vendors and your neighborhood corner store. Lastly, the program has influenced changes in federal regulations in its efforts to regulate trade while promoting outreach and education to the public.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: All Annex B parties but Russia, Australia and USA, have {{ratified}} the Kyoto Protocol so far. It {{is still an}} open question whether Russia will ratify and secure that the Protocol enters into force. This paper therefore analyzes consequences of some proposed alternatives if the Russians decide not to ratify. The paper focuses on two cases where {{a limited number of}} the remaining Annex B parties respond to Russian withdrawal by the establishment of a new "mini-Kyoto" agreement whereby these parties commit themselves to the emission caps, the rules for emissions <b>trading,</b> <b>compliance</b> etc. set out in the Protocol. Environmentally, implementation of the Kyoto Protocol without participation from Russia and Ukraine is obviously superior to implementation with Russian/Ukrainian participation, due to the implied withdrawal of hot air based permits from the market. Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol without Russian/Ukrainian participation will, furthermore, imply higher costs to the remaining countries.
