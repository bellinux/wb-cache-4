Protein KaiA {{enhances the}} phosphorylation of protein KaiC by binding to the A loop of the CII domain to promote auto-kinase activity during subjective day. Phosphorylation at subunits occurs in an ordered manner, beginning with phosphorylation of Threonine 432 (T432) followed by Serine 431 (S431) on the CII domain. This leads to <b>tight</b> <b>stacking</b> of the CII domain to the CI domain. KaiB then binds to the exposed B loop on the CII domain of KaiC and sequesters KaiA from the C-terminals during subjective night, which inhibits phosphorylation and stimulates auto-phosphatase activity.http://www.jbc.org/content/289/31/21267.long Dephosphorylation of T432 occurs followed by S431, returning KaiC {{to its original}} state.|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{thylakoid}} degradation are described, both including leaf bleaching (i. e. chlorophyll degradation) {{and destruction of}} the photosynthetic membranes. The first type of degradation is characterized by coiling of single thylakoids and by cup-shape stacking of grana thylakoids. This type of thylakoid degradation was observed in leaves of the aurea varieties (conditional mutants) of several trees and shrubs. Leaf bleaching and thylakoid damage required strong sun-illumination and was repairable by shading, although only in young, still growing leaves. Astructurally similar type of membrane damage, although not repairable, was detected in wheat and bean leaves treated with cadmium, followed by sun-exposure. The formation of interthylakoidally located membrane coils was not always dependent on strong light; they were also found in plastids of senescing leaves of Sophora japonica. Asecond type of thylakoid degradation appeared {{as the result of}} irreversible damage: leaf bleaching induced by treatment with amitrole, followed by sun-exposure. The damage began with <b>tight</b> <b>stacking</b> of long straight grana thylakoids. Later, on plane and perpendicularly oriented sections of these grana thylakoids, osmiophilic particles with diameters around 8 nm became visible. These were arranged in hexagonal arrays, with an approximate spacing of 12 nm. The possible origin of these regular structures is discussed. Structurally similar substructures in tightly stacked grana thylakoids were also detected in plastids of the subepidermal cells of Cucurbita pepo var. ovifera and pyriformis during fruit ripening, i. e. during the chloroplast-chromoplast transition...|$|E

40|$|Two regioregular {{narrow band}} gap {{conjugated}} polymers with a D’-A-D-A repeat unit architecture, namely PIFCF and PSFCF, were designed and synthesized. Both polymers contain strictly organized fluorobenzo[c][1, 2, 5]thiadiazole (FBT) orientations and different solubilizing side chains for solution processing. Compared to the previously reported asymmetric pyridyl-[2, 1, 3]thiadiazole (PT) based regioregular polymer, namely PIPCP, PIFCF and PSFCF exhibit wider band gaps, <b>tighter</b> π-π <b>stacking,</b> and improved hole mobilities. When incorporated into solar cells with fullerene acceptors, the Eloss = Eg - eVoc values of PIFCF and PSFCF devices are increased compared to solar cells based on PIPCP. Determination of Ect in these solar cells reveals that, relative to PIPCP, PIFCF solar cells lose more energy from Eg - Ect, and PSFCF solar cells lose more energy from both Eg - Ect and Ect - eVoc.

40|$|Three {{types of}} semi-crystalline {{photovoltaic}} polymers were synthesized by incorporating a siloxane-terminated organic/inorganic hybrid side-chain {{and changing the}} number of fluorine substituents. A branch point away from a polymer main backbone in the siloxane-containing side-chains and the intra- and/or interchain noncovalent coulombic interactions enhance a chain planarity and facile interchain organization. The resulting polymers formed strongly agglomerated films with high roughness, suggesting strong intermolecular interactions. The optical band gap of ca. 1. 7 eV was measured for all polymers with a pronounced shoulder peak due to <b>tight</b> π-π <b>stacking.</b> With increasing the fluorine substituents, the frontier energy levels decreased and preferential face-on orientation was observed. The siloxane-terminated side-chains and fluorine substitution promoted the intermolecular packing, showing well resolved lamellar scatterings up to (300) for this series of polymers in the grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering measurements. The PPsiDTBT, PPsiDTFBT and PPsiDT 2 FBT devices showed a power conversion efficiency of 3. 16 %, 4. 40 % and 5. 65 %, respectively, by blending with PC 71 BM. Langevin-type bimolecular charge recombination was similar for three polymeric solar cells. The main loss in the photocurrent generation for PPsiDTBT:PC 71 BM was interpreted to originate from the trap assisted charge recombination by measuring light-intensity dependent short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Our results provide a new insight into the rational selection of solubilizing substituents for optimizing crystalline interchain packing with appropriate miscibility with PC 71 BM for further optimizing polymer solar cells. clos...|$|R

The other two linemen could either attack upfield or hold their single gap like the flexed linemen and wait for the ball to come to them. These concepts of shooting the gap and shoot and hold the gap are integral parts of today's more modern versions of the 4-3 which include the Tampa 2 scheme, the Seattle Seahawks shoot and hold defense and the 4-3 slide.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of two parts – a detailed experimental investigation on the activity of supported threonine aldolase {{for use in a}} microreactor/flow reactor and a generic, explorative outline on potential productivity of enzymatic microreactors; with the need to use data from other enzymes here as well. Threonine aldolase was immobilized on different supports foreseen to be coated or packed within the micro- and millichannels of flow reactors. As enzyme supports, an innovative high-surface area and high-porosity silica (Nanosprings), the commercial Eupergit CM, and polymer membrane materials were used. For Eupergit CM, the share of chemically fixed enzymes and active enzymes were within the reported literature performance for enzyme immobilization. The values of immobilized enzymes on Nanosprings were somewhat lower. However, this is overcompensated by the larger specific surface area of Nanosprings and the availability of a new, second generation flow reactor concept, which involves a <b>tight</b> packing of <b>stacked</b> Nanosprings disks. For the investigated membranes, the density of immobilized enzymes was close to the reported value of capacity. From these experimental results, calculations on (maximally achievable) productivity of microreactors were made. This was combined with results of glucose oxidase immobilization on Nanosprings. The objective was to achieve high enzyme loadings to obtain reasonable space–time yields to ensure cost-effectiveness of the derived chemical reaction processes. These productivities were benchmarked to industrial production needs for two processes – a high-value pharmaceutical intermediate synthesis (towards chiral amino alcohols, using threonine aldolase) and a large-volume fine-chemical synthesis (the gluconic acid synthesis, using glucose oxidase), including suggestions for reactor scale-up. This shows that the present loading performance suffices in the case of high-value products, such as pharmaceuticals, but not for larger-volume, low-cost chemicals; at least under best-performance assumptions such as the avoidance of mass-transfer limitations...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of donor and/or {{acceptor}} molecules have been produced {{for the development of}} novel molecular conductors so far. Many organic conductors have columnar structures, where the conduction pathways are formed by intracolumnar and intercolumnar contacts. The dimensionality of the system is determined by the anisotropy of these interactions. The one-dimensional conductor has a tendency to show metal-insulator transition at low temperature. Therefore, it is very important in the molecular design to develop multi-dimensional band structure. The main purpose of this thesis is to produce novel types of molecular conductors on the basis of newly synthesized donors. The present thesis is composed of eight chapters. In Chapter 1, as an introduction, the author described the history of organic molecular conductors. In Chapter 2, a novel pentathio-substituted donor 1 was treated. The neutral molecules have the two-dimensional network through sulfur atoms between the pentathio groups and TTF moieties. The CIO 4 - salt has no intermolecular S…S contact between the donor columns owing to the anions and crystal solvents located between them, however, there are several short intermolecular contacts mediated by the sulfur atoms of TTF moieties in the dimer. This salt is semiconductor with an activation energy of 0. 11 - 0. 13 eV and room temperature electrical conductivity is comparatively high (3. 7 x 10 - 2 - 3. 8 ｘ 10 - 1 S･cm- 1) for 1 : 1 salt because of its <b>tight</b> one-dimensional <b>stacking.</b> In Chapter 3, the first synthesis and structure of a novel cyclophane-like bridged TTF dimer 2 was described. The TTF dimer shows two pairs of reversible one-electron redox waves and one pair of reversible two-electron redox wave, suggesting the existence of intradimer interaction between two TTF moieties. The electrical property of its CIO 4 - salt was insulating because of the dicationic state of the donors and its undesirable crystal structure. In Chapter 4, the crystal structure and electrochemical properties of a novel unsymmetrical donor containing pyrazino-ring, PEDTTSeF, were investigated. The BF 4 -, CIO 4 -, GaCl 4 -, PF 6 - and AsF 6 - salts showed metallic behavior down to low temperature and several of them show metal-insulator transitions. The BF 4 - and CIO 4 - salts have the unique donor arrangement resembling to β"-like structure and 2 : 1 composition of donor-to-anion. They stack in the zig-zag manner with periods of three lavers of donors, giving a six-periodic sigmoidal stacking and there is, thus, no distinct column in the crystal. Furthermore there are many short intermolecular contacts and two-dimensional networks. The paramagnetic susceptibility of the BF 4 - salt is almost constant throughout the temperature range of 300 - 2 K, indicating the Pauli paramagnetism of the metal electrons. Chapter 5 treated the electrical and magnetic properties of to κ-(BETS) 2 FeBr 4. The physical properties of κ-(BETS) 2 FwBr 4 showed this system to be the first antiferromagnetic organic metal at ambient pressure (T N = 2. 5 K). This salt showed metamagnetic behavior when the magnetic field is applied to the direction parallel to the a-axis, the magnetization increases very rapidly and tends to be saturated around 30 kOe. The small resistivity drop observed at T N clearly showed the existence of the interaction between n metal electrons and localized magnetic moments. In addition, this system undergoes a superconducting transition at about 1. 1 K. That is, κ-(BETS) 2 FeBr 4 is the first antiferromagnetic organic metal exhibiting a superconducting transition below Neel temperature. Furthermore, estimated GL coherent lengths suggest that the superconductivity in this system is strongly anisotropic similar to the cases of BEDT-TTF based organic superconductors. The λ-type large peak of specific heat was also observed, suggesting the bulk antiferromagnetic transition of high-spin Fe 3 + ions. It is strongly indicated that the surerconductivity and the magnetic order coexist below T N. In κ-(BETS) 2 FeCl X Br 4 -X systems, the Neel temperature shifts to lower temperature with the increase of chlorine contents. Moreover, the direction of an easy spin axis is changed from the a-axis to the b-axis in the sample with Cl≧ 1. 2. On the other hand, the broad peak of the electrical resistivity at 60 K, which is observed in to κ-(BETS) 2 FeBr 4, was suppressed with increasing chlorine contents. Furthermore, the temperature corresponding to the small drop of resistivities was in good agreement with the Neel temperatures and shifted to lower temperature with the increase of the chlorine contents. On the other hand, the critical temperature of superconductivity shifts to lower temperature with the increase of the chlorine contents and appeared at 0. 7 K in the samrle of Cl = 0. 1. In the case of κ-(BETS) 2 FeCl 0. 5 Br 3. 5, a slight decrease of resistivity was observed below 0. 7 K. Chapter 6 treated the structures and physical properties of a newly synthesized telluro-cycle fused donor 3. The TCNQ complex and the cation radical salts were studied. The CV result of neutral molecule showed three pairs ofreversible redox waves. In the repeated cycling between 0. 0 V and 1. 5 V (higher than a shoulder peak around 1. 4 V), only the third redox waves were gradually extinguished. The TCNQ complex showed semiconducting behavior because of its mixed-stacking structure. All the salts prepared using the telluro-cycle fused donor 3 by an electrochemical oxidation were composed of the symmetrically dimerized donor 4. Such a dimerization at the tellurium atoms could be conducted by the high oxidation state produced during the electrochemical oxidation. The obtained cation radical salts were also semiconductors with very small activation energies of 0. 03 - 0. 06 eV. Their room temperature electrical conductivities were relatively high (1 - 10 S･cm- 1), because of the <b>tight</b> one-dimensional <b>stacking</b> in regard of the Au(CN) 2 - salt. In Chapter 7, the crystal structures and physical properties of various cation radical salts of TMTTeN were examined. In (TMTTeN) 2 M(CN) 2 (M = Ag and Au), the crystal structure analyses and tight-binding band calculations indicate these systems to be quasi three-dimensional conductors. The salts are highly conductive (720 - 760 S･cm- 1) and keep the metallic states down to ca. 50 K. Furthermore, Ag(CN) 2 - salt exhibited constant Pauli paramagnetic behavior down to 2 K. In TMTTeN(SCN) 0. 88, the donor molecules are stacked to form columns and three-dimensional network is developed through the intermolecular Te…Te contacts between columns. The salt is highly conductive (590 S･cm- 1) and keep the metallic behavior down to liquid helium temperature. Furthermore, the paramagnetic susceptibility of TMTTeN(SCN) 0. 88 is almost constant throughout the temperature range, indicating Pauli paramagnetism of the system. The Fermi surface of the SCN- salt is open along the b* and c* directions, however, the intermolecular interactions between the donor columns are not so weak due to the three-dimensional network mediated by the protruded tellurium. In Chapter 8, the author described the conclusion of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Vibrio cholerae are Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{responsible for}} cholera, a severe and fatal gastrointestinal disease. The ability of V. cholerae {{and many other}} bacterial pathogens to cause disease is dependent on type IV pili. V. cholerae use toxin-coregulated pili (TCP) to colonize the human intestine. TCP are long, thin, flexible polymers of the TcpA subunit that self-associate to hold cells together in microcolonies, serve as the receptor for the cholera toxin bacteriophage CTXφ and secrete colonization factor proteins. To better understand TCP’s roles in pathogenesis, its structure was characterized using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, computational modeling, electron microscopy (EM) and three-dimensional image reconstruction. The V. cholerae TcpA pilin crystal structure was docked into the pilus EM reconstruction to generate a pseudo-atomic resolution TCP structure. Tight packing of the hydrophobic N-terminal α-helices holds the pilin subunits together, but loose packing of the globular domains leaves gaps on the filament surface. These findings explain filament flexibility, suggest a molecular basis for pilus:pilus interactions and reveal a potential therapeutic target. TCP {{are members of the}} type IVb pilus subclass, which is distinguished from the type IVa subclass by differences in amino acid sequence, length and topology of the pilin globular domains. To understand the biological significance of the distinct pilin folds, circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to compare the stability of the V. cholerae type IVb TCP with that of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae type IVa gonococcal (GC) pilus together with their pilin counterparts. We show that TcpA pilin monomers are more stable than GC pilins but surprisingly GC pili are more stable than TCP filaments. Thus, while the type IVb pilin fold appears to be more stable than the type IVa fold, differences in quaternary structures, including <b>tighter</b> packing and <b>stacking</b> of aromatic side chains appear to contribute to the extreme stability of the GC pili. The robustness of GC pili may be necessary to withstand high stress forces in the urogenital tract.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 As lumber {{producers}} {{are faced with}} a diminished and increasingly expensive raw material, the need to maximize resource recovery will increase. Trim-ends (particularly from waned boards) often contain some of the highest quality wood in any given log and lack functionality only in length. This waste, traditionally chipped for pulp, can be finger-jointed into lumber if the material can be dried properly for gluing. This research explores how different length submerchantable pieces dry relative to each other and merchantable lumber when subjected to typical commercial drying schedules as well as how trim-ends in two different charge configurations perform in a conventional dry kiln. Sixteen -foot long, Douglas-fir boards in nominal four, six and eight inch widths were used to produce simulated trim-ends in 0. 5 -, 1. 0 -, 1. 5 -, 2. 0 -, 2. 5 - and 3. 5 -foot lengths. Eight-foot-long boards were also dried as a comparison to the simulated trimends. One course of each width was <b>stacked</b> <b>tight</b> while a second was stacked with a 0. 375 inch space between the ends of the blocks. Four charges were dried using United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommended schedules for high and low grade Douglas-fir. Eight by four foot, self stickered aluminum racks with slots corresponding to each of the sampled widths and a wire-mesh box (random piled), loaded with actual trim-ends and subjected to the USDA low-grade Douglas-fir schedule, were compared. Although it was demonstrated that length affects the final moisture content of pieces with similar anatomy and initial moisture content, it is not a significant factor in determining the mean final moisture content of the average charge of short blocks. Using the methods in this experiment, sorting by length would not be necessary. Current commercial kiln schedules are likely in appropriate for drying short pieces. An applicable schedule should be developed using real time moisture content monitoring in the kiln (i. e. load-cells). Providing a space between blocks can significantly accelerate the drying rate of fresh lumber and may have a greater effect when combined with an appropriate kiln schedule. The aluminum racks and the wire-mesh box exhibited comparable final moisture content deviation when used to dry trim-ends. The space efficiency of the wire-mesh box was it primary disadvantage and was approximately 63 percent that of the aluminum racks...|$|R
