5|$|Although {{combat in}} the game follows a {{strictly}} turn-based formula, the turn sequence of the characters you have are calculated based on the speed statistic of the character, {{and in some cases}} characters are allowed to strike before enemies can act if <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> sufficient speed. Different attacks can take varied periods of time to execute.|$|E
5|$|Galka: A hulking race of {{powerful}} warriors, the Galka's capital city {{was destroyed by}} war 600 years ago. Many of the surviving Galka settled in Bastok, and are currently used by the city as cheap underclass labour.

The Galka are cursed with rage.|$|E

In the Transformers franchise, Tarantulas and Blackarachnia are both Predacons that turn into giant spiders. Blackarachnia, being part biological, has venom that paralyzes other Transformers and she is capable of spinning webs.|$|E

Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.|$|E
5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> compound eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the more}} unusual {{proposals}} are that the Eskaya people are a Semitic proto-Christian tribe; that <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> the lost book of Enoch; that they are descended from the builders of King Solomon's temple; that their existence proves the imminence of a second Messiah in Bohol; or that they guard esoteric secrets.|$|E

5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{primitive}} order and members do not extrude their stomach when feeding, lack an anus {{and have no}} suckers on their tube feet. Papulae are plentiful on their aboral surface and <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> marginal plates and paxillae. They mostly inhabit soft-bottomed areas of sand or mud. There is no brachiolaria stage in their larval development. The comb starfish (Astropecten polyacanthus) {{is a member of}} this order.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E

5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>possess</b> {{a unique}} feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their oral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what <b>they</b> <b>possess,</b> and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rockâ€“paperâ€“scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills <b>they</b> <b>possess,</b> and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates â€“ destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion â€“ at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Medusae {{and complex}} {{swimming}} colonies such as siphonophores and chondrophores sense tilt and acceleration {{by means of}} statocysts, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing {{the strength of the}} swimming movements on the side that is too low. Most species have ocelli ("simple eyes"), which can detect sources of light. However the agile Box Jellyfish are unique among Medusae because <b>they</b> <b>possess</b> four kinds of true eyes that have retinas, corneas and lenses. Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.|$|E
