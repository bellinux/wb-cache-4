50|$|In the {{description}} of burgage tenure and <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> <b>villeinage,</b> the life of which consists in the validity of ancient customs recognised by law, we recognise survivals of a time before the iron rule of feudalism had moulded the law {{of land in the}} interests of the king and the great lords. Finally he deals with the law of rents, discussing the various kinds of rents that may be reserved to the grantor upon a grant of lands and the remedies for recovery of rent, especially the remedy by distress.|$|E
50|$|A chiefage, or chevage, {{according}} to Henry de Bracton, was a tribute by the head; or {{a kind of}} poll-money paid by those who held lands <b>in</b> <b>villeinage,</b> or otherwise, to their lords, in acknowledgement.|$|R
50|$|Villeinage was {{not always}} an {{involuntary}} arrangement. In the early Middle Ages families entered villeinage voluntarily, to guarantee tenure of land. And while villeins were heavily restricted in what they could do, it was also {{possible for them to}} gain manumission. Many villeins were <b>in</b> <b>villeinage</b> because of the land they held, rather than by birth, and could become free men if their lord agreed with them to move them to a different holding.|$|R

5000|$|The {{village of}} Onley has no mention in any records yet {{discovered}} until 1272 and was {{presumed to be}} included under entries for Barby in taxation records before this date. In 1272 the village was recorded as being {{in the possession of}} George de Cantelupe along with the manor of Barby. The entry records that ‘Virgates [...] <b>in</b> <b>villeinage</b> [...] are valued at 9 shilling per annum’. Records in 1345 make reference to ‘Tenements in Onle’, which may imply that at that time the village was still viable. There is no further record of Onley until {{the early part of the}} 18th century when the village was described as only a hamlet of seven shepherds' houses, which implies that the site had become pasture land for sheep. Records of 1841 show that 19 people lived on the site of Onley in five scattered farms which still exist on the land to this day.|$|R

30|$|To {{summarize}} {{our results}} about the returns to {{different types of}} specific human capital, we find a strong return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the formal sector, but no significant return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the informal sector. Our estimates of 10 -year returns to employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure indicate that formal sector tenure matters more than other specific human capital, namely employer or occupation <b>tenure.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the strong return to formal sector tenure, we find significant returns to potential experience with and without controlling for sector tenure, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings in the literature.|$|R
