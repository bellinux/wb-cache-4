40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to describe the students’ problems in learning English conversation class as the extra curricular activity at Madrasah Aliyah Maarif Sukorejo, Pasuruan. Descriptive qualitative research {{was used as the}} design of this study to collect all information to answer the problems. The population research of this study was second year students that contains of 15 students and one English teacher. The data were obtained through the unstructered interview for English teacher and mix questionnaire for the students which were presented descriptively after being classified into related aspects. The result of this study shows that the students face some problems. First <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> inhibition <b>was</b> <b>that</b> students felt ashame if they got attention when they were speaking English. Second, some problems <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> nothing to say <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the students have not any idea to express their opinion when they are learning speaking. Third, some problems <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> low or uneven participation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the students felt less in participation when they are learning speaking. Fourth, some problems <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> mother tongue use was as follows, students were afraid of criticisms by their friend in speaking class. The causes of the problems were, first the causes <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> inhibition <b>was</b> <b>that</b> students felt ashame if they got attention because they thought that they became centre of attention in the class. Second, the cause <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> nothing to say <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the students had not any idea because the students did not master the material. Third, the cause <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> low or un-even participation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> students less in participation because teacher explains about tenses. The last, the cause <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> mother tongue use <b>was</b> <b>that</b> students felt afraid of criticism by their friends because they would be regarded as cleverer than others...|$|R

5|$|Not {{only are}} groups useful {{to assess the}} {{implications}} of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.|$|E

5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the genes of the viruses.|$|E

5|$|Tarbosaurus bataar was {{originally}} {{described as a}} species of Tyrannosaurus, an arrangement that has been supported by some more recent studies. Others prefer to keep the genera separate, while still recognizing them as sister taxa. A 2003 cladistic analysis based on skull features instead identified Alioramus as the closest known relative of Tarbosaurus, as the two genera share skull characteristics <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> stress distribution and that are not found in other tyrannosaurines. If proven, this relationship would argue against Tarbosaurus becoming a synonym for Tyrannosaurus and would suggest that separate tyrannosaurine lineages evolved in Asia and North America. The two known specimens of Alioramus, which show juvenile characteristics, are not likely juvenile individuals of Tarbosaurus because of their much higher tooth count (76 to 78 teeth) and their unique row of bony bumps {{along the top of}} their snouts.|$|E

Once a song is unlocked in a tier at any difficulty, it is available for the quick play, competitive, and co-operative modes.|$|E
