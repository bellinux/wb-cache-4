5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the bridge}} sequence, Minogue and Fletcher park {{in front of}} a shop, and Minogue seductively tries <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> cashier outside by staring and posing at him, while Fletcher tries to steal money from the till. In the last scenes, Minogue is in another outfit trying to walk out of an alley with a bag of money, but sees a police car driving towards her and tries to walk off. Fletcher is caught by police and is escorted into the police car while yelling at Minogue. Minogue, who see the alteration, drives off with the money and looks back at Fletcher while driving down the street.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April, the Grand Fleet {{conducted}} a demonstration off Horns Reef <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south {{in response to}} intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the Germans had withdrawn, however. On 24 May, the fleet {{conducted a}}nother demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding {{one of their own}} appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a {{standard}} match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when {{he was able to}} execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won the match after Guerrero was disqualified for hitting him with a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|The second phase, {{scheduled}} to begin on 23 August, was to capture Bapaume and then advance further east to Reincourt-les-Bapaume and Bancourt-Fremicourt and the high ground beyond. The New Zealanders were to play a key role; the 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigades of the New Zealand Division, kept in reserve, were {{to be ready to}} exploit any breakthrough on the front. <b>To</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Germans from the main attack being carried out by the Third Army, the French Tenth Army conducted diversionary attacks to the south.|$|E

5|$|The semifinals of the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament followed, {{beginning}} with Team 3D pitted against Cage and Rhino {{in the sixth}} encounter. The bout lasted ten minutes. Before the contest, the TNA commentators announced that Booker T's attack on Cage and Rhino had caused them to have concussions in the storyline. During the contest, Team 3D associate Johnny Devine came to the ring and handed Ray a kendo stick without the referee's knowledge. Although Rhino tackled Devon and went for the cover, Devine entered the ring <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> referee, allowing Ray to hit Rhino with the kendo stick and cover to win the contest for his team.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, rumors spread that Dunder Mifflin is in serious financial trouble, so Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tries <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> office by having everyone play a murder mystery game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) uses the game as a way to ask out Erin (Ellie Kemper), but fears he may have asked out Erin's character, instead of Erin herself.|$|E
5|$|With the {{progression}} of the plans, the enhanced A Company was tasked with planning for {{an assault on the}} village of Magbeni, to the south of Rokel Creek, while the SAS would aim to release the captive Royal Irish soldiers by assaulting Gberi Bana, on the north bank. The Magbeni assault had several purposes: to neutralise weapons in the village which could disrupt the SAS operation, <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana, to defeat the West Side Boys and destroy their military capabilities, and to recover the Royal Irish patrol's vehicles.|$|E

5|$|As {{their journey}} continues, the Kushan fleet gives {{sanctuary}} to the Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his help, they rally a rebellion <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Taiidan fleets. He aids them in penetrating the Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet {{led by the}} Taiidan emperor. During the final battle, the emperor manages to knock S'jet into a coma, but the combined Kushan and rebel fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, a lush world {{in contrast to the}} desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make landfall, the awakened Karan insists to be the last one to set foot on the planet.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rebel}} {{victory at the}} Battle of Rijmenam in July 1578, much of the Southern Netherlands were lost to the Spanish Army during the autumn; Brussels was menaced, and the States General were moved to the safer Antwerp. Taking {{advantage}} of the Dutch rebel army's indiscipline, Farnese decided {{at the beginning of}} 1579 to besiege Maastricht. As a feint <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Dutch rebels from his goal, but also aiming to scare Antwerp's inhabitants, Farnese moved with his troops to surprise the village of Borgerhout, very close to Antwerp, where a part of the Dutch States Army had its quarters, namely 3,000 or 4,000 infantry which were the backbone of the rebel army and consisted of French Calvinists under François de la Noue, and English and Scottish troops under John Norrey's orders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spanish Civil War, Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement. Among these were the distraction it provided from German re-militarisation; the prevention of the spread of communism to Western Europe; {{the creation of a}} state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France; and the possibilities for economic expansion. Although the offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937, a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas was supported by Germany; despite prolonging the Civil War, it would help <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> other western powers from Hitler's ambitions in central Europe. The offensive on Vizcaya, a mining and industrial centre, would help fuel German industry. On 27 June 1937, Hitler (in a speech at Wurzburg) declared he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{the heir}} to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo; the {{assassination}} sparked the July Crisis and ultimately the First World War, which broke out a month later on 28 July. The German battlecruiser , which had been assigned to the Mediterranean Division, sought the protection of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and so Admiral Anton Haus sent the fleet, including Kaiser Karl VI, south on 7 August to assist his German ally. Goebens commander, Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, intended to use the Austro-Hungarian move as a feint <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> British Mediterranean Fleet which was pursuing Goeben; Souchon instead took his ship to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. Their decoy mission complete, Kaiser Karl VI {{and the rest of the}} fleet returned to port without engaging any British forces.|$|E
5|$|Re-designated as Task Force 11, and {{reinforced}} by four destroyers, Lexington and her consorts steamed from Pearl Harbor {{the next day}} to raid the Japanese base on Jaluit in the Marshall Islands <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Japanese from the Wake Island relief force led by Saratoga. For this operation, Lexington embarked 21 Buffalos, 32 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers, although not all aircraft were operational. Vice Admiral William S. Pye, acting commander of the Pacific Fleet, canceled the attack on 20 December and ordered the Task Force northwest to cover the relief force. The Japanese, however, landed on Wake and forced it to surrender on 23 December before Saratoga and her consorts could get there. Pye, reluctant to risk any carriers against a Japanese force of unknown strength, ordered both task forces to return to Pearl.|$|E

At the beginning of August, the ship participated in Operation Stab, a decoy invasion of the Andaman Islands <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Japanese when the Americans were invading the island of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific. Captain Robert Cunliffe relieved Talbott on 22 August. On 10 September the carrier covered the amphibious landing that opened Operation Streamline Jane, the occupation of the remainder of Madagascar, and the landing at Tamatave eight days later, but no significant resistance was encountered and her aircraft were not needed. For this operation she had aboard 6 Fulmars of 806 Squadron, 12 Martlets of 881 Squadron and 18 Swordfish of 810 and 829 Squadrons.|$|E

5|$|That night, a {{force of}} around 300 Japanese who had been falling back since they had run into the 61st Infantry Battalion on Stephen's Ridge, {{encountered}} positions manned by the 2/12th and 9th Infantry Battalions around the Gama River. In a surprise attack, the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese. After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed. Following this the Japanese began to employ infiltration techniques {{in an attempt to}} pass through the numerous listening posts that had been set up {{along the side of the}} track which formed the front of one side of the 2/12th's position. Elsewhere, at the mission, starting at around 8:00pm, they carried out harassment operations in an effort <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Australians and assist their comrades to try to break through the Australian positions from the Gama River. This lasted throughout the night.|$|E
5|$|The 2002–03 {{season was}} Linden's first full {{season with the}} Canucks since 1996–97, though Linden sprained his knee in the season opener and had to miss two weeks.

As {{he did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> team from the playoff race, Linden asked for the ceremony to be delayed. On November 25, 2002, against the Minnesota Wild, Linden scored his 263rd goal with the Canucks, breaking former captain Stan Smyl's team record for most goals. He finished the year with 19 goals and 22 assists for 41 points, his highest goal total in seven seasons, and his highest points total since 1998–99.|$|E
5|$|The British and Egyptian governments {{would not}} again attempt major {{intervention}} until 1896, whereupon {{the government in}} Britain was impelled to act by several factors. The Egyptian economy had improved since British administrators commandeered the country's finances. Public sentiment towards Mahdist Sudan had been stoked by several embellished accounts of the Mahdists' savagery {{and the desire to}} avenge General Charles Gordon. France, Britain's longtime competitor in the Scramble for Africa, was beginning to encroach upon the Nile river valley, alongside the Belgians. Finally, it was politically advantageous in Europe for Britain <b>to</b> <b>distract</b> <b>the</b> Khalifa from the Italians in Eritrea, who had been made vulnerable by a recent defeat at the hands of Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia. The government chose Herbert Horatio Kitchener to lead the new expedition, outfitting him with around ten-thousand soldiers and Britain's latest technology: Maxim guns, heavy artillery, and a small fleet of gunboats.|$|E
