5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{period of}} the Pax Mongolica {{was a result of}} a number of factors, these being incompetent and rivalling leaders, corruption, revolts, decadence, {{factional}} struggles, assassinations, external attacks, and disease. <b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pax Mongolica resulted in a decline of eased trade between East and West.|$|E

5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led to <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Overhill towns.

40|$|It {{has been}} known that some solar {{activity}} indicators show a double-peak feature in their evolution through a solar cycle, which is not conspicuous in sunspot number. In this letter, we investigate the high solar dynamic activity in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunspot cycle by examining <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> polar and low latitude coronal hole areas and <b>the</b> statistics <b>of</b> splitting and merging events of coronal holes and coronal mass ejections detected by SOHO/LASCO C 3 in solar cycle 23. Although the total coronal hole area is at its maximum near the sunspot minimum, in which polar coronal holes prevail, it shows a comparable second maximum in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle, in which low latitude coronal holes are dominant. <b>The</b> events <b>of</b> coronal hole splitting or merging, which are attributed to surface motions of magnetic fluxes, are also mostly populated in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle. The far-reaching C 3 coronal mass ejections are also over-populated in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle. From these results we suggest that solar dynamic activities due to <b>the</b> horizontal motions <b>of</b> magnetic fluxes extend far in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunspot cycle...|$|R

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of {{the quality}} {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding {{and had to be}} built up again over the following centuries.

5|$|Fleetwood {{continued}} to grow without its principal investor, albeit slowly. As a port, it soon faced competition from Lytham and Preston. In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood {{on their way to}} London from Scotland, but that year saw <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were now able to travel over hilly terrain, and the railway was extended over Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer needed as a sea link.|$|E

The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prestige of Meccans. Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.|$|E
