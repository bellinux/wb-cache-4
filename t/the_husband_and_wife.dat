5|$|In Muslim families, {{women and}} men are {{considered}} equal, {{but not in the}} westernised sense. The Quran teaches that the minds of males and females work differently and are generally different biologically. Therefore, Islam grants different rights to <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife.</b> One such right which the wife owes to her husband is being head of the household.|$|E

5|$|Peter Jackson and wife/co-writer Fran Walsh {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} The Frighteners in 1992, during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Together, they wrote a three-page film treatment {{and sent it to}} their talent agent in Hollywood. Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt (which he helped produce). Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993. <b>The</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> duo completed their first draft for The Frighteners in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided The Frighteners would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures. Universal greenlighted the film to commence pre-production on a $26 million budget in April 1994. The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege.|$|E

25|$|The consanguine {{family is}} {{the first stage of}} the family and as such a primary {{indicator}} of our superior nature in comparison with animals.

25|$|Celestial {{marriage}} is {{an instance of}} the LDS Church doctrine of sealing.

25|$|Merezhkovsky's major {{literary}} debut {{came with}} the publication of Poems (1883–1888). It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but – even coupled with Protopop Avvacum, a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of.

Meanwhile, Andree is also very open to having things proceed further with Henry, and the two head back to his hotel suite. As they do, McKenzie takes Helen back to her suite. There, things heat up between the two, and he asks her to go away {{with him when he}} sets sail.|$|E
25|$|Social {{views on}} {{domestic}} violence vary {{from person to}} person, and from region to region, but in many places outside the West, the concept is very poorly understood. This is because {{in most of these}} countries the relation between <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> is not considered one of equals, but instead one in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries – for example, in Yemen, marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.|$|E
25|$|If {{the wife}} was captured, the husband was {{required}} by the Talmud and later writers to pay the ransom demanded for her release; there is some debate whether the husband was required only to pay up to the wife's market value as a slave, or whether he must pay any ransom, {{even to the point}} of having to sell his possessions to raise the funds. If <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> were both taken captive, the historic Jewish view was that the rabbinic courts should first pay the ransom for the wife, selling some of the husband's property in order to raise the funds.|$|E

25|$|Other {{approaches}} {{that have been}} discussed by religious leaders, including leading orthodox rabbis, have included the possibility of prenuptial agreements, not incorporated into the ketubah or mentioned in the words recited by the groom during the ceremony, through which <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> agree to abide by orders of a designated Beth Din, regarding the giving or acceptance of a get. Rabbi Jechiel Perr discussed such a proposal, {{and it has been}} reported that Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, looked upon this idea with favor. Additionally, discussions have considered the possibility of various forms of coercion that could be applied to the husband, to compel him to grant the Get.|$|E
25|$|The words {{represent}} the sociolinguistic dimension and are {{understood as a}} function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife</b> in terms of facial expression, body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood {{as a function of}} behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} cash transfers and food stamp benefits on family labor supply and welfare participation among two-parent families. The Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Unemployed Parent Program has been providing cash benefits to two-parent households since 1961 and recent congressional action has increased its importance. In this model, <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife's</b> labor supply decisions are constrained by a family budget constraint which is non-convex due to features of the AFDC-UP program. <b>The</b> <b>husband's</b> <b>and</b> <b>wife's</b> labor supply decisions are restricted to no work, part-time work and full-time work. Features of the tax and transfer programs are modeled formally using kinked budget restraints. Maximum likelihood techniques are used to estimate parameters of the underlying hours of work and welfare participation equations. The estimates from the model are {{used to determine the}} magnitude of the work disincentive effects of the AFDC-UP program, and to simulate the effects of changes in AFDC-UP benefit and eligibility rules on family labor supply and welfare participation. The results suggest that labor supply and welfare participation among two-parent families are highly responsive to changes in the benefit structure under the AFDC-UP program. ...|$|R
