This study analyzed the long term changes on C. edentulus catches in Guanabara Bay, focusing especially on temporal variation on capture effort, boat storage temperature, and fish price and size. We assessed the 2002 - 2011 database of fish landings at the pier of Rubi S. A., with records of year, month, <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> (<b>kg),</b> number of fish per kg, boat storage temperature (oC), and price per kg to boat owner (US$). Those variables differed among years and months (ANOVA; p< 0. 01) with strong yearXmonth interactions for all, probably related to C. edentulus reproductive and recruitment seasons and environmental conditions of Guanabara Bay. Generalized additive models revealed that high C. edentulus catches were associated withfew boat loadings of large-sized fishes, which were conserved in higher boat storage temperatures and attained high market prices. Our long-term study stressed that variations on C. edentulus fishery were related to changes on boat storage temperature, fish size, price paid per kg, and frequency of landings, and that these descriptors are correlated with C. edentulus ecological traits and high phytoplankton availability. Nevertheless, further studies should be performed to address whether less evident factors, such as the fluctuation of concurrent Sardinella brasiliensis stock, would explain the temporal dynamics of C. edentulus stocks in Guanabara Bay.

40|$|Ninety-three {{species of}} bony fishes {{were caught in}} 4 {{seasonal}} bottom-trawl surveys carried out between July 1986 and May 1987 on the outer shelf and upper slope (124 to 587 m depth) along the southern Brazilian coast (30 ° 40 ' to 34 " 30 ' S). On the outer shelf (< 179 m), the demersalpelagic species Trichiurus lepturus, Trachurus lathami, Cynoscion guatucupa, Scomber japonicus, and Thyrsitops lepidopoides predominated and also {{to a lesser degree}} the demersal benthonic Umbrina canosai and Mullus argentinae. Antiyonia capros and Priacanthus arenatus were found associated with the relic coral hard bottoms of the shelf break (180 to 249 m). Further offshore, the demersal-pelagic species Ariomma bondi and Zenopsis conchifera and the demersal benthonic species Polyprion americanus and Helicolenus lahillei were abundant, both associated with rocky bottoms. The macrourids Coelorinchus marinii and Malacocephalus occidentalis characterized deep-water hauls p 450 m). Frequent and widespread, but less abundant in the catch, were Polymixia lowei, Urophycis mystacea and Merluccius hubbsi. Mean <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> (<b>kg</b> h-') decreased 6 -fold and the number of species by more than half along the depth range, with a sharp step at 350 m. Both catch and number of species were slightly higher in the winter cruises. Most species occurred in both winter and summer-autumn cruises, but, with increasing depth, the relative abundance of species that occur year-round decreased, whereas fishes that occur mostly in winter increased. The catch of demersal-pelagic fish decreased sharply below 350 m and differed little among seasons; catches of demersal-benthonic fish were more evenly distributed across the depth range and were larger in winter and spring. The high number of species on the shelf break may be attributable to the higher variety of soft and consolidated substrates and the overlapping of different water masses along the water column. The north-south shift of the western boundary of the Subtropical Convergence appears to be mainly responsible for the seasonal changes in abundance of the species...|$|E
40|$|Catch-effort {{data from}} main {{small-scale}} fisheries in Baia de Todos os Santos and Baixo Sul, in the State of Bahia, NE- Brazil, {{were collected by}} sampling the catches (kg) at random from April- 2005 to September - 2006. The uncertainty of the estimatives of the cpues was assessed by the resampling method. The results indicated that a different number of samples per month was for each fishing gear, when considering a stabilization of the relative maximum error around 25 %. For the gears responsible for more frequent catches, {{it is suggested that}} 120 to 140 samples/month are sufficient for this level of precision. Most of the fisheries presented positive asymmetrical total catch distributions per landing, while, the fishing effort (hours of fishing) data were close to a normal distribution in most fisheries. The monthly estimates basede in the samples of the daily catches (kg/day) presented, for most fisheries absence of marked seasonality patterns. Perhaps this is due to fact that in tropical multispecific multigear small-scale fisheries along the year one species compensates another in weigth, stabilizing the total catche figures. However, there were some cases indicating seasonality of the total catch. Confidence intervals at 95 % intervals for the cpue calculated by bootstrap, showed variations up to 90 % in the the total catch estimated by the bottom trawl and fish traps. Finally, the application of several ANCOVAs considering the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> (<b>kg)</b> as the response variate, the different unities of fishing effort for each gear as the covariate, and the factors (i) season of the year and (ii) the human fishing community, was carried out {{in order to understand the}} fishing proccess. The ANCOVAs for each fishing gear showed that, although minimum models have been reached with significant effect of the fishing effort and the season and/or human fishing community, most of the fisheries presented heterogeneity of slopes of the regression lines within the treatments, preventing the full application of the model.

Foram analisados: os tamanhos das amostras mensais; as distribuiÃÃes dos valores de captura agregada (todos os recursos em conjunto) e esforÃo por viagem; as capturas diÃrias como Ãndice de produtividade das frotas; a incerteza das estimativas de captura por unidade de esforÃo (cpue) por mÃtodo de re-amostragem; e a influÃncia das variÃveis (i) esforÃo de pesca, (ii) estaÃÃo dos ano e (iii) comunidade pesqueira na obtenÃÃo das capturas, atravÃs da aplicaÃÃo de modelos de anÃlise de covariÃncia (ANCOVA). Os resultados indicaram que um nÃmero de amostras mensais diferenciado foi requerido para cada arte de pesca, ao considerarmos uma estabilizaÃÃo do erro mÃximo relativo em torno de 25 %. Para as artes com os desembarques mais freqÃentes, entre 120 e 140 amostras sÃo suficientes por mÃs. A maioria das pescarias apresentaram distribuiÃÃes assimÃtricas positivas para os valores de captura por desembarque, enquanto que, para os valores de esforÃo em horas de pesca, distribuiÃÃes prÃximas de uma curva normal nÃo foram atÃpicas. As estimativas mensais de produtividade diÃria (kg/dia) das frotas apresentaram, na maior parte dos casos, uma ausÃncia de padrÃes marcados de sazonalidade. Nestas situaÃÃes, Ã provÃvel que a razoÃvel estabilidade temporal capturas (agregadas) tenha sido condicionada pela multi-especificidade caracterÃstica de desembarques de pescarias tropicais marinhas de pequena escala.

In most of the deep-sea fishes, the recruitment appeared to take place almost throughout the year and showed great similarity among the various species except Luciobrotula bartschi. Presently, all these resources remain unexploited, except the shrimps. The trawlers based at Cochin, Quilon and Munambam have been exploiting the deep-sea shrimp resources like the red-ring Arbreus alcocki from the Quilon Bank and other similar areas of< west coast for the last five years. Interestingly Psenopsis cyanea has been found to occur as bye-catch in these fishing operations. Therefore, these two species showed higher fishing mortality compared to practically nil value in other finfishes and shellfishes.

An array of 3 standard definition cameras and associated hardware were {{installed on the}} Nephrops trawler MFV Supreme, fishing a dual-purpose 22 fathom single-rig net with 70 mm cod end, co-owned by Leo McGirr and Simon Wills (skippered by Leo McGirr). The aim {{of the project was}} to evaluate how effective CCTV technology was in assessing the cod bycatch {{as a percentage of the}} <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> in this fishery. In particular, the intention was to find a way of enhancing the monitoring of a sector of the fleet potentially excluded from cod recovery measures by virtue of that sector accounting for < 1. 5 % of cod in the <b>total</b> <b>catch.</b> Results from the first series of trials (9 – 11 September) showed that, where crew catch-handling was modified, accurate assessments of cod live weights and hence percentage cod in the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> could be made by video analysis in a cost-effective manner. Conversely, the initial trials also highlighte...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 107 - 114. ix, 114 leaves, bound ill. 28 cmThe {{objectives}} of the study are to include endogenous supply and uncertainty in a fisheries market analysis and to provide an economic explanation for the allocation of <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> between two markets, a fresh fish market and a cannery market. In order to accomplish these objectives, an econometric model of the Hawaiian skipjack tuna market was constructed and evaluated. A five equation model was specified which determined the monthly number of fishing trips taken, the <b>total</b> <b>catch,</b> the quantity supplied to the fresh market, the fresh market price and the revenues received from the cannery. The effect of seasonal variation in availability of fish {{was included in the}} specification of the model. Uncertainty was included through a variable which reflected the probability of a successful trip. The estimation technique was three-stage-least squares (3 SLS). This method was selected because of the hypothesized simultaneous relationships and because of the known properties of the technique. Monthly time-series data for 1970 - 78 were used. The results of the estimation show that the probability of a non-zero catch trip and the expected revenues from cannery sales were positive determinants of the monthly number of trips taken. <b>Total</b> monthly <b>catch</b> is positively related to the number of trips and to the expected revenues from cannery sales and negatively related to the price of gasoline. The quantity supplied to the fresh fish market is negatively related to revenues from the cannery implying substitution between the two markets. Quantity sold to the fresh market is also positively determined by <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> in the off season with no empirical relationship observed in the on season between the quantity sold and <b>total</b> <b>catch.</b> The number of vessels fishing is a positive determinant of quantity supplied to the fresh market. The market price is negatively related to the quantity supplied and positively related to per capita income and average size of fish caught. The elasticity of demand for the fresh fish market is calculated to be - 1. 8. The revenues from the cannery are determined by the wholesale price of canned tuna, the fresh market price and the <b>total</b> <b>catch.</b> The conclusions of the study indicate that endogenous supply is an appropriate specification in this market; that the allocation of <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> between the markets is occurring by equalizing marginal revenues; and that uncertainty is a major determinant of the number of trips taken...|$|R
