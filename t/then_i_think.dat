25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong has {{discussed}} the group's status {{of being a}} punk band on a major record label, saying [...] "Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now; we've {{made a lot of}} money – we're not punk rock any more. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Laurie Brown of the CBC {{criticized the}} Walk of Fame, calling it [...] "just an {{attraction}} to lure tourists to theatres in the area." [...] She claimed {{that it would}} only honour Canadians with international impact, saying [...] "if it was truly for Canadians, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there would be more}} of a national bend to the whole thing. But I doubt I'm going to see a star on the Walk of Fame that is only a known-name here in Canada." ...|$|E

500|$|On 9 January 2015, Annie Mac played [...] "Living for Love" [...] on Radio 1 {{during her}} evening dance show. In a later {{interview}} with The Independent, Mac {{said that her}} mission was to [...] "represent the landscape of new music honestly", and hoped that older artists such as Madonna should not get excluded from the station. [...] "I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and I played her on my Friday show. [...] If I'm excited by a song, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's {{going to be all}} right to play it", Mac concluded.|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{told reporters}} {{that she did not}} think of her fall every day, but {{admitted}} to struggling with survivor's guilt. [...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe I should not have survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E
500|$|He has {{admitted}} that he is his [...] "mother's boy", which Ono has cited as the reason why she {{was never able to}} get close to him: [...] "Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind." [...] Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.|$|E

500|$|Little Mix {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of [...] "Wings" [...] with songwriter Iain James and production team TMS, although they invited input from other writers until they found the track complete. It {{was one of the}} first songs written for the group's debut studio album, DNA. Unlike most The X Factor (UK) alumni, the band were adamant on being involved with the writing of their first original single. Band member Perrie Edwards stressed, [...] "At the end of the day, it's our name on it. If we're not happy, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people will see straight through it." [...] Simon Cowell, owner of Little Mix's label Syco Music, also advised the group that the single would benefit from their own input.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{appreciate}} {{other kinds}} of drummers who play differently, but it's not my style or what works for this band. I get [...] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it, and I {{realize that this is}} what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{suggested}} that Pauline's presence in EastEnders was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike. In a report for BBC News, one viewer commented [...] "it's so sad, because I've watched her for 20 years. She's such a large character", and another said [...] "If she goes <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> EastEnders is finished." [...] BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard [...] "occupies a huge place in people's hearts", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, [...] "For many years Wendy simply was EastEnders for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the EastEnders spirit... We thank her for everything she has done for the show." ...|$|E

500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. He {{said that if he}} had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added [...] "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they have some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamb of God's Chris Adler said: [...] "If {{anybody who}} plays heavy metal {{says that they}} weren't {{influenced}} by Black Sabbath's music, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did." [...] Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: [...] "They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath {{are in the same}} league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary." [...] On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: [...] "The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come." [...] Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that [...] "Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{focuses on the}} yearning desire {{to be with a}} loved one for Christmas, {{regardless}} of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, bass effect, and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment. Slates Ragusea counts [...] "at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other places. (You might also analyze it as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate)." [...] According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains [...] "The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set." [...] In a piece on the song in Vogue, a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: [...] "those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's what gives it that timeless, classic quality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foreign {{minister}} said [...] "this is a disproportionate {{response to what}} has happened and if both sides are going to drive each other into a tight corner <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that all this will develop in a very dramatic and tragic way." [...] He added: [...] "We firmly reaffirm support for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{classical}} crossover success, Garðar has said, [...] "I don't {{want to go}} too {{far down}} the pop side because <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I would lose credibility in the classical world. If the album [...] does well, hopefully I could use that to my advantage, but I'm a classical opera singer – that's what I do, that's what I am." [...] His ambition is to sing Otello at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London.|$|E
2500|$|On the November 30, 2005, Hardball, Senator John Warner (R-Virginia) told Chris Matthews [...] "I {{saw that}} for the first time today. And as {{chairman}} of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, we'll look into that because I'm concerned that our credibility abroad is very important. And if we're manufacturing things or taking our wonderful troops and trying to translate their ideas into something that's more our idea, rather than the trooper's idea, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we should be looking at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because you are Kurt Dorn," [...] she said, thoughtfully. [...] "It's in the name, <b>then....</b> But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it {{a pretty}} name--a good name. Have I not consented {{to accept it}} as mine--for life?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Michael Neumann, a {{philosophy}} professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario {{expressed support for}} the boycott. Neumann stated that [...] "If people believe these are extreme circumstances and it will do some good, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's reasonable and perhaps justified." [...] He argued that a boycott is not anti-semitic, stating that [...] "It targets Israeli, not Jewish, professors." [...] He further stated that [...] "People may always have bad motives underlying good motives. And it's not absolutely impossible {{that some of these}} people have anti-Semitic feelings deep down, but do I think that plays a large part? No, I certainly do not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geneticist Bryan Sykes and {{his team}} at Oxford University report that DNA {{analysis}} of presumed Yeti (or [...] "Abominable Snowman") samples {{may have come from}} a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. According to Sykes, [...] "I think this bear, which nobody has seen alive, may still be there and may have quite a lot of polar bear in it. It may be some sort of hybrid and if its behaviour is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that may well be the source of the mystery and the source of the legend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reactions to {{the global}} {{surveillance}} disclosures {{among members of the}} U.S. Congress initially were largely negative. Speaker of the House John Boehner and senators Dianne Feinstein and Bill Nelson called Snowden a traitor, and several senators and representatives joined them in calling for Snowden's arrest and prosecution. Arizona Senator John McCain criticized politicians who voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act but were outraged by the NSA spying on phone calls by saying, [...] "We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation. Now, if members of Congress did not know what they were voting on, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that that's their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's." ...|$|E
