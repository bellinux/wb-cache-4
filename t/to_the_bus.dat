5|$|Doggett interrogates Dwight, and Scully interrogates Randall. Randall repeats Dwight's {{words as}} he reads his lips through a wall.

5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train. This was rejected because buses were not able to give the comfort and reliability of a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest opponents <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
50|$|It {{has lost}} most of its routes as all buses serving the area which no longer stop in <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> station, rather several new stops built along the road nearby. <b>The</b> only <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> station is London Buses route 150 and ELT route EL2, which terminates in <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> station. Because there is only an {{alighting}} point at <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> station only, passengers would have <b>to</b> board <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> on <b>the</b> main road nearby.|$|R

5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions.

It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus).</b> USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{congestion}} charge introduction in 2003, over £1.2 billion has been invested in transport through December 2013, including £960 million on improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on sustainable transport and the environment. There has been criticism because {{during the first}} ten years since the scheme was implemented, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues have been spent in operating the system and administrative expenses.|$|E

To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, a move that would later make them unusable for rail service.|$|E
5|$|The first bus {{terminus}} {{built in}} Lam Tin {{was then called}} Lam Tin Bus Terminus, which is today's Tak Tin Bus Terminus.

5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus,</b> a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E
5|$|English local {{authorities}} {{are required to}} produce Local Transport Plans (LTPs), strategies for developing local integrated transport {{as part of a}} longer-term vision. LTPs are used by central government to allocate funding for transport schemes. The final Local Transport Plan 2006–2011 for York was submitted to central government in March 2006. The plan addresses the fact that traffic in York is predicted to grow considerably over the coming years. The key aims of the plan are to ease congestion and improve accessibility, air quality and safety. Major funding allocations earmarked for {{the first five years of}} the plan's life span include outer ring road improvements, improved management of the highway network, improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> network including park and ride services, provision of off-road walking and cycling routes, air quality improvements and safety measures.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a transfer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some {{saying that the}} 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
