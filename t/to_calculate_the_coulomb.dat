In this thesis we study the use of molecular dynamics for atoms in a crystal. A model is introduced which describes interactions of a physical system with an external heat reservoir in molecular dynamics simulations. This is accomplished by the addition of a "virtual variable" to the Hamiltonian which is used to scale time. Aspects of this model are discussed and examples are presented for a simple system. Similarly, a constant pressure model is introduced in which additional virtual volume variables are added to the Hamiltonian. The volume and shape of the molecular dynamics cell are now free to vary.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{calculation}} of the interaction potentials of polyatomic systems by generalized Heitler-London (GHL) theory. In GHL theory the potential energies are expressed by Coulomb and exchange energies which are generalizations of the Coulomb and exchange integrals originally introduced by Heitler and London for the calculation of the potentials of the H_ 2 -molecule. In contrast to other methods, GHL theory makes use of non-symmetrized, so-called localized wave functions and Rayleigh Schroedinger perturbation theory. The latter provides the possibility of systematically improving the results by successively including higher orders. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the GHL theory is applied to polyatomic systems. The methods used <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coulomb</b> and exchange energies are described. Generally, there are two approaches to this problem: surface integral method for the exchange energies and polarization approximation for the Coulomb energy, perturbation series for all Coulomb and exchange energies. Both methods are explained. The leading non-additive contribution to the Coulomb energy at long range is the triple dipole dispersion energy. The Axilrod-Teller-Muto formula describes the long range behavior of this interaction but diverges at small internuclear distances. A damping function for this formula is developed for general three-body systems, explicitly taking into account the united atom limits. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Semi-analytical {{calculations}} for the two-body relaxation in softened potentials {{are presented}} and compared with N-body simulations. With {{respect to a}} Keplerian potential the increase of the relaxation time in the modified potentials is generally less than one order of magnitude, typically between 2 and 5, if the softening length is {{of the order of}} the mean interparticle distance. A comparison between two frequently applied softening schemes, one based on a Plummer mass distribution, the other defined by a spline interpolation on a compact support, shows that the spline-based procedure gives for the same central potential depth systematically smaller increases, but the differences between both are only of the order of 20 - 40 %. If the softening length of the spline based scheme is twice the Plummer softening length, the relaxation rates become almost identical. A simple model that assumes that the influence of softening can be described by neglecting all deflections, if the impact parameter is less than the softening length, and otherwise uses Keplerian orbits, is within a factor of 2 in agreement with the detailed calculations. Measuring the relaxation times by N-body simulations gives a fair agreement with the semianalytical results and, also with the simple model.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Physics, İzmir, 2014 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 37 - 40) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishvii, 44 leavesThis thesis comprises {{a theoretical}} {{study on the}} role of the inverse-Auger process in graphene nanostructures. Inverse-Auger effect (IAE) is the formation of a multitude of low energy excitons from a single exciton of higher energy. Its mechanism is the conversion of the kinetic energy of the high energy carriers to new excitons via Coulomb interaction. Bulk graphene has zero band gap energy and has two Dirac points which is linearly dependent crystal momentum. Due to quantum confinement, graphene nanoribbons and graphene flakes or the structures having periodically holes develop a band gap. The emergence of a band gap makes these structures eligible for solar cell applications. In bulk structures, due to translational symmetry momentum is conserved which leads to a decreased IAE. However, in nanostructures, in addition to the relaxation of momentum conservation condition, the Coulomb interaction between the carriers increases which leads to an enhanced IAE. In this thesis, a theoretical analysis of inverse-Auger effect is carried out for graphene and armchair graphene nanoribbons. Tight binding method is employed to obtain the electronic structure and <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coulomb</b> matrix elements for the inverse-Auger effect in this structures.

40|$|Purpose : The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{calculate}} the ^ 15 N(n, γ) ^ 16 N radiative capture cross section and its subsequent reaction rate by an indirect method and in that process investigate the effects of spectroscopic factors of different levels of ^ 16 N to the cross section. Method : A fully quantum mechanical Coulomb breakup theory under the aegis of post-form distorted wave Born approximation is used <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coulomb</b> breakup of ^ 16 N on Pb at 100 MeV/u. This is then related to the photodisintegration cross section of ^ 16 N(γ, n) ^ 15 N and subsequently invoking the principle of detailed balance, the ^ 15 N(n, γ) ^ 16 N capture cross section is calculated. Results : The non-resonant capture cross section is calculated with spectroscopic factors from the shell model and those extracted (including uncertainties) from two recent experiments. The data seems to favor a more single particle nature for the low-lying states of ^ 16 N. The total neutron capture rate is also calculated by summing up non-resonant and resonant (significant only at temperatures greater than 1 GK) contributions and comparison is made with other charged particle capture rates. In the typical temperature range of 0. 1 - 1. 2 GK, almost all the contribution to the reaction rate comes from capture cross sections below 0. 25 MeV. Conclusion : We have attempted to resolve the discrepancy in the spectroscopic factors of low-lying ^ 16 N levels and conclude that it would certainly be useful to perform a Coulomb dissociation experiment to find the low energy capture cross section for the reaction, especially below 0. 25 MeV.

This {{study has been}} done by assessing the statistical properties of the aftershock sequences associated with each of these earthquakes, namely b-value of Gutenberg–Richter relation, partitioning of radiated seismic energy, p -value of modified Omori law and the DC-value associated with the fractal dimension. The b-values of b = 0. 89 ± 0. 08 and b = 0. 88 ± 0. 08 were calculated for first main shock and second main shock sequence respectively. This suggests that this region is characterized by large differential stress; the genesis of large aftershock activity in a short time interval gives power this. Further, 2. 2 % of the whole energy is related with the aftershocks activity for first main shock sequence while 97. 8 % is associated with main shock; for second sequence, 20 % of the total energy is associated with the aftershocks activity while 80 % is associated with main shock. The p -values of 1. 1 ± 0. 12 and 1. 1 ± 0. 1 were calculated for first and second main shocks sequence respectively, which imply fast decay rate of aftershocks and high surface heat flux. A value of the spatial fractal dimension (Dc) equal to 2. 34 ± 0. 03 and 2. 54 ± 0. 02 for first and second main shocks sequence respectively, which reveals random spatial distribution and source in a two-dimensional plane that is being filled-up by fractures.
