5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen through <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E

25|$|Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique}} of Marx's theories was put under intense scrutiny by Marxian economists, such as Nikolai Bukharin. In his Economic Theory of the Leisure Class (1927), Bukharin argued that Böhm-Bawerk's axiomatic assumptions of individual freedom in his subjectivist theories are fallacious in that economic phenomena {{can only be}} understood under <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> a coherent, contextualised, and historical analysis of society, such as Marx's. By contrast, Austrian economists have regarded Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique of}} Marx as definitive. For example, Gottfried Haberler argued Böhm-Bawerk's thorough critique of Marx's economics was so devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally seen through <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> submission and control. This {{is apparent in}} the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E
25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{constitutional}} law scholar Erwin Chemerinsky {{participated in the}} same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and—from a First Amendment perspective—highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, {{that it could be}} seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that Morse v. Frederick is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.|$|E

[...] Walker highlighted the way that Lord had avoided telling the story through <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> social class, which had been the usual style of previous narratives, and instead successfully depicted the human element of the story by showing how those aboard reacted to the disaster whatever their class.|$|E
500|$|In October 1939 The Rules of the Game {{was officially}} banned in France for being [...] "depressing, morbid, immoral [...] having an {{undesirable}} {{influence over the}} young." [...] Other films that were similarly banned included Marcel Carné's Le Quai des brumes and Le Jour Se Lève. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated [...] "we are especially anxious to avoid representations of our country, our traditions, and our race that changes its character, lie about it, and deform it through <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> an artistic individual who is often original but not always sound." [...] The Marriage of Figaro, one of the inspirations for the film, had also been banned for similar reasons. After the end of World War II the 85-minute version of the film was re-released in Paris on September 26, 1945, and it was again banned.|$|E

Reviewing for The Christian Science Monitor, Randy Dotinga wrote that the book's close examination of [...] "dry and tedious" [...] political debates [...] "makes for rough sledding at times", and criticized Ellis' dismissal of academic historians.

50|$|To secure <b>the</b> <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens a {{compound}} of calcium carbonate, lead, and linseed oil, called litharge, was used.

If the litharge is white in color (lead carbonate) the material is mostly non-porous and may not easily be preserved, meaning that full litharge replacement might be necessary. If the litharge present is orange-red in color (lead-oxide), this substance tends to be more porous and may allow for stabilization.|$|R
40|$|Ensemble {{learning}} techniques generate multiple classifiers, {{so called}} base classifiers, whose combined classification results {{are used in}} order to increase the overall classification accuracy. In most ensemble classifiers the base classifiers are based on the Top Down Induction of Decision Trees (TDIDT) approach. However, an alternative approach for the induction of rule based classifiers is <b>the</b> <b>Prism</b> family <b>of</b> algorithms. <b>Prism</b> algorithms produce modular classification rules that do not necessarily fit into a decision tree structure. Prism classification rulesets achieve a comparable and sometimes higher classification accuracy compared with decision tree classifiers, if the data is noisy and large. Yet Prism still suffers from overfitting on noisy and large datasets. In practice ensemble techniques tend to reduce the overfitting, however there exists no ensemble learner for modular classification rule inducers such as <b>the</b> <b>Prism</b> family <b>of</b> algorithms.

McIver noted that Hetfield, the band's main lyricist, wrote about topics that he had not addressed before, such as his revolt against the establishment.
