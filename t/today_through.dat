5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other works {{that are still}} being performed or in print over a hundred and twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly <b>today</b> <b>through</b> his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ punning, as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme schemes, and served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E
5|$|One of {{its most}} {{successful}} periods followed during the Second World War when personnel of the Durham University Air Squadron were posted in the castle, doing short courses before joining the Royal Air Force. Those from the college who died during World War II were commemorated by the redevelopment of the Norman Gallery area of the Castle in the 1950s. This period also saw the launch of Castellum, an annual journal of the Castle Society, created to keep former students in touch with college life. In order to continue this expansion, the college purchased Lumley Castle in 1946 to house students, and by 1948 seventy five students were housed there. This section of the college developed a spirit of its own and is still remembered <b>today</b> <b>through</b> activities such as the Lumley Run.|$|E
5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Fairbanks also grew during this time. The Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra {{was founded in}} 1959, and the Fairbanks Drama Association was created in 1963. The Alaska Goldpanners {{baseball}} team was founded in 1959 as the city's first professional sports team. The next year, the Goldpanners hosted their first annual Midnight Sun Baseball Game, a tradition that had been conducted since 1905 and continues under the Goldpanners' auspices <b>today.</b> <b>Through</b> the 1960s, Fairbanks became much more like small towns in the Lower 48 as communications, transportation, and utilities improved.|$|E

It was early 1987 before this final stretch of SR372 was added to its designation and removed from a designation of SR5 Alternate.|$|E
25|$|The {{customary}} law of Normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives <b>today</b> <b>through</b> the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands.

25|$|Later, Marxist {{political}} thinker Louis Althusser was {{a student}} at ENS and taught there for many years, and many of his disciples later became known for their own thought: among them were Étienne Balibar, philosopher Alain Badiou, who still teaches at the school as an emeritus professor, and Jacques Rancière. Still later, in the 1940s and 1950s, the world-renowned thinker Michel Foucault, founder of the history of systems of thought and future professor at the Collège de France {{was a student}} a few years ahead of the founder of deconstruction, Jacques Derrida and the thinker of individuation Gilbert Simondon. The tradition continues <b>today</b> <b>through</b> such philosophers as Jacques Bouveresse, Jean-Luc Marion, Claudine Tiercelin and Quentin Meillassoux, and the school has also produced prominent public intellectuals like Stéphane Hessel and such New Philosophers as Bernard-Henri Lévy and Benny Lévy.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, the Santa Ana River Mainstem Project, which {{involved}} concreting the lower [...] of the river, was first proposed. Construction work began in 1989, and <b>today,</b> <b>through</b> much of Orange County, the river's channel {{is essentially an}} enormous box culvert. The second dam, Seven Oaks Dam, was completed in 1999. This dam captures flood runoff from Santa Ana Canyon before it can enter the Inland Empire. The dam was designed to withstand a 350-year flood. Today, the river lies mainly between levees and concrete channels, and especially in its lower course, functions only as a flood drainage channel.|$|E
500|$|U.S. Highway 67 was {{extended}} into Iowa in late 1934, when it replaced the southernmost portion of US55. [...] It crossed the Mississippi River over the Government Bridge with US32 (now US6). [...] The highway followed {{roughly the same}} route it does <b>today</b> <b>through</b> the then-Tri Cities, along the river to Clinton to its present end near Sabula. [...] Instead of ending at US52, the two routes continued north together along the river through Bellevue. [...] Near Dubuque, the two highways converged with two others: US61 and US151. [...] Closer to downtown Dubuque, US67 ended where US61 and US151 diverged from US52.|$|E

[...] Also in 1965, [...] General Mills purchased Rainbow Crafts and all rights to Play-Doh for $3 million, placing the compound with its Kenner Products subsidiary. [...] In 1971, Rainbow Crafts and Kenner Products merged, and, in 1987, the Tonka Corporation bought the two. In 1991, Hasbro became Play-Doh's owner, and continues to manufacture the product <b>today</b> <b>through</b> its preschool division.

500|$|Ammar is a {{professional}} puppeteer, puppet builder, creative content developer and voice actor from Saudi Arabia. He is the creative content manager and the master puppeteer at Bidaya Media Company, the producers of Iftah Ya Simsim, and is the muppet performer of Ka’aki (Cookie Monster) and Gargour (Grover). He also voices a variety of muppet characters that includes Badr (Bert), Addad (Count Von Count) and {{one half of the}} Two Headed Monster. Ammar is the founder of 31 Workshop, and is also a designer, creative consultant and lecturer. Previously, Ammar specialized in design solutions both locally and internationally since 2001 across urban, architecture and graphic design.

He was also mentored by Muppet performer Marty Robinson and trained under several professional muppet performers like Matt Vogel, Peter Linz and Michael Earl.|$|E
500|$|In all, Sullivan's artistic output {{included}} 23 operas, 13 major orchestral works, eight choral {{works and}} oratorios, two ballets, one song cycle, incidental music to several plays, numerous hymns and other church pieces, {{and a large}} body of songs, parlour ballads, part songs, carols, and piano and chamber pieces. Sullivan's operas have often been adapted, first in the 19th century as dance pieces and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves. Since then, his music has been made into ballets (Pineapple Poll (1951) and Pirates of Penzance - The Ballet! (1991)) and musicals (The Swing Mikado (1938), The Hot Mikado (1939) and Hot Mikado (1986), Hollywood Pinafore (1945), The Black Mikado (1975), etc.). His operas are not only frequently performed, but also frequently parodied, pastiched, quoted and imitated in comedy routines, advertising, law, film, television, and other popular media. His legacy, apart from writing the Savoy operas and his other works, is felt perhaps most strongly <b>today</b> <b>through</b> his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Gilbert developed directly influenced the development of the modern musical throughout the 20th century. [...] In addition, biographies and scholarly articles and analyses continue to be written about Sullivan's life and work.|$|E
