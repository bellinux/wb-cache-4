5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{current state of the}} Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household {{and a member of the}} Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was used successfully {{for more than a}} decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E
5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored {{off the coast of}} New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

25|$|In 1729, {{he became}} Vice Admiral of Scotland, but lost the {{position}} on 5 May 1733, {{mainly because of}} {{his opposition to the}} Excise Bill of 1733 promoted by Prime Minister Robert Walpole.

50|$|Despite its {{downtown}} location, the Lamp House has {{a secluded}} feel {{because of its}} mid-block site. In addition <b>to</b> <b>laying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> driveway and steps {{leading up to the}} eastern side of the house as well as the veranda on its north side, Wright hardscaped the lot with urns (now missing), curbs, and concrete-capped rubblestone retaining walls to develop an extensive yard and garden, sculpting what had originally been a steeply sloped lot into a cascading, multi-tiered landscape. The basement receives sufficient sunlight from a window on the eastern facade to overwinter tender garden plants in containers.|$|R
25|$|The colonists {{first used}} this trail {{to deliver the}} mail using post riders. The first ride <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Upper Post Road started on January 1, 1673.

25|$|It was {{originally}} built {{and laid out}} as a rural cemetery, with a parklike setting {{on the banks of}} Oatka Creek. In the early 20th century its design philosophy changed, when a large mausoleum to local businessman Orator Francis Woodward, who in his last years made a fortune developing Jell-O into a bestselling dessert, was built in the southern section of the cemetery near his factory. The architect hired by the family <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> section was influenced by the City Beautiful movement, giving that area a more orderly cast.|$|E

The ratio of distance from union link end to pivot with radius rod to {{the distance between the}} valve rod end to the pivot with the radius rod should be in the same proportion as half piston travel to valve lap plus lead.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} chords {{is called a}} chord progression. Although any chord may in {{principle}} be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing key in common-practice harmony. To describe this, chords are numbered, using Roman numerals (upward from the key-note), per its diatonic function. Common ways of notating or representing chords in western music other than conventional staff notation include Roman numerals, figured bass (much used in the Baroque era), macro symbols (sometimes used in modern musicology), and various systems of chord charts typically found in the lead sheets used in popular music <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.|$|E
25|$|Transportation {{was used}} {{early on to}} support {{industry}} and commerce in New York State. The Boston Post Road, between what then the relatively small City of New York and Boston, began as a path to deliver the post using post riders (the first ride <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Upper Post Road starting January 22, 1673), and developed into a wagon, or stage road in later colonial times. During the 19th century, pieces of the road were taken over and improved by turnpike companies. In the 1910s and 1920s, the Lower Post Road alignment (and realignments made to the route) was a National Auto Trail known as the Boston Post Road. Large sections of the various routes are still given the name Boston Post Road, {{much of it is}} now U.S. Route 1.|$|E
25|$|The Dixie Highway, {{an idea of}} Carl G. Fisher of the Lincoln Highway Association, was {{organized}} in early December 1914 in Chattanooga. On April 3, 1915, governors of the interested states met at Chattanooga, and each selected two commissioners <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> route from Chicago to Miami. On May 22, 1915, the commission decided on a split route in order to serve more communities. The route left Chicago to the south via Danville, Illinois and turned east to Indianapolis, where it split. The west branch headed south through Tennessee via Louisville and Nashville to Chattanooga, Tennessee, while the east route went east from Indianapolis to Dayton, Ohio before turning south via Cincinnati; Lexington, Kentucky; and Knoxville, Tennessee; to Chattanooga. Two alternate routes were included between Chattanooga and Atlanta, and again between Atlanta and Macon, Georgia. Finally, between Macon and Jacksonville, Florida, the west route went south to Tallahassee, Florida before turning east, while the east route {{had yet to be}} defined in detail. From Jacksonville, the route followed the east coast south to Miami along the John Anderson Highway. The commission voted to invite Michigan and to extend a branch of the east route from Dayton north to Detroit via Toledo, as well as to study a loop around Lake Michigan and a western route between Tallahassee and Miami.|$|E
