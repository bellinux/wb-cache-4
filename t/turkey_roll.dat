Principal factors affecting gel forming properties, freeze-thaw stability and sensory quality of ocean pout surimi were examined alone, as well as, in combination with either red hake or turkey meat under various conditions. Parameters studied were: i) moisture and salt levels, ii) thermal gelation in a single {{as well as a}} two-stage heating process, iii) optimization of gel formimg properties and freeze-thaw stability of blended surimi, iv) texture-modifying effect of different nonfish proteins in the ocean pout surimi and its applicability as a binder in formed products, and v) use of ocean pout in the turkey as an extender. Compressive force (cohesiveness) and penetration force (rigidity) were measured for the evaluation of gel forming properties of surimi, and expressible moisture for water binding ability as well as freeze-thaw stability of surimi gel. Sensory quality of ocean pout incorporated <b>turkey</b> <b>roll</b> was also evaluated. The 74 % moisture level produced the most cohesive gel while NaCl progressively increased cohesiveness and rigidity, accompanied by a general decrease in expressible moisture. Thermal gelation was best demonstrated on a single-stage heating at 90 C by maintaining the integrity of the gel; regardless of the length of time of heating as compared to a two-stage heating, heat~setting at different temperatures and subsequent cooking at 90 C. Blending ocean pout surimi with red hake surimi resulted in increases in all measured physical characteristics as the red hake surimi level increased.

40|$|A pink color defect is {{commonly}} observed in freshly cut surfaces of cooked <b>turkey</b> <b>rolls</b> and fades rapidly upon exposure to air. The non uniform pink color makes the product appear undercooked, {{and the product}} must be discounted. The oxidation-reduction potential of the meat is important in development of pink defect. A pink color {{similar to that of}} commercial product was observed when the cooked meat was treated with either sodium nitrite or sodium dithionite. The pink color in nitrite treated meat was due to nitroso pigment formation, but in samples treated with dithionite the pink color was due to formation of a hemochrome complex. Pink color was also observed in <b>turkey</b> <b>rolls</b> formulated with nicotinic acid, nicotinamide or sodium nitrite. Reflectance and absorbance spectrophotometric studies on commercial or laboratory prepared samples having pink defect showed that the responsible pigment was a reduced hemochrome rather than a nitroso pigment. The hemochrome is probably a nicotinamide-denatured globin complex with ferrous iron of the heme molecule.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of milk solids on restructured and emulsified <b>turkey</b> <b>rolls.</b> the milk solids used were nonfat dry milk (NFDM), whey protein concentrate (WPC), and calcium caseinate (CC). <b>Turkey</b> <b>rolls</b> consisted of 100 % breast meat or 90 : 10 or 70 : 30 breast-to-thigh, salt (1 %), water (10 %), internal or cluster fat (10 %), and 3 % of various milk solids (WPC, NFDM, CC). The objectives of these studies were to 1) determine which ratio between light and dark meat is preferred; 2) determine which of milk solids evaluated will permit {{the highest level of}} dark meat incorporation into evaluated products; 3) determine if there is a mechanism by which milk proteins lighten poultry meat; and 4) determine which milk protein produces the best bind between meat pieces. Panelists were used in the first study to evaluate cooked meat attributes of color intensity, color uniformity, cohesiveness, tenderness, roasted turkey flavor, juiciness, and overall acceptability. The attributes were rated on a seven-point scale. Rolls made with WPC or NFDM scored significantly higher for color uniformity, cohesiveness, roasted turkey flavor, and overall acceptability than rolls made with CC. No differences were noted among treatments for juiciness or toughness with rolls of the same light-to-dark meat ratio. However, the 90 : 10 rolls were rated significantly more tender than the rolls made with the 70 : 30 ratio. Rolls containing milk solids had significantly higher yields than the controls. In the second study, rolls were made using the preferred meat ratio (90 : 10 breast:thigh meat).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} effect of irradiation and antimicrobials on the quality and survival of L. monocytogenes, a significant safety concern, in RTE turkey meat products. Results showed that dietary vitamin E was effective in {{reducing the number of}} L. monocytogenes carried by live turkeys, a source of L. monocytogenes contamination in RTE products. Irradiation was very effective in eliminating L. monocytogenes in both <b>turkey</b> breast <b>rolls</b> and hams. However, irradiation also caused quality changes. A dose of 2. 0 kGy irradiation produced significant off-odor, mainly sulfur-related odor/flavor, in vacuum-packaged RTE <b>turkey</b> ham and <b>rolls.</b> Thus, only low dose irradiation is recommended. However, low-dose irradiation allowed some L. monocytogenes to survive during irradiation. Antimicrobial agents were formulated into RTE <b>turkey</b> <b>rolls</b> and hams as an additional hurdle to suppress the growth of L. monocytogenes that survived low-dose irradiation. Antimicrobials, including 0. 1 % potassium benzoate (PB), 2 % sodium lactate (SL), and 0. 1 % sodium diacetate (SDA) were used singly or in combinations to assess their effectiveness in inhibiting the growth of L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products following low-dose irradiation. Results showed that for RTE turkey meats formulated with 0. 1 % PB + 2 % SL or 2 % SL + 0. 1 % SDA, 1. 0 kGy irradiation was effective in suppressing the growth of L. monocytogenes for about six weeks at 4 °C, and 2. 0 kGy irradiation was listeriostatic during a 42 -day refrigerated storage period. For RTE turkey meat formulated with three antimicrobials in combination, 0. 1 % PB + 2 % SL + 0. 1 % SDA, 1. 0 kGy irradiation was listeriostatic.

The number of cells viable after cookery of the ham or turkey was influenced by the position of the slice of meat in the roast {{as well as by the}} final temperature to which the product was heated. Plate counts for turkey or beef casserole held at temperatures in the range of 5 to 10 C for 48 hr indicated stabilization of the population or a tendency to decrease. At 24 C, the multiplication of cells was apparent in 4 hr and rapid in 6 hr. When the food was maintained at 68 C, populations remained viable for 6 hr and the counts did not change markedly. In turkey maintained at 37 C, the number of cells increased sharply within 4 hr...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) {{and total}} nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels were monitored during meat cookery {{with a standard}} Ovenpak and a new ultralow-NOx (ULN) cyclonic gas burner. With the standard burner, CO varied from 103 to 152 ppm, NOx was 1. 3 − 10. 7 ppm, and surface pinking was observed on both beef and turkey. The ULN burner at optimal efficiency produced only 6. 7 ppm of CO and 1 ppm of NOx, insufficient to cause surface pinking. To determine the relative contribution of CO and NOx to pinking, trials were also conducted in an electric oven with various pure gases. Pinking was not observed with up to 149 ppm of CO or 5 ppm of NO. However, as little as 0. 4 ppm of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) caused pinking of <b>turkey</b> <b>rolls.</b> Beef roasts were pink at 3 ̆e 2. 5 ppm of NO 2. Thus, pinking previously attributed to CO and NO in gas ovens is instead due to NO 2, which has much greater reactivity than NO with moisture at meat surfaces...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Turkey breast muscle was {{injected}} {{with salt and}} various types of phosphate (sodium tripolyphosphate; 90 % sodium tripolyphosphate and 10 % sodium hexametaphosphate; 75 % sodium tripolyphosphate and 25 % sodium hexametaphosphate; 90 % sodium tripolyphosphate and 10 % tetrasodium pyrophosphate) solutions to 3 % of green weight. After injection, breasts were tumbled in a cold room in a laboratory-sized tumbler for 2 hr at 20 rpm with alternate intervals of tumbling for 10 min and 10 min of rest {{for a total of}} 1 hr of tumbling. The presence of salt, during tumbling, significantly reduced expressible moisture and cooking losses but did not significantly affect shear values. All of the phosphates used significantly reduced expressible moisture and cooking losses without influencing shear values. Sensory properties (binding ability, juiciness, and flavor) of rolls made from tumbled meat were significantly improved when the breast muscle was tumbled in the presence of salt and phosphates. A combination of sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate significantly improved extractability of myofibrillar proteins during the tumbling process as compared to other phosphate sources. These results generally indicated that the presence of both salt and polyphosphates during tumbling improve sensory properties of <b>turkey</b> <b>rolls.</b> (Key words: tumbling, turkey muscle, salt, phosphates...|$|R
40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} {{is a safe}} and effective technology {{that can be used}} to inactivate foodborne pathogens associated with poultry such as S. typhimurium, C. jejuni, and L. monocytogenes and minimize the occurrence of foodborne illness in at-risk populations without increasing the temperature of the irradiated medium. The effect of hurdle technology (ionizing radiation with plant/fruit extracts) on poultry and eggs has been repeatedly studied with promising results. Although irradiation increased lipid oxidation, infusion of chicken meat with plant extracts could substantially reduce the lipid oxidation caused by irradiation. Addition of more than 2 % plum extract to <b>turkey</b> breast <b>rolls</b> was effective in controlling lipid oxidation of irradiated meat and the production of aldehydes (hexanal, heptanal, octanal, and nonanal). This chapter provides a detailed review of the available data regarding the irradiation effects on poultry, eggs, and egg products. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The Thanksgiving {{section is}} the newest section of the park, added in 2006 to commemorate Holiday World's 60th anniversary. The anchor {{attraction}} of this section is The Voyage which wraps around parts of the midway; guests walk under The Voyage 's brake run upon entering the section through Fourth of July. In {{the back of the}} Thanksgiving section is Thunderbird, the wing coaster, and a secondary entrance to Splashin' Safari. In addition to The Voyage and Thunderbird, the Thanksgiving section includes the second of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Plymouth Rock Café, which serves typical Thanksgiving food such as turkey, prime rib, stuffing, green beans, and bread <b>rolls.</b> <b>Turkeys</b> can often be heard [...] "gobbling" [...] throughout the section as sounds emanate from the Gobbler Getaway ride and Pilgrims' Challenge game.|$|R
6000|$|We {{know not}} what tears were shed {{in the vast}} and silent halls of Chanticlere, when the company were gone, and the four cooks, and four maids, six footmen, and {{temporary}} butler had driven back in their private trap to the metropolis, which is not forty miles distant from that splendid castle. How can we tell? The guests departed, the lodge-gates shut; all is mystery:--darkness with one pair of wax candles blinking dismally in a solitary chamber; all the rest dreary vistas of brown hollands, <b>rolled</b> <b>Turkey</b> carpets, gaunt ancestors on the walls scowling out of the twilight blank. The imagination is at liberty to depict his lordship, with one candle, over his dreadful endless tapes and papers; her ladyship with the other, and an old, old novel, wherein perhaps, Mrs. Radcliffe describes a castle as dreary as her own; and poor little Clara sighing and crying {{in the midst of}} these funereal splendours, as lonely and heart-sick as Oriana in her moated grange:--poor little Clara! ...|$|R
60|$|On {{entering}} the dining-room, by {{the orders of}} the individual in gaiters, Rebecca found that apartment not more cheerful than such rooms usually are, when genteel families are out of town. The faithful chambers seem, as it were, to mourn the absence of their masters. The <b>turkey</b> carpet has <b>rolled</b> itself up, and retired sulkily under the sideboard: the pictures have hidden their faces behind old sheets of brown paper: the ceiling lamp is muffled up in a dismal sack of brown holland: the window-curtains have disappeared under all sorts of shabby envelopes: the marble bust of Sir Walpole Crawley is looking from its black corner at the bare boards and the oiled fire-irons, and the empty card-racks over the mantelpiece: the cellaret has lurked away behind the carpet: the chairs are turned up heads and tails along the walls: and in the dark corner opposite the statue, is an old-fashioned crabbed knife-box, locked and sitting on a dumb waiter.|$|R
