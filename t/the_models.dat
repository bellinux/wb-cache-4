5|$|<b>The</b> <b>models</b> {{and other}} {{elements}} of Crystal Palace Park were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973. <b>The</b> <b>models</b> were extensively restored in 2002, and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the Great Exhibition in October 1851, Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace was bought and moved to Penge Place atop Sydenham Hill, South London by the newly formed Crystal Palace Company. The grounds that {{surrounded}} it were then extensively renovated and turned into a public park with ornamental gardens, replicas of statues and two new man-made lakes. As part of this renovation, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to build the first-ever life-sized models of extinct animals. He had originally planned to just re-create extinct mammals before deciding on building dinosaurs as well, which he did with advice from Sir Richard Owen, a celebrated biologist and palaeontologist of the time. Hawkins set up a workshop on site at the park and built <b>the</b> <b>models</b> there. <b>The</b> <b>models</b> were displayed on three islands acting as a rough timeline, the first island for the Paleozoic era, a second for the Mesozoic, and a third for the Cenozoic. <b>The</b> <b>models</b> were given more realism by making the water level in the lake rise and fall, revealing different amounts of the dinosaurs. To mark the launch of <b>the</b> <b>models,</b> Hawkins held a dinner on New Year's Eve 1853 inside the mould of one of the Iguanodon models.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, the Raise the Arrow project {{confirmed}} {{the discovery of}} one of <b>the</b> <b>models</b> {{at the bottom of}} Lake Ontario. Photos of the aircraft on the lake-bed have been published on the group's website.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 40XR, {{introduced}} in 2004, is a higher-performance variant of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 40, with <b>the</b> same modifications as used to convert <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 45 into <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 45XR.|$|R
5000|$|In early January 1992, HP {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 705, code-named [...] "Bushmaster Snake", and <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 710, code-named [...] "Bushmaster Junior". Both {{systems are}} low-end diskless workstations, with <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 705 using a 32 MHz PA-7000 and <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 710 using a 50 MHz version. At introduction, <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 705 was priced at under US$5,000, and <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 710 under US$10,000.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1803 {{was later}} {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1814 Common Rifle, <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1817 Common Rifle and <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1819, {{when it was}} decided that a more rugged weapon was needed.|$|R
5|$|In Wasmannian mimicry, {{the mimic}} resembles {{a model that}} it lives along with in a nest or colony. Most of <b>the</b> <b>models</b> here are social insects such as ants, termites, bees and wasps.|$|E
5|$|Putnam's {{models were}} {{approved}} by the commission on June 2, 1936. The Medallic Art Company of New York reduced <b>the</b> <b>models</b> to half-dollar sized hubs from which coinage dies could be prepared.|$|E
5|$|The PSA Group, {{formed in}} 1976 when Peugeot bought out its competitor, Citroën, {{took over the}} former Chrysler Europe in 1979; one of its first {{decisions}} was to rebrand all of <b>the</b> <b>models</b> manufactured in the French and British factories to Talbot. Among <b>the</b> <b>models</b> inherited from Chrysler was the Scottish-built rear-wheel drive Talbot Sunbeam, the only small car in the lineup.|$|E
30|$|Refine <b>the</b> <b>model.</b> <b>The</b> <b>model</b> is {{adjusted}} as any nonsignificant factor can {{be removed}} from <b>the</b> <b>model.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The War of 1812 had {{revealed}} many weaknesses in American muskets. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1812 Musket {{was created in}} an attempt to improve both the design and manufacture of <b>the</b> musket. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1816 made further improvements, and replaced <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1812. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1812 had borrowed heavily from the design of <b>the</b> French Charleville <b>model</b> 1777 musket, and this design was retained for <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1816. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1816 had a 42 inch long [...]69 caliber smoothbore barrel, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1812, but had a longer lock plate, a shorter trigger guard, and a longer bayonet than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1812. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1816 also had a more straight lined stock. The overall length of the weapon was 58 inches.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 19 was {{produced}} from 1957 (first model number stampings) to November 1999. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 66 {{was produced}} from 1970 until 2005. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 66 differed by {{its use of}} stainless steel and its smooth target-type trigger. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 19 and <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 66 had <b>the</b> same trigger options.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>models</b> {{represent}} fifteen genera of extinct animals, not all dinosaurs. They {{are from}} a wide range of geological ages, and include true dinosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs mainly from the Mesozoic era, and some mammals from the more recent Cenozoic era.|$|E
5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} <b>the</b> <b>models</b> declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of <b>the</b> <b>models.</b> <b>The</b> <b>models</b> and the park fell into disrepair {{as the years went}} by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and <b>the</b> <b>models</b> became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|All the {{characters}} featured in Alan Wake {{were based on}} real life models. Ilkka Villi and Jonna Järvenpää, <b>the</b> <b>models</b> for Alan and Alice Wake, respectively, are the only Finnish models in the game; all other models were American. Voice overs were provided by native actors from Japan and America for their respective regions.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, {{the company}} {{produced}} <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> PA, which was {{often used as}} a taxi. Other <b>models</b> included <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> OE, which resembled a Sunbeam-Talbot, <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> VK-2, and <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> PK-1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video display}} in <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II {{is similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I. A 12" [...] RCA B&W {{television}} CRT is used. However, <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II's video circuitry was significantly improved {{in the interest of}} better picture quality, as one of the criticisms of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I was that the included monitor was merely an RCA television set with the RF, IF, and sound stripped out. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> II, in contrast, used a dedicated monochrome composite monitor with higher-quality and better-adjusted components than the modified TV set provided with <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I. <b>The</b> text display on <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II was 80x24 rather than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I/III's 64x16 text and also added lowercase letters, one major feature that <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I was lacking. In addition, it could be operated in 40x24 text mode. The character set in <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> II was somewhat different from <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> I/III. It de-emphasized graphics characters and replaced them with additional currency and mathematical symbols.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1770 had a {{modified}} lock plate, stronger barrel bands, and {{a modified}} ramrod retaining spring. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1771 moved <b>the</b> bayonet lug and strengthened <b>the</b> barrel. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1770 and 1771 are often grouped {{together as a}} single <b>model.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1773 was similar to previous models, but again modified the ramrod retaining spring. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1773 is often {{considered to be a}} minor variant to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1770/1771. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1774 had a shorter trigger guard, and the tail of the frizzen was cut square. The ramrod design was also modified in <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1774, giving it more of a pear shaped head. Similarly minor changes were made for <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1776, which is often not considered to be a separate model.|$|R
5|$|Because of northeasterly shear, {{the center}} of the {{circulation}} was removed from the convection, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low late on August 29. Many of <b>the</b> <b>models</b> had indicated that this was likely, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) instead chose to forecast slight strengthening.|$|E
5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with <b>the</b> <b>models</b> and their surroundings. September Morn is typical of his style.|$|E
5|$|Close to Lakefield and off {{the road}} in their own {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become <b>the</b> <b>models</b> for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with a lump of sugar balanced on her nose.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1822 was an {{improvement}} to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1816 Musket. Some documents refer to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1822 {{as its own}} separate model, but other documents {{refer to it as}} a variant of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1816.|$|R
30|$|Through {{the case}} studies we {{demonstrate}} some steps of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> development methodology, giving special attention to <b>the</b> <b>model</b> tradeoff and conformance test. In Section 3.1 we present some results of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> verification and in the Section 3.2 we present how <b>the</b> <b>model</b> tradeoff was done and also some results of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> validation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 42 {{came out}} in 1952 as the Airweight Centennial but was changed in 1957 to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 42. <b>The</b> gun was the same design as <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 40 except <b>the</b> frame was made of an {{aluminum}} alloy, resulting in a lower weight than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 40. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 42 was discontinued in 1974.|$|R
5|$|Down {{the street}} from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as <b>the</b> <b>models</b> for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24years out of shame. He was hidden until {{virtually}} forgotten; he died in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{uncertainties}} {{about how}} the region's subtropical ridge would interact with Irene, <b>the</b> <b>models</b> continued to give unclear signals of the storm's future. Some of <b>the</b> <b>models</b> predicted that Irene would make landfall in North Carolina, while others continued to anticipate that Irene would dissipate. The uncertainty ended when a weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed Irene to turn sharply northward, which caused the storm to pass midway between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda on August 15. Soon after, upper-level shear weakened greatly, and Irene rapidly intensified, first to a hurricane, then to its peak strength as a 105mph (170km/h) Category 2 hurricane {{on the afternoon of}} August 16, while located 350miles (560km) northeast of Bermuda; {{at the same time it}} also attained minimum pressure of 970mbar. Though NHC meteorologists thought it was likely that Irene would become a hurricane, they were not expecting an intensification of such a magnitude.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to tidal heating, {{the interior of}} Europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle. But <b>the</b> <b>models</b> and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone, thus implying that tidal heating has {{a leading role in}} Europa.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 70, {{introduced}} in 2013, is a shortened variant of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 75 - alternatively {{described as an}} upgraded <b>Model</b> 40XR, with <b>the</b> same modifications as used to convert <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 45XR into <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 75. It was far less popular than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 75, and was dropped from the Learjet line in 2015.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 85 {{line has}} been {{enlarged}} to include <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 856. This model is similar to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 85, but adds an additional round in the cylinder to bring <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 856's capacity to 6 rounds.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 {{was a minor}} {{improvement}} over <b>the</b> Springfield <b>Model</b> 1835 musket, and therefore was not dramatically different from <b>the</b> older <b>Model</b> 1835. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 featured a longer bayonet with a clasp and a stock with a comb. The designers of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 anticipated that the musket would eventually be rifled, and made the barrel heavier than <b>the</b> earlier <b>Model</b> 1835 accordingly. <b>The</b> various modifications to <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1840 made it slightly heavier than <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1835.|$|R
5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows <b>the</b> <b>models</b> to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E
5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of <b>the</b> <b>models</b> were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Matchbox toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with 3D modelling. He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained by rotating <b>the</b> <b>models</b> along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and blue, as well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the rendering process was a waste of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from <b>the</b> <b>models</b> over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1869 Cadet Rifle was a {{shortened}} {{version of}} <b>the</b> Springfield <b>Model</b> 1868. It had a 29.5 inch barrel, {{compared to the}} 32.5 inch barrel of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1868, and had an overall length of 48.8 inches. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1869 was produced using Model 1868 receivers and breech blocks, but used a stock that was manufactured specifically for <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1869. <b>The</b> <b>Model</b> 1869 had a narrower buttplate and the stock around the barrel was thinner than on <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1868.|$|R
30|$|In Eq. (8), the {{residual}} errors ɛ(t) were unknown in <b>the</b> <b>model</b> ARMA (6, 4), so the time series fitting residual errors δ (t)^' were not calculated by the linear derivation. However, if <b>the</b> <b>model</b> order w was large enough, <b>the</b> <b>model</b> AR(w) could approximately substitute <b>the</b> <b>model</b> ARMA(p, q). And {{the residual}} errors ɛ(t)′ of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> AR(w) could also replace the unknown residual errors ɛ(t) in <b>the</b> <b>model</b> ARMA (6, 4).|$|R
50|$|In 1877, {{many changes}} were made to both <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1873 rifle and <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1873 carbine (<b>the</b> carbine was just a shorter version of the rifle). Historically, <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1877 rifle has just been {{considered}} to be a variant of <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1873, while <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 1877 carbine has been {{considered to be a}} separate model.|$|R
