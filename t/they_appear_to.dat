5|$|Bill and Melinda Gates {{have said}} that they intend to leave their three {{children}} $10million each as their inheritance. With only $30million kept in the family, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.|$|E

5|$|Many {{positions}} are winnable although {{at first sight}} <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be non-winnable. For example, the position in the middle diagram is a win for Black in 154 moves (the white pawn is captured at around 80 moves).|$|E
5|$|Nematodes of {{the genus}} Schistonchus {{are found in the}} syconia (and the {{pollinator}} wasps) of many species of fig, with F. rubiginosa hosting two species. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be less species-specific than wasps. S. altermacrophylla is generally associated with F. rubiginosa though it has been recorded on several other fig species.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj has various {{so-called}} Potbelly monuments representing obese {{human figures}} sculpted from large boulders, {{of a type}} found throughout the Pacific lowlands, extending from Izapa in Mexico to El Salvador. Their precise function is unknown but <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> date from the Late Preclassic.|$|E

5|$|The Guilden Morden boar {{recalls the}} Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, where helmets with boar imagery are {{referenced}} five times. In three cases <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> feature freestanding boars atop the helmets, like the Guilden Morden example. Such {{is the case}} when Grendel's mother seeks vengeance {{for the death of}} her son.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, {{although they were}} not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E

5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Hymenoptera in {{the form}} of Symphyta (Xyelidae) first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Lower Triassic. Apocrita, wasps in the broad sense, appeared in the Jurassic, and had diversified into many of the extant superfamilies by the Cretaceous; <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have evolved from the Symphyta. Fig wasps with modern anatomical features first appeared in the Lower Cretaceous of the Crato Formation in Brazil, some 65 million years before the first fig trees.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles {{as part of the}} range of attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, stargazey pie {{and other}} variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, {{covered with a}} pastry crust. Although {{there are a few}} {{variations}} with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy pie is fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be gazing skyward. This allows the oils released during cooking to flow back into the pie.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{men of the}} Minch, {{also known}} as storm kelpies or in Scottish Gaelic as na fir ghorma, fear gorm or sruth nam fear gorm, are mythological creatures inhabiting the stretch of water between the {{northern}} Outer Hebrides and mainland Scotland, looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be localised to the Minch and surrounding areas, unknown {{in other parts of}} Scotland and without counterparts {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> hold on to their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E
5|$|The old Principate auxilia regiments {{provided}} {{the basis for}} units at all three grades. The Notitia Dignitatum lists about 70 alae and cohortes that retained their 2nd-century names, mostly limitanei. But traces of other auxilia regiments {{can be found in the}} praesentales and comitatenses armies. For example, many of the new-style auxilia palatina infantry regiments, considered among the best units in the army, were probably formed from old-style auxiliary cohortes, which <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> closely resemble.|$|E
