500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the {{pay-per-view}} was for the Raw brand, with Triple H, Shawn Michaels and Chris Benoit feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H was the three time reigning World Champion {{heading into the}} WrestleMania XX event, with {{the origins of the}} rivalry beginning on the December 29, 2003 episode of Raw, when Michaels challenged Triple H for the World Title in Michaels' hometown of San Antonio, Texas. It looked as though Michaels was going to win his fifth World Title over Triple H, the Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff came in to the ring at the last minute and made the pinfall, counting to three for what appeared to be Michaels winning the World Heavyweight title. However, as Shawn's shoulders were on the mat {{at the same time as}} Triple H's, the match was declared a draw and Triple H would retain the championship. On January 25, at the Royal Rumble event, Triple H and Michaels faced each other again in a Last Man Standing match for the title, which resulted in a draw, and, as a result, Triple H retained the title, leaving question about who is the better of the two. At the same event, during the Royal Rumble match, SmackDown!'s Benoit won the contest by last eliminating The Big Show. On the following night, Michaels and Triple H were involved in an in-ring confrontation when Raw's authority figure (referred to as the [...] "Sheriff"), Steve Austin, made his way to the ring. As he stated that, although Michaels should have a rematch, he had to [...] "enforce the law" [...] and that even though the Royal Rumble rules gave the winner of the match a shot at [...] "the (world) championship", there was not any specification as to which world title that was. Benoit, who at the time was a member of SmackDown, then came to the ring and said he was taking advantage of that loophole and challenging Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XX. On the February 9 episode of Raw, a contract signing took place between Benoit and World Champion, Triple H. As Triple H signed his name on the paper, Michaels came out to inform Benoit that the last thing he wanted to do is rain on his parade. He then stated that he more than anybody can respect Benoit's effort to win the Royal Rumble match and earning a World title shot but suggested that Benoit could've stayed on SmackDown to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> while Michaels, himself, was trying to finish his 10-year issue with Triple H on behalf of the Raw brand. Benoit refused to relinquish his guaranteed title shot, resulting in Michaels superkicking Benoit and signing the contract himself for the WrestleMania match. After the two men wrestled a match marred by interference from the champion the next week, Austin decided to make Triple H's title defense a Triple threat match. On March 1, after Michaels and Benoit lost to Randy Orton and Batista, Triple H's stablemates in Evolution, the entire group attacked Michaels and Benoit, ending with Triple H nailing them with the Pedigree and rubbing his World title belt into their faces while they were laying motionless in the ring.|$|E
