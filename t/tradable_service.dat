40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{empirical}} approach to identify <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> activities. Contrary to conventional views of service activities as nontradable, we find {{a significant number of}} service industries and occupations that appear tradable and substantial employment in these tradable activities. Workers employed in <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> activities differ from those employed in tradable manufacturing and nontradable services. Workers in <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> activities have higher skill levels and are paid higher wages than manufacturing workers or workers in nontradable service activities. In general, we find little evidence that <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> activities have lower employment growth than other service activities. However, evidence suggests lower employment growth at the lowest end of the skill distribution. There is also evidence of higher worker displacement rates in tradable services. Workers displaced from <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> activities are different from displaced manufacturing workers: Displaced <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> workers have higher skills and higher predisplacement earnings than displaced manufacturing workers. services, offshoring, trade, labor, information technology, jobs...|$|E

40|$|Reduced trade {{barriers}} and lower costs {{of transportation and}} information have meant that a growing {{part of the economy}} has been exposed to international trade. In particular, this is the case in the service sector. We divide the service sector into a tradable and a non-tradable part using an approach to identify tradable industries utilizing a measure of regional concentration of production. We examine whether the probability of displacement is higher and income losses after displacement greater for workers in <b>tradable</b> <b>services</b> and manufacturing (<b>tradable)</b> than in non-tradable services. We also analyze whether the probability of re-employment is higher for workers displaced from <b>tradable</b> <b>services</b> and manufacturing than from non-tradable services. We find that in the 2000 s the probability of displacement is relatively high in <b>tradable</b> <b>services</b> in comparison to non-tradable services and manufacturing. On the other hand, the probability of re-employment is higher for those displaced from <b>tradable</b> <b>services.</b> The largest income losses are found for those who had been displaced from manufacturing. Interestingly, the income losses of those displaced from manufacturing seems mainly to be due to longer spells of non-employment, whereas for those displaced in <b>tradable</b> <b>services</b> lower wages in their new jobs compared to their pre-displacement jobs appears to play a larger role.

40|$|The {{service sector}} is very {{heterogeneous}} {{with respect to}} internationalization; in some industries there is international trade (or it may potentially exist), whereas other industries are non-tradable. Data on international trade in services is, however, typically very limited, {{making it difficult to}} identify in which industries there are international trade. In this paper, we partially surmount the problems with insufficient service trade statistics by calculating locational Ginis for different industries in the private business sector {{as well as in the}} public sector. The basic idea is that from the regional concentration of different activities within a country one can identify industries where there appears to be regional trade, and hence also a potential for international trade. Based on our method we find that the number of employed in <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> appears to be at least as large as in the manufacturing sector. Remarkably, a larger share of the skilled labor exposed to international trade is working in the service sector than in manufacturing, while a majority of the less skilled labor working in tradable industries is employed in manufacturing. When it comes to employment growth, we observe that the employment has increased in <b>tradable</b> <b>service,</b> while it has fallen in the manufacturing sector (the whole sector is regarded as tradable). jobs; service trade; regional concentration; structural change...|$|E

The United States will retain its comparative advantage in high-skill, high-wage production and increase these activities in <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> industries as trade barriers diminish. While the loss of low-wage activities that are offshored and the gain from high-wage service exports will cause dislocation, the globalization of services production is likely to have productivity-enhancing effects similar to the impact of globalization in the manufacturing sector, offering significant potential to improve living standards in the United States and around the world. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper makes three {{contributions}} {{to our understanding}} of the impact of offshoring on aggregate productivity and on labour market outcomes. First, I document that workers in <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> occupations attain more general and more specific human capital.

The dynamic nature of the model allows for differentiation between short and long run effects. The welfare effects of increased offshoring are unambiguously positive; their magnitude depends on the difference between autarky and world relative prices, but not on the skill-content of offshored and inshored tasks. For reasonable terms of trade, the calibrated steady state welfare gains are found to be between 1. 8 % and 4 %. The distribution of the gains from trade critically depends on the time horizon: in the short term, workers with human capital specific to the inshored occupations gain, while workers with human capital specific to the offshored occupations lose. In the long run, the gains from trade are equally distributed among ex-ante identical agents...|$|E

40|$|CARIM-India is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Union. One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes {{in recent years has been}} an evolution in the role of education in the global arena. As education has increasingly assumed the role of a <b>tradable</b> <b>service,</b> countries from all parts of the world have become active participants in the ongoing internationalization of higher education. One of the key outcomes of this process has been the phenomenal growth in international student mobility since 1998. A burgeoning industry which generates revenues of up to 90 billion dollars clearly spells strong financial incentives for participants of this industry. It also implies that factors influencing international student flows have serious implications for the providers as well as consumers of higher education abroad. This paper attempts to address the issue of student mobility between two key stakeholders - India and Europe. In particular, it analyses the trends in student mobility from India to three important markets in Europe – the United Kingdom, Germany and France. The paper identifies various factors which motivate Indian students to pursue higher education abroad, in addition to market features of the host countries which attract them. The paper also identifies the constraints faced by Indian students studying in these countries and concludes with recommendations which, if implemented, can further facilitate the flow of Indian students going to Europe for higher education.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{a relatively recent}} development, the inclusion of education as a <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> under the World Trade Organization 2 ̆ 7 s (WTO 2 ̆ 7 s) General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS). I focus on two Trade in Education Services forums—one in Washington, DC (USA), and one in Sydney (Australia) —to investigate the discursive strategies used to promote trade in education in the multilateral context. I identify the truth regimes that are concretized and the strategies used by both state and nonstate actors to define, codify, and delimit the discourse on trade in education. I argue that these strategies help create the conditions for a broader “epistemic lock in,” where various authorities associated with education are steered toward legitimizing a “new developmentalism,” namely, the reconfiguration of trade liberalization as a developmental tool. By framing the liberalization of trade in education in moral terms, as the means to alleviate global poverty and bridge the development divide, the implications of a GATS-sanctioned commercial agenda are rendered invisible. Using governmentality as a theoretical and methodological framework, I begin the inquiry into the discursive reconstruction of transnational education {{with the question of}} how ideas about trade liberalization are globalized. If globalization is imagined as flows, then what exactly is flowing across transnational education spaces? What kinds of ideas and practices are being transnationalized, and what are their “biopolitical” 1 and geopolitical effects...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of four essays that address important gaps in passenger- and cargo-airline research. Seminal studies in airline economics that rely on cross-section methods make critical homogeneity assumptions and preclude time-specific effects. The essays in this thesis use panel data, which allow for certain assumptions made by cross-sectional studies to be relaxed, while shedding light on the intertemporal features of air transport. The first chapter investigates the cost structure of air cargo carriers by applying a total cost model used in passenger-airline studies. Using quarterly panel data (2003 - 2011) on the domestic operations and costs of FedEx Express and UPS Airlines, empirical {{results indicate that the}} air cargo industry exhibits increasing returns to traffic density and constant returns to scale. Accounting for carrier-specific differences in cost structure and network size, FedEx is found to be more cost efficient than UPS (a finding that is reversed when network size is not controlled). Individually, UPS exhibits substantial economies of density and constant returns to scale while FedEx's cost structure is characterized by weak economies of density and constant returns to scale. Both carriers exhibit economies of size. The next three chapters embody papers that use quarterly panel data of city-level air traffic, airline delay, and socioeconomic variables. Spanning 10 years (2003 - 2012), the panel structure of the data permits the use of fixed effects to control for city-specific heterogeneity. The second chapter presents a paper prepared for the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP). The study demonstrates the within-city traffic impacts of urban size, employment composition, and wages, providing new insights into the determinants of passenger and air cargo traffic. The essay also confirms that airport traffic is proportional to population, and that service-sector employment and higher wages induce passenger travel and goods movement. A city's share of manufacturing employment, however, only impacts air cargo traffic. Passenger enplanements exhibit more sensitivity to the proportion of urban workers providing non-tradable services, compared to the share of workers in <b>tradable</b> <b>service</b> jobs. The third chapter, co-authored with Andre Tok, examines the determinants of air cargo traffic in California. The study uses a shorter 7 -year panel (2003 - 2009), and shows that service and manufacturing employment impact the volume of outbound air cargo. Total (domestic) air cargo traffic is found to grow faster than (proportionally to) population, while wages {{play a significant role in}} determining both total and domestic air cargo movement. Metro-level air cargo tonnage are also forecasted for the years 2010 - 2040, indicating that California's total (domestic) air cargo traffic will increase at an average rate of 5. 9 percent (4. 4 percent) per year in that period. The final chapter is co-authored with Volodymyr Bilotkach, and it provides the first evidence on the impact of airline delays on urban-sectoral employment. Controlling for unobserved city-specific differences, the empirical estimates of the effects of air traffic on total employment are comparable to previously reported measures. However, service-sector employment is found to be less sensitive to air traffic than other studies suggested. New evidence confirming that delays have a negative impact on employment is also provided, a finding that is robust to various model specifications...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters, which focus jointly {{on the effects of}} education policy on the functioning of labor markets. De-industrialization and technological progress have changed job markets fundamentally. The most fundamental change is that the concept of a worker as a unit of production relatively insensitive to inherent characteristics has been overthrown. Service sectors that have taken over from manufacturing as the engines of economic activity rely primarily on human capital for autonomous production. This is especially true for internationally <b>tradable</b> <b>services.</b> Their stark development was rendered possible by the informationcommunication revolution. Skills and talent, as well as their allocation to suitable tasks matter for production, now more than ever. We argue in this dissertation that the ability of education policy to facilitate optimal task allocation plays a role in maximizing aggregate production and in influencing education earnings premia, as well as employment volumes in various sectors of activity.
