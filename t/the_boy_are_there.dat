6000|$|... "Oh, well, {{you know}} you stopped me playing a quiet game at home, and {{three or four of}} <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> Then a Brandon {{real-estate}} man asked for the cards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'll go {{myself to}} this place which M'liss wishes to make a secret of and see if <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>is</b> <b>there.</b> It will save trouble to any one else, if she should be mistaken." ...|$|R
60|$|As he slid off, {{his legs}} {{felt as if}} they did not belong to him, and his back ached so that he could scarce {{straighten}} it. The Rajah and his sons had returned to the palace, and <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> waiting for him.|$|R
6000|$|The mob stood silent, paralyzed with surprise. Jack {{had spoken}} without {{a tinge of}} the local accent, and as none of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> his voice <b>was</b> quite unrecognized. [...] "Who be he?" [...] "It's a stranger!" [...] and other sentences, were muttered through the throng.|$|R
60|$|Jonas {{walked on}} {{until he came}} out of the woods, at the house where he had seen <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> cut wood. As he {{approached}} the place, he saw that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> still; but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a man with him. The man had a goad-stick in his hand.|$|R
60|$|Ken {{ran into}} his room, {{closed the door}} and then peeped out. He saw Raymond slowly sag down-stairs as if his heart was broken. Then Ken slipped out and crawled down the hall till he could see into the reading-room. All <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> with anxious faces, crowded round the coach. Worry was livid. Reddy Ray seemed the only calm person in the room and he had tragedy written all over him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{imagine that}} Frank's notion is correct," [...] he said. [...] "As Harry told you, he and Frank once {{paid a visit}} to the Chinese camp near our ranch where he saw the man with the high {{shoulder}} and followed him to a shack from which he disappeared. If the Chinaman who crept into the room chanced to have been about the camp when <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> it's quite possible that he did wish to see Harry's face." ...|$|R
60|$|When old Salim {{reached the}} city, he soon found that Alberdin and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> had <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> {{and that they}} had gone away together.|$|R
50|$|A {{co-education}} {{system was}} in place until the 1990s but after the establishment of Excelsior College, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> shifted <b>there</b> and from then onwards only girls were admitted to this prestigious school.|$|R
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a knock at the}} door and I hurried out. <b>The</b> postmaster's <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> with a telegram. I tore it open, glanced at it, and dashed back into the room.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was well}} taken care of. I made him have a nurse about 3 months ago {{as he was}} dirty & {{neglected}} & he had Watson who was most devoted & the Symonds were as nice as {{they knew how to}} be. At the last Mrs. McAlpine & <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> I saw him the day he died, but he did not recognize me.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> laughed. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> a silence. He flushed deeply, and ate in silence.|$|R
60|$|Toby was {{completely}} bewildered by this sudden disappearance, {{and for some}} moments he stood looking {{at the place where}} he had left his friend, as if he thought that his eyes must have deceived him, and that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>was</b> still <b>there.</b>|$|R
60|$|The pertly-put {{question}} {{was addressed to}} Paul Bevan, between whom and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> evidently strong affection.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a {{road through}} the woods which ran almost {{directly}} to the fair grounds.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> all <b>there,</b> {{kneeling}} in their places. He knelt among them, happy and shy. The altar was heaped with fragrant masses of white flowers; {{and in the}} morning light the pale flames of the candles among the white flowers were clear and silent as his own soul.|$|R
60|$|The title deeds {{had been}} left with Farmer Kenniston, while <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> away, and <b>there</b> could <b>be</b> no {{question}} as to their proprietorship.|$|R

6000|$|... "I haven't {{been over}} to the navy-yard for several years," [...] remarked Phil Newell, as they rode along. [...] "I used to know several of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> that <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> but they've grown too old for the service. I reckon the yard is a busy place these days." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> that night, {{about the}} {{appointed}} time. They {{sat in the}} shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated {{up out of the}} distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At last Tom said: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, Rose, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> right. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> {{still some}} hope; let us cling {{to it as}} long as we can. Now let us be moving: but before we go, let us all thank God for having saved us from harm so far, and let us pray for His {{protection}} and help upon the road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And with {{everything}} to learn, {{in such a}} scene as that! The first day, when only <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> ill, <b>there</b> sat <b>the</b> girl, dabbling with her water-colours, and her petticoats reaching half across the room, looking like a milliner's doll, and neither she nor her poor mother dreaming of her doing a useful matter.' ...|$|R

Having already undergone a mastectomy, she has decided that she will no longer endure chemotherapy and must accept her inevitable death. The couple have no children, partly due to Megan's illness {{and partly because of}} Tom's job. Tom is unable to deal with his wife's illness and implores her to continue treatment.

50|$|Batman openly defied Governor Arthur and Augustus Robinson {{by refusing}} to hand over two Aboriginal boys in his employ: Rolepana (or Benny Ben Lomond) and Lurnerminer (John or Jack Allen), {{captured}} by Batman in 1828. He claimed <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> with <b>the</b> consent of their parents,....He also demonstrated a strong proprietorial interest in <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> when he told Robinson they were 'as much his property as his farm {{and that he had}} as much right to keep them as the government'. Indeed Batman was convinced that the best plan was to leave the children with the colonists, who clothed and fed them at no expense to the government and raised them to become 'useful members of society'. In a series of letters to Governor Arthur, he 'pleaded hard for the retention of youths educated by settlers and devoted to their service'.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{see why we}} shouldn't be able to do, that. According to <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> story <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only three, without {{counting}} this man, {{therefore the}} forces are equal in numbers." ...|$|R
