5|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of German {{airborne}} operations during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a force of 5,000 parachute troops. As a result, on 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando assumed parachute duties, and on 21 November was re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing. <b>This</b> <b>later</b> became the 1st Parachute Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns <b>this</b> <b>later</b> she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T.

Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Part I of The Age of Reason was {{published}} in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the French Revolution. The Reign of Terror had begun, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been tried and executed and Britain was at war with France. Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. The Age of Reason belongs to <b>this</b> <b>later,</b> more radical stage of the British political reform movement, one that openly embraced republicanism and atheism and is exemplified by such texts as William Godwin's Political Justice (1793). By {{the middle of the}} decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: Richard Price, the Dissenting minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), had died in 1791, and Joseph Priestley had been forced to flee to America after a Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source {{from the period}} is the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to KennethII (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to <b>this,</b> <b>later</b> king lists survive. The earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date {{from the end of}} the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to <b>this</b> <b>later</b> period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became {{a significant source of}} employment, although <b>this</b> <b>later</b> declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence for the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Following Seven Assignments Clarke {{then took}} a job at Conservative Central Office, as Head of Public Opinion Research, where he worked until 1952.

The following year he submitted a publisher's proposal for The Secret War, a full account of deception during the Second World War, but was prevented from writing it by the Official Secrets Act. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955.|$|E

5|$|From the 9th century, Nuskhuri script {{starting}} becoming dominant, and {{the role}} of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, epigraphic monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued to be written in Asomtavruli script. Asomtavruli in <b>this</b> <b>later</b> period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script, Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters. Although, some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{the airline}} transported 14,000 people {{and had a}} revenue of NOK17 million, {{allowing}} Krohn Air to break even. On 14 February 2011, the company increased the service from Molde to Trondheim from two to four daily services in each direction, from Monday through Thursday. From 2010 to 2012 the airline had an accumulated loss of NOK3.3 million. <b>This</b> <b>later</b> was reduced back to a typical twice-daily schedule. A twice-daily route from Ålesund to Trondheim was introduced on 3 March 2013.

The company had a revenue of NOK19 million in 2013. Krohn Air ceased all operations on 4 February 2014, and filed for bankruptcy the following day.

Pelé was the guest of honour at Sheffield's anniversary match against Inter Milan, which Inter won 5–2 at Bramall Lane. As part of his visit, Pelé opened an exhibition which included the first public showing in 40 years of the original hand-written rules of football. Pelé scouted for Premier League club Fulham in 2002. He made the draw for the qualification groups for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals. On 1 August 2010, Pelé was introduced as the Honorary President of a revived New York Cosmos, aiming to field a team in Major League Soccer. In August 2011, ESPN reported that Santos were considering bringing him out of retirement for a cameo role in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, although <b>this</b> <b>later</b> {{turned out to be}} false.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) system. The bar-and-dot {{counting}} system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC; the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic, and added the symbol for zero. This {{may have been the}} earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide, although it may have been predated by the Babylonian system. The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD. In its earliest uses, the zero served as a place holder, indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count. <b>This</b> <b>later</b> developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation, and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years, until its use was extinguished by the Spanish.|$|E
