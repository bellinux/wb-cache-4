25|$|Pakistan is {{a largely}} rural society (almost {{two thirds of}} the {{population}} lives in rural areas) and women are rarely formally employed. This does not mean <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not participate in the economy: quite on the contrary, women usually work on the farm of the household, practice subsistence agriculture, or otherwise work within the household economic unit. However, women are often prevented from advancing economically, due to social restrictions on women's movement and gender mixing, as well as due to low education.|$|E

25|$|During the {{resolution}} phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, {{and the body}} returns to its resting state. Though generally reported <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first, some sources state that {{both men and women}} experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. This period may last from minutes to days and is typically longer for men than women.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative halakha {{committee}} in Israel has ruled <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not receive such aliyot and cannot validly perform such functions (rabbi Robert Harris, 5748). Therefore, not all Conservative congregations or rabbis permit these roles for bnot kohanim (daughters of priests). Moreover, many egalitarian-oriented Conservative synagogues have abolished traditional tribal roles {{and do not}} perform ceremonies involving kohanim (such as the Priestly Blessing or calling a kohen to the first aliyah), and many traditionalist Conservative synagogues have retained traditional gender roles and do not permit women to perform these roles at all.|$|E
25|$|According to Masters and Johnson, {{women have}} the ability to orgasm again very quickly, {{as long as they have}} {{effective}} stimulation. As a result, they are able to have multiple orgasms in a relatively short period of time. Though generally reported <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first, some sources state that men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. For some women, the clitoris is very sensitive after climax, making additional stimulation initially painful. After the initial orgasm, subsequent orgasms for women may also be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates.|$|E
50|$|In 1912, Karl Staff {{presented}} a motion of women's suffrage, which was voted {{down by the}} Conservatives, while the Liberals and Social Democrats voted yes.

Their naked bodies are found the following day in a botanic garden, posed to resemble the story of Adam and Eve. The Millennium Group, a private investigative firm, [...] despatches offender profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Maureen Murphy (Harriet Sansom Harris) to aid the police investigation.

500|$|Critic Yukari Fujimoto {{says that}} Sakura {{is an example}} of Naruto showing a {{conservative}} view of women. [...] Ino, Sakura and Hinata place priority on love, treating it as more important than excelling as a ninja. [...] Fujimoto states that during the ninja examinations, Sakura's climactic fight with Ino, her love rival, is conducted on a purely physical level, contrasting this level of skill with the supernatural abilities displayed by her male classmates at this point. [...] When the medical ninja Tsunade is introduced, Sakura takes on a daughter-like role, learning to heal others from Tsunade teaching, which Fujimoto regards as reinforcing a conservative idea of women - <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not belong on the battlefield as warriors, only as nurses.|$|E

2500|$|Linda Woodhead {{claims that}} the modern [...] "egalitarian {{emphasis}} is contradicted by a symbolic framework that elevates the male over the female, and by organizational arrangements that make masculine domination a reality in church life.

2500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good for You" [...] {{was directed by}} Sophie Muller. In the video, Gomez wanted to represent her journey to womanhood and to promote female empowerment — which she felt strongly about and wanted to depict in a raw and vulnerable way. With the clip, she wanted to prove that young women should not be self-conscious of their sex appeal or be obliged to wear lingerie to feel attractive. [...] "I feel like people here, especially guys are like, 'Ah, lingerie and sexy.' I think being sexy {{as a young woman}} or girl, is not caring what other people think, wearing like casual things, feeling sexy". The singer felt it was important to collaborate with a female director as a means of female empowerment and wanted the visual to be raw and vulnerable. She was also drawn to jeans and T-shirt attire and believed it would prove to women that they need not dress in lingerie to feel attractive. She chose the video to be specifically about her, absent of a love interest or men, to reflect the song's meaning of female self-empowerment. She later said Muller [...] "created a beautiful and intimate visual representation" [...] of [...] "Good for You". Speaking of the music video's theme, Gomez stated, [...] "It's very jeans and a T-shirt, moments where a woman is deep in thought, or in a moment where she's in this crazy little rage. It just captures real things <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do.</b> There {{are a lot of things}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> that are sexy that aren't just the typical, cheap way of being sexy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Masters and Johnson {{argued that}} all women are {{potentially}} multiply orgasmic, but that multiply orgasmic men are rare, {{and stated that}} [...] "the female is capable of rapid return to orgasm immediately following an orgasmic experience, if restimulated before tensions have dropped below plateau phase response levels". Though generally reported <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first one, some sources state that {{both men and women}} experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.

On the contrary, we verify <b>that</b> <b>women</b> singers and improvisators always sung and took active part in this field.

2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even if you have not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just because we want to take better care of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the media, {{the ideal}} {{version of a}} man {{is seen as a}} strong, toned man. The {{idealized}} version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes. The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism. Self-objectification, which {{is the way in which}} we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women. [...] Men typically experience it through media display. [...] The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{second shift}} {{focuses on the}} idea that women {{theoretically}} work a second shift in the manner of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work. All of the task that are engaged in outside the workplace are mainly tied to motherhood. Depending on location, household income, educational attainment, ethnicity and location. Data shows <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>do</b> work a second shift in the sense of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work, but this is not apparent if simultaneous activity is overlooked. Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein as early as 1956 focused on the potential of both men and women working in settings that included paid and unpaid types of work environments. Research indicated that men and women could have equal time for activities outside the work environment for family and extra activities. This [...] "second shift" [...] has also been found to have physical effects as well, especially for women. Women whom engage in longer hours in pursuit of family balance, often suffer more mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and other problems. Irritability, low motivation and energy, and other emotional issues have been found as well. The overall happiness of women can be improved if the balance of career and home responsibilities are met.|$|E
