25|$|The {{basic design}} of the Cheetah {{remained}} unchanged from its introduction in 1935 to the last examples built in 1948. It was the first engine of its type to be certified for 1,200 hours of operational <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhauls</b> (TBO), with over 37,200 examples built.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a throttle body injector system with a tuned intake manifold and dual electronic ignition, or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} throttle body injector to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhauls.</b> Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and roller tappets.|$|E
25|$|The Air Ministry {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the accident under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations, 1922. The investigation opened on 25 June at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, with Sir Arthur Colefax in charge. The cause of the engine failure was the fracture of No. 4 connecting rod in the starboard engine. The engine had run for 126 hours since its last overhaul, with the permitted <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhauls</b> being 300 hours. The connecting rod had failed due to the failure of the big end bearing studs.|$|E

25|$|The {{first flight}} of the Il-18 was made on 18 August 1946, in a sixty-passenger configuration, even though the turbosuperchargers for its engines had not been fitted. To save time Sergey Ilyushin gave the order to {{commence}} flight tests without them. However, this proved to be in vain because the manufacturer's flight tests were not concluded until 30 July 1947 as the turbo-superchargers were not delivered in a timely manner. Other problems were the short <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhauls</b> for the ASh-73TKs, initially only 25 hours, and the disintegration of one engine on 25 June 1947. Flight characteristics were docile and the passenger cabin proved {{to be far more}} comfortable than those of the Lisunov Li-2, the C-47 Skytrain or the Il-12. It had a comfortable margin of power that allowed it to continue to cruise if one or even two engines weren't running. Its engines were in short supply as they were needed to power the Tupolev Tu-4 and they were not yet reliable enough for economical use so the aircraft was canceled.|$|E
25|$|Long {{aluminium}} beadings on {{the sides}} were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive's high sides appear more slender {{and add to the}} impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each nose, in the same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive's styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD E-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight was to have been fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating 'Mars Light' type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, derated from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total. This derating reduced the stress on the engines, thereby increasing the service life and length of <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhauls.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The AI-20 is a {{single-shaft}} turboprop with a ten-stage {{axial compressor}} and a three-stage power turbine, {{and is designed}} to run at a constant speed. A big problem with early production engines was the poor reliability of the AI-20 engines, which had a <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>overhauls</b> (TBO) {{in the range of}} 600 to 750 hours. The AI-20K engine variant was finally introduced, with a TBO of 2,000 hours – unimpressive by modern standards, but a big improvement. One issue that was never addressed was noise; turboprops are relatively noisy and high noise levels were a [...] problem for the passengers. As mentioned, the overhaul life of the engine was initially poor compared with contemporary western engines, being reported as 600–750 hours in 1964, but was later improved by continuous development to 8,000 hours, with a service life of 22,000 hours in the AI-20D series 5M.|$|E
