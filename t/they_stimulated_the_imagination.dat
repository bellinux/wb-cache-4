40|$|In this article, I {{reconsider the}} {{significance}} of Daniel Burnham’s contribution to the professionalization of city planning in light of contemporaneous practices of viewing and depicting the city from above. A {{closer look at the}} working methods employed and images produced by Burnham and his staff reveals their role in cultivating a shared civic imaginary. That is, drawing upon existing widespread cultural enthusiasm for viewing the city from above, <b>they</b> <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> toward the city as it might be, while positioning themselves as new kinds of experts tasked with reconciling discrepancies between the built and imagined city on behalf of the public. I structure the article in particular around the discussion of three images: San Francisco as envisaged from the Twin Peaks viewing platform, published in Report on a Plan for San Francisco (1905); a bird’s-eye view of Chicago as envisaged in a watercolor by Jules Guerin, published in The Plan of Chicago (1909); and a Chicago civic center as envisaged in another watercolor by Jules Guerin, published in The Plan of Chicago (1909). Through formal and discursive consideration of these images, I argue that a burgeoning sense of the civic imaginary shared by professionals, elites, and ordinary citizens {{played a crucial role in}} the institution of the city-planning profession in the first decade of the twentieth century. Regardless of the specific details and subsequent status of the plans to which they refer, the images are important to consider in their own right. As instruments in a recasting of urban form, they materialize a new sense of the city as both malleable and the object of concern for a new kind of specialist...|$|E
60|$|So far we {{have been}} dealing only with the Saracenic share in the European revival. Let us {{turn now to the}} {{influence}} of <b>the</b> Mongol conquests. <b>They</b> <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> geographical <b>imagination</b> of Europe enormously. For a time under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western Europe enjoyed an open intercourse; all the roads were temporarily open, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of Karakorum. The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered. Great hopes were entertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to Christianity. Their only religion so far had been Shumanism, a primitive paganism. Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priests from India, Parisian and Italian and Chinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian merchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian astronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court. We hear too much in history of the campaigns and massacres of the Mongols, and not enough of their curiosity and desire for learning. Not perhaps as an originative people, but as transmitters {299} of knowledge and method their influence upon the world's history has been very great. And everything one can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or Kublai tends to confirm the impression that these men were at least as understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but egotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian Charlemagne.|$|R
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. <b>They</b> also <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> readers' <b>imaginations</b> to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|R
5000|$|Tanghalang Ateneo, the longest-running {{theater company}} of the Loyola Schools, Ateneo de Manila University, weaves into its work the {{theatrical}} traditions of the University’s sesquicentennial past: the devotion of the salon de actos at the Escuela Municipal, the eloquence of the Ateneo Dramatics Guild, the joie de vivre of the Ateneo Players Theater, and the innovative spirit of the Ateneo Experimental Theater. Like these companies, Tanghalang Ateneo uses theater to foster eloquentia, sapientia, and humanitas - the pillars of Jesuit pedagogy. It sees itself as a theater company {{in the service of}} student formation, and by extension - given the Jesuit ideal of magis - a theater in service of the nation. Since its founding in 1972 (and formally recognized five years later), Tanghalang Ateneo has grown from a fledgling band of student players to one of the country’s leading school-based theater companies. Its repertoire of plays is daunting: world classics, Filipino originals, and documentary texts turned into theater pieces. Its productions are noted for thought, generosity, and energy, while its lingua franca on stage are Filipino and English. Its members come from diverse academic fields. In fact, many have pursued careers in theater, television, and film; many more use their theater experience to excel in management, law, teaching, media, and cultural work. Acclaimed professional actors have graced its shows, and several outstanding designers and choreographers have served as members of its artistic staff. To name a few, Naty Crame-Rogers, Irma Adlawan, Nonie Buencamino, Teroy Guzman, Bodjie Pascua, Frances Makil-Ignacio, Floy Quintos, Myra Beltran, Leeroy New, and Gino Gonzales have worked with the company in previous seasons. [...] In addition, Tanghalang Ateneo has won two Aliw Awards for Best Production and another two for Best Direction for its 2008 and 2011 productions of Glenn Sevilla Mas's [...] "The Death of Memory" [...] (Direction: Ricardo G. Abad) and [...] "Sintang Dalisay" [...] (Direction: Ricardo G. Abad). Last year, the company received several citations, including two for the year's 10 Best Productions, in the Philippine Daily Inquirer's Best of Theater 2014 for its productions of Han Ong's [...] "Middle Finger" [...] (Direction: Ed Lacson, Jr.) and Glenn Sevilla Mas's [...] "Rite of Passage: Sa Pagtubu kang Tahud" [...] (Direction: Ron Capinding). The company has also received production grants from the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the Loyola Schools, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the Spanish Program for Cultural Cooperation, and the Japan Foundation. Furthermore, Tanghalang Ateneo continues to make itself known from the microenvironment of the Ateneo de Manila University, garnering nominations such as Project of the Year and Best Organization in the Council of the Organizations of the Ateneo de Manila University (COA) Awards. Its shows have also been shown in campuses and venues across the country and abroad, notably in Shanghai and Taiwan as part of the Festival of the Asian Pacific Bureau of Theatre Schools, and in Belarus, Minsk for the International University Theatre Association Student Theatre Festival. The company’s past achievements have also facilitated the creation, in SY 2000-2001, of a degree program in Theater Arts within the Fine Arts Program of the Ateneo de Manila University. Tanghalang Ateneo products educate and delight; <b>they</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> and provoke thought. Jesuit pedagogy fuses with theater arts to interrogate the Filipino social world so that students can invent themselves as critical Filipinos: sharp in thought, expressive in action, deep in faith and attuned to others - fellow players and audiences whose lives intersect with their own. National Artist for Theater Design Salvador Bernal, Doreen Fernandez, and Nenita Escasa were among the company’s advisers in the early years. Ricardo Saludo became the first Artistic Director and Moderator when Tanghalang Ateneo gained university recognition in 1979. Dr. Ricardo G. Abad succeeded him and became the company's longest-serving Artistic Director and Moderator (1984-2013). In 2014, Glenn Sevilla Mas came aboard and became the company's new Artistic Director and Moderator.|$|R
40|$|Fairytales are an {{indispensable}} part in children's lives. <b>They</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>imagination,</b> fantasy; they help to enrich children’s vocabulary and with expressing feelings. There are {{different types of}} fairytales {{and it is very}} important that children get to know the variety of them. I firstly presented a youth author Anja Štefan and her literary works in my diploma paper. Later on I continued with the presentation of youth literature and I defined the theory of a fairytale, wrote about the origin, its meaning and classification of fairytales which I have also described in greater detail. I stated and described authorial prose work of Anja Štefan: picture book Lešniki, lešniki and classic fairytales Kotiček na koncu sveta, Melje, melje mlinček and Štiri črne mravljice, which can be defined as animal fairytales. I was interested in the receptive development of children in the period of intuitive intelligence, which I thoroughly described. In the empirical part of my diploma I wrote lesson plans for discussing and teaching three Anja Štefan’s animal fairytales in the first grade of primary school. 25 children took part in the research. I found out that pupils distinguish between real and unreal life (imaginative life), they are capable of identifying themselves with a literary person and they perceive animals as literary persons and they identify themselves with them...|$|R
