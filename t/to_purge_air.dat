Around 400 experiments were done including all possible dual purging locations and the location which gives least mixing time was identified. The results were compared with corresponding single purging experiments and it was found that dual purging can reduce mixing time to a great extent even in the lower flowrate range and a location better than +/- R/ 2 has been suggested. Effect of differential flow on mixing time has also been reported...|$|R

30|$|For the {{synthesis}} of tapered CdS nanobelts, CdS powders (Strem Chemicals, 99.999 %) placed in a ceramic boat was put {{at the center of}} a quartz tube, which was inserted into a horizontal tube furnace. The silicon wafer coated with ~ 2 nm Au film was perpendicularly placed on the other ceramic boat located downstream, 10 cm away from the source material. Prior to heating, high-purity Ar was introduced into the quartz tube <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the <b>air</b> inside for 60 min. After that, a carrier gas of high-purity Ar mixed with 5 % H 2 was kept flowing at a rate of 60 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute). The furnace was heated to 800 °C with a heating rate of 100 °C min− 1 and maintained at this temperature for 40 min. Then, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature slowly (~ 5 °C min− 1).

40|$|CIGS {{solar cells}} were exposed <b>to</b> liquid water <b>purged</b> with the {{atmospheric}} gases carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxygen (O 2), nitrogen (N 2) and air {{in order to}} investigate their chemical degradation behavior. The samples were analyzed by electrical, compositional and optical measurements before, during and after exposure in order to follow the degradation behavior of these solar cells in time. The solar cells showed a rapid decrease in conversion efficiency when exposed <b>to</b> water <b>purged</b> {{with a combination of}} CO 2 and N 2 as well as <b>to</b> water <b>purged</b> with <b>air,</b> while their efficiency was slowly reduced in unpurged water and water purged with N 2 or O 2. Cross-section SEM showed that the exposure of samples to H 2 O with large concentrations of CO 2 led to the dissolution of the ZnO:Al layer, likely starting from the grain boundaries. This resulted in an increased series resistance, which is likely related to an increase in resistivity of the ZnO:Al layer. It also led to a very rapid decrease of the short-circuit current of these samples. Therefore, the conversion efficiency was rapidly lost. cop. 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The cryogenic propellant tanks for both concepts use welded, blade-stiffened aluminum skins for leak-free containment and compatibility with LOX and LH 2. The tanks are sized primarily by pressure, although some areas are sized by bending and fracture mechanics considerations. The tank concept is regarded as state-of-the-art, even though it requires a closed cell foam insulation with a dry <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> <b>to</b> prevent <b>air</b> liquefaction and ice formation. It is noted that the foam will require testing to verify its design life for use in the STS. One concept has nonintegral tanks suspended inside an insulated aluminum airframe and thrust structure. Here, a durable thermal protection system external insulation is mechanically attached to the airframe, allowing a buckled skin design. The other concept uses a novel structural arrangement consisting of a separate tank/thrust structure that supports a hot advanced-carbon-carbon aeroshell structure...|$|R
500|$|In April 1977, Alyeska filed {{a notice}} that it {{intended}} to start filling the pipeline sometime between June 20 and July 1. Engineers {{had to face}} several problems when filling the pipeline. First was the need to balance temperatures: Filled by air, the steel pipeline was about [...] degrees. The oil emerging from wells at Prudhoe Bay was more than [...] degrees, {{and there was a}} danger that if it was introduced before intermediate warming, the pipeline could crack because of thermal expansion. The second problem came when the pipeline needed <b>to</b> be <b>purged</b> of <b>air</b> {{in order to reduce the}} danger of fire or explosion. Usually, a pipeline is filled with water first, and the oil pushes the water ahead of it, purging the pipeline as it goes. In Alaska, there was a fear that the water would freeze in the pipeline, damaging it. This problem was solved when pressurized nitrogen was used instead of water.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to ascertain if 1) baseline emission and 2) damage induced emission of volatile plant substances could be detected under greenhouse conditions. A laboratory method was validated for analysing the air in a semi-closed greenhouse with 44 m 2 floor area. This greenhouse, with a volume of 270 m 3, was climate controlled and light was supplied with assimilation lamps. Sixty tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill cv. Moneymaker) were grown in this greenhouse. These plants were artificially damaged on a weekly interval by stroking the stems. Continuous flow pumps were used <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the <b>air</b> surrounding the plants through tubes containing an adsorbent. This sampling step was performed before and directly after damage of the plants. After sampling, the tubes were transferred to the lab for analysis. The analysis of volatile compounds was performed using a high-throughput gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. The method enabled the detection of baseline level emission and the emission of volatiles released after artificially damaging the tomato plants during a 6 weeks growing period. Most dominant compounds for baseline emission were the monoterpenes ß-phellandrene, 2 -carene, limonene, ¿-phellandrene and ¿-pinene. Directly after damage, these compounds showed an increase of up to 100 times compared to baseline level emission. With these results, we prove {{that it is possible to}} detect baseline- and plant damage induced volatile emission in a greenhouse. This area of research is promising but more research needs to be done to determine whether it is possible to detect plant damage due to pests and pathogens using volatile sensing...|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling technique {{was applied to the}} estimation of maximum benzene concentration for the vapor space inside a large-scaled and high-level radioactive waste tank at Savannah River site (SRS). The objective of the work was to perform the calculations for the benzene mixing behavior in the vapor space of Tank 48 {{and its impact on the}} local concentration of benzene. The calculations were used to evaluate the degree <b>to</b> which <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> mixes with benzene evolving from the liquid surface and its ability to prevent an unacceptable concentration of benzene from forming. The analysis was focused on changing the tank operating conditions to establish internal recirculation and changing the benzene evolution rate from the liquid surface. The model used a three-dimensional momentum coupled with multi-species transport. The calculations included potential operating conditions for air inlet and exhaust flows, recirculation flow rate, and benzene evolution rate with prototypic tank geometry. The flow conditions are assumed to be fully turbulent since Reynolds numbers for typical operating conditions are in the range of 20, 000 to 70, 000 based on the inlet conditions of the <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> system. A standard two-equation turbulence model was used. The modeling results for the typical gas mixing problems available in the literature were compared and verified through comparisons with the test results. The benchmarking results showed that the predictions are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and literature data. Additional sensitivity calculations included a reduced benzene evolution rate, reduced air inlet and exhaust flow, and forced internal recirculation. The modeling results showed that the vapor space was fairly well mixed and that benzene concentrations were relatively low when forced recirculation and 72 cfm ventilation air through the tank boundary were imposed. For the same 72 cfm air inlet flow but without forced recirculation, the heavier benzene gas was stratified. The results demonstrated that benzene concentrations were relatively low for typical operating configurations and conditions. Detailed results and the cases considered in the calculations will be discussed here...|$|R
40|$|Conference on Metrology, Inspection, and Process Control for Microlithography XXVIII, San Jose, CA, FEB 24 - 27, 2014 International audienceRefractory {{compounds}} such as Trimethylsilanol (TMS) {{and other}} organic compounds such as propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) used in the photolithography area of microelectronic cleanrooms have irreversible dramatic impact on optical lenses used on photolithography tools. There {{is a need for}} real-time, continuous measurements of organic contaminants in representative cleanroom environment especially in lithography zone. Such information is essential to properly evaluate the impact of organic contamination on optical lenses. In this study, a Proton-Transfer Reaction-Time-of-Flight Mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) was applied for real-time and continuous monitoring of fugitive organic contamination induced by the fabrication process. Three types of measurements were carried out using the PTR-TOF-MS in order to detect the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) next to the tools in the photolithography area and at the upstream and downstream of chemical filters used <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the <b>air</b> in the cleanroom environment. A validation and verification of the results obtained with PTR-TOF-MS was performed by comparing these results with those obtained with an off-line technique that is Automated Thermal Desorber - Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (ATD-GC-MS) used as a reference analytical method. The emerged results from the PTR-TOF-MS analysis exhibited the temporal variation of the VOCs levels in the cleanroom environment during the fabrication process. While comparing the results emerging from the two techniques, a good agreement was found between the results obtained with PTR-TOF-MS and those obtained with ATD-GC-MS for the PGMEA, toluene and xylene. Regarding TMS, a significant difference was observed ascribed to the technical performance of both instruments...|$|R

Degradation was the most severe on positions where the molybdenum was mechanically damaged and the MoSe 2 film was removed before exposure, for example {{in the middle of the}} P 3 scribe.

40|$|A {{major concern}} in the {{operation}} of present-day gas turbine engines is the ingestion of hot mainstream gas into rotor-stator disk cavities of the high-pressure turbine stages. Although the engines require high gas temperature at turbine entry for good performance efficiency, the ingested gas shortens the lives of the cavity internals, particularly that of the rotor disks. Steps such as installing seals at the disk rims and injecting <b>purge</b> (secondary) <b>air</b> bled from the compressor discharge into the cavities are implemented to reduce the gas ingestion. Although there are advantages to the above-mentioned steps, the performance of a gas turbine engine is diminished by the <b>purge</b> <b>air</b> bleed-off.

40|$|Ionization {{chambers}} {{are widely}} used for measuring tritium in the gas phase. Recently, however, it has been perceived that the contamination of the chamber wall due to the adsorption of tritium significantly impairs {{the reliability of the}} ionization chambers when they are used for measuring tritium at high concentrations. As a first step to overcome this difficulty, we studied the contamination of ionization chambers with tritium gas (HT) and/or tritiated water vapor (HTO) by using different component materials (Cu, Ni-plated, and Au-plated chambers). In case of the Cu chamber, the concentration of tritium gas in the chamber decreased exponentially with time due <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> by fresh <b>air</b> <b>to</b> a certain level. Then, the decrease rate slowed down drastically (the memory effect). This is caused by adsorption of tritiated water {{on the surface of the}} material; the tritiated water being formed in the chamber due to exchange reaction with water vapor. In case of the Ni-plated chamber, the memory effect was also observed; however, this is not due to the adsorbed tritiated water. Instead, it is thought to due to adsorbed tritium such as T(a) or HT(a). With respect to the Au-plated chamber, no memory effect took place when it was exposed to tritium gas (HT). On the other hand, when the chambers were exposed to tritiated water vapor, all showed a large memory effect. It was clarified that the memory effect principally arose from the physically adsorbed tritiated water. In conclusion, the Au-plated chamber is most preferable for measuring tritium gas. However, the memory effect due to the adsorption of tritiated water vapor is as large as that for the other two. Therefore, it is necessary to develop suitable decontamination methods for the contamination will have to be avoided by the selection of more suitable materials...|$|R
