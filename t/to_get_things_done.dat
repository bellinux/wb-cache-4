Hank Paulson, the U.S. Treasury Secretary for the Bush administration, said he enjoyed Frank's penchant for brokering deals, [...] "he is looking <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> {{and make a}} difference, he focuses on areas of agreement and tries to build on those." ...|$|E
500|$|Divine's mother, Frances Milstead, {{remarked that}} while Divine [...] "was blessed with many talents and abilities, {{he could be}} very moody and demanding." [...] She noted {{that while he was}} [...] "incredibly kind and generous", he always wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> the way that he wanted, and would [...] "tune you out if you displeased him." [...] She noted that in most interviews, he came across as [...] "a very shy and private person". Divine's Dutch friends gave him two bulldogs in the early 1980s, on which he doted, naming them Beatrix and Claus after Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus of the Netherlands. On {{numerous}} occasions he would have his photograph taken with them and sometimes use these images for record covers and posters. Divine suffered from problems with obesity from childhood, caused by his love of food, and in later life his hunger was increased by his daily use of marijuana, an addiction that he publicly admitted to. According to Bernard Jay, in Divine's final years, when his disco career {{was coming to an end}} and he was struggling to find acting jobs, he felt suicidal and threatened to kill himself on several occasions.|$|E

500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done,</b> to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E

2500|$|After the June 1968 election, he was {{appointed}} Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development {{largely because of the}} influence of Sharp, who had persuaded Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau that Chrétien was worthy of a senior portfolio in the cabinet. Trudeau and Chrétien were never close or even friendly as the gulf between the intellectual Trudeau and the decidedly non-intellectual Chrétien was too wide, but Trudeau did value Chrétien as an extremely loyal and competent minister, and as a [...] "tough guy" [...] trouble-shooter who could handle difficult assignments.

2500|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} in the Chinese legal community that the endemic corruption {{is caused by the}} lack of an independent judiciary and a failure to enforce laws and regulations. They contend that these problems will not be permanently fixed until much deeper systemic problems are addressed. Guanxi and other social customs, may have also contributed to the prevalence of practices seen as corrupt from a strictly legal perspective but seem relatively benign from a cultural standpoint. Gift-giving during holidays, securing patrons for career advancement, hosting banquets at expensive restaurants to secure minor deals, exchanging favours, and navigating the complex web of guanxi <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> <b>done</b> was seen as an ordinary part of Chinese life. Indeed, many people did not see these activities as illegal or even morally problematic.
