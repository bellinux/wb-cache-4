A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was that in every scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she could present only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound truck that had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the weather deck port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and <b>the</b> <b>glitter</b> of hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E

Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album.

According to Ray Boren from Deseret News [...] "is very much a period piece, with an intimate club feel". Another positive review came from Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone, who described the song as Madonna's [...] "breathy emotionality", observing that Madonna did not whisper the line [...] "I always get my man", rather sang it aloud, bringing [...] "conviction to a somewhat generic line". According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, songs including [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] are [...] "typical Sondheim, with agile wordplay and devious chromatic harmonies".|$|E
