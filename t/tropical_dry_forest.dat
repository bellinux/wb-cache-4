5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest,</b> Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Good tiger {{habitats}} in subtropical and temperate upland forests {{include the}} Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) Manas-Namdapha. TCUs in <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest</b> include Hazaribagh National Park, Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Kanha-Indravati corridor, Orissa dry forests, Panna National Park, Melghat Tiger Reserve and Ratapani Tiger Reserve. The TCUs in tropical moist deciduous forest are probably {{some of the}} most productive habitats for tigers and their prey, and include Kaziranga-Meghalaya, Kanha-Pench, Simlipal and Indravati Tiger Reserves. The TCUs in tropical moist evergreen forests represent the less common tiger habitats, being largely limited to the upland areas and wetter parts of the Western Ghats, and include the tiger reserves of Periyar, Kalakad-Mundathurai, Bandipur and Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E
500|$|The {{predominant}} {{habitat of}} Eucteniza is desert and <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest</b> of Mexico and Texas. Specimens {{have been collected}} from elevations as low as [...] above sea level (e.g. the Baja California species E. cabowabo, E. diablo, and E. rosalia), to [...] around [...] (E. relata in northeastern Mexico). Burrows are located on flat ground or slight inclines. In southern Texas, E. relata may burrow in residential lawns, and may be particularly likely to be encountered after rains. Eucteniza spiders are generally difficult {{to find in the}} wild, and are rare in museum collections.|$|E
50|$|There are {{protected}} areas in Tumbes and Piura filled with tropical canelo <b>forests</b> and <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forests</b> such as Caza de Coto and Cerros de Amotape, both extending into southern Ecuador. The areas of eastern Lambayeque also have <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forests,</b> which {{are found in}} the Chaparri and Chongoyape provinces. These forests have the particularity of connecting to the Amazon basin through the Marañon passage (an area where there are also <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forests).</b> Mangrove forests are located in four specific areas from Sechura to Tumbes.|$|R

500|$|Aiphanes {{species are}} palms {{of the forest}} {{understorey}} and subcanopy. The most widely distributed species, A.horrida, occurs both in <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest</b> and in more humid forest types, {{but there is a}} gap in its distribution which coincides with the wettest forests of the upper Amazon Basin. Two other species, A. minima and A.eggersii, are also found in drier environments; A.eggersii is found in areas receiving as little as [...] of precipitation annually. The remaining species are found in montane forests at high elevations or in wet—often very wet—lowland forests, including areas receiving as much as [...] of annual precipitation.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all other}} members of the family Cheirogaleidae, the gray mouse lemur is nocturnal and arboreal. It inhabits lowland <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest,</b> sub-arid thorn scrub, gallery forest, spiny forest, eastern {{littoral}} forest, dry deciduous forests, semi-humid deciduous, moist lowland forest, transitional forest, and secondary forests or degraded forests (including plantations) all ranging up to [...] above sea level. [...] The species is more common in secondary forest than in primary forest, particularly bush and scrub habitat, where it occupies a [...] "fine branch" [...] niche, restricting the vertical range to fine branches, fine terminal supports, lianas and dense foliage. These lemurs are usually seen on branches less than [...] in diameter. The gray mouse lemur tends to prefer lower levels of the forest and the understory, where branches and vegetation are dense.|$|E
500|$|The Sathyamangalam {{forest is}} mostly <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest,</b> {{part of the}} South Deccan Plateau dry {{deciduous}} forests ecoregion. There are five distinct forest types: tropical evergreen (Shola), semi-evergreen, mixed-deciduous, dry deciduous and thorn forests. Evergreen forests are restricted to small patches in a few high altitude hill tops of Sathyamamgalam between [...] and [...] These patches are threatened on account of land use changing to hill agriculture and plantation crops, including fruit. Semi-evergreen forests are found at high altitude. Mixed and dry deciduous forests are located on middle altitude slopes and the thorn forests are usually found in the foot hills and some times, due degradation of dry deciduous forests, at the middle elevations. About 65% of the forest division is under forest cover. Significant areas of mixed shrubland and grasslands support a large population of herbivore ungulates, the preferred prey of tigers.|$|E

2500|$|The western {{coastal area}} of Ecuador borders the Pacific Ocean to the west, {{encompasses}} a broad coastal plain, and then {{rises to the}} foothills of the Andes Mountains to the east. It is estimated that 98% of the native forest of coastal Ecuador has been eliminated in favor of cattle ranching and other agricultural production, including banana, cacao and coffee plantations. The forest fragments that still survive are primarily found along the coastal mountain ranges of Mache-Chindul, Jama-Coaque, and Chongon-Colonche, and include <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest,</b> tropical wet forest, tropical moist evergreen forest, premontane cloud forest, and mangrove forest. Collectively known as the Pacific Equatorial Forest, these forest remnants are considered the most endangered tropical forest in the world, and are part of the Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot. [...] Guayaquil, located on {{the southern part of the}} coast is the biggest city in the country. On the north coast of Ecuador the port of Balao in Esmeraldas is used for oil export and the port of Manta was formerly used by the United States Air Force as a control point for narcotics traffic control until 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project will}} require evicting 467 {{families}} and flooding [...] of prime land in this region. The developer has {{to ensure that}} the project affected people have the same or better quality of life in the new areas where they would be resettled with [...] "all public services, health coverage and education, restoration of economic activity and level income equal or greater than the current conditions". Irrigation facilities shall be provided to the resettled families for 5200 ha with facilities for organic production as a measure for the conversion of soil and natural animal management; reforestation in a new land area acquired by the developer shall cover 11079.6 ha to compensate for the loss of 3034ha due to submergence, which shall also ensure the restoration of <b>tropical</b> <b>dry</b> <b>forest</b> for 5 years; shift the church of San José de Belén and rebuild at the new location; removal all vegetation in the submergence area before reservoir filling to prevent decomposition of vegetation and growth of aquatic macrophytes; create an information base on the archaeological sites coming under submergence with due research; repopulate migratory species of fish in the upstream areas of the river and also establish two limnigraph stations; create suitable dumping areas to dispose excavated material which are not used on the project; establish alternate roads, bridges, water supply works and other infrastructure facilities that would be submerged; and rehabilitate of fauna coming under submergence areas by measures such as chasing, capturing and relocation of the fauna (small, medium and large mammals, serpents and birds) and also establish two veterinary units to treat wounded animals.|$|E
