5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which <b>they</b> <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E

500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1440, in the King's name, an {{invitation}} {{is said to}} have been sent to the young, 16-year-old 6th Earl of Douglas and his little brother, twelve-year-old David, to visit the king at Edinburgh Castle in November 1440. According to legend, <b>they</b> <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> were entertained at the royal table, where James, still a little boy, was charmed by them.

2500|$|Another {{argument}} {{for keeping the}} Elgin Marbles within the UK has been made by J. H.

The Guardian has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon. However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. The sculptures which Elgin did not remove have been taken down and put into the new Acropolis Museum.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bob McKeown on the edition of January 26, 2005, of The Fifth Estate, Coulter came under criticism for her statement, [...] "Canada used to be... one of our most... most loyal friends, and vice versa. I mean, Canada sent troops to Vietnam. Was Vietnam less containable {{and more of a}} threat than Saddam Hussein?" [...] McKeown contradicted her with, [...] "No, actually Canada did not send troops to Vietnam." [...] On the edition of February 18, 2005 of Washington Journal, Coulter justified her statement by referring to the thousands of Canadians who served in the American armed forces during the Vietnam era, either because they volunteered or because they were living in the United States during the war years and got drafted. She said, [...] "The Canadian Government didn't send troops... but... <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> fought with the Americans. So I was wrong. It turns out there were 10,000 Americans who happened to be born in Canada." [...] (There were actually between 5,000 and 20,000 Canadians who fought in Vietnam itself, including approximately 80 who were killed.) John Cloud of Time, writing about the incident a few months later, said, [...] "Canada [...] noncombat troops to Indochina in the 1950s and again to Vietnam in 1972".|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] the Midrash {{told that}} the people {{realized}} that they had spoken against Moses and prostrated themselves before him and beseeched him to pray to God on their behalf. The Midrash taught that then [...] immediately reports, “And Moses prayed,” to demonstrate the meekness of Moses, who {{did not hesitate to}} seek mercy for them, and also to show the power of repentance, for as soon as they said, “We have sinned,” Moses was immediately reconciled to them, for one who {{is in a position to}} forgive should not be cruel by refusing to forgive. In the same strain, [...] reports, “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed” (after Abimelech had wronged Abraham and asked for forgiveness). And similarly, [...] reports, “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends” (after they had slandered him). The Midrash taught that when one person wrongs another but then says, “I have sinned,” the victim is called a sinner if the victim does not forgive the offender. For in [...] Samuel told the Israelites, “As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,” and Samuel told them this after <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> said, “We have sinned,” as [...] indicates when it reports that the people said, “Pray for your servants [...] [...] [...] for we have added to all our sins this evil.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut {{reported}} that scholars generally {{agree that the}} term “Hebrew” ( [...] , Ivri), as in [...] came from {{the name of a}} group called Habiru or Apiru, people who had lost their status in the community from which <b>they</b> <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> who were not necessarily related except by common fate. Plaut wrote that the Habiru were a class of people who lived in the Fertile Crescent during the 19th to 14th centuries B.C.E. who may originally have come from Arabia, became prominent in Mesopotamia, and later spread to Egypt. The Habiru followed distinct occupations, particularly mercenaries and administrators. Although at first they were nomads or seminomads, they later settled. [...] They were usually considered foreigners, maintaining their group identity. The term Habiru referred not so much to an ethnic or linguistic group as to a social or political group. Plaut {{reported that}} the words Habiru and “Hebrew” ( [...] , Ivri) appear to share a common linguistic root. Plaut concluded that Israelites in Egypt likely occupied positions similar to, or because of familial ties were identified with, the Habiru. When non-Israelites repeatedly applied the term to the Israelites, the Israelites themselves began to use the name Habiru, which they pronounced Ivri. Plaut considered it possible that for some time the term Ivri was used only when the Israelites spoke of themselves to outsiders and when outsiders referred to them. Thus [...] calls Abram Ivri vis-a-vis an outsider, and Jonah says, [...] "I am an Ivri,” when asked his identity by non-Israelite sailors in [...] but otherwise Israelites referred to themselves by their tribes (for example, Judah or Ephraim) or by their common ancestor, Israel.|$|E
