5000|$|In 1530 {{the town}} council applied to King Frederick I for a Lutheran pastor {{to be sent}} to Køge. <b>The</b> <b>Franciscans</b> were {{especially}} targeted for expulsion because many Danes objected to the additional donations requested by the [...] "beggar monks" [...] (tiggermunker), as some Danes derisively referred to <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> and other mendicant orders It was apparent that the citizens of Køge wanted <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> out of town, but were unwilling to force them out, at least early on. When they delayed, a date was set by which they should leave <b>the</b> friary. <b>The</b> <b>Franciscans</b> believed that they were tricked into leaving.|$|R

50|$|In the 1650s, Governor Bernardo López de Mendizabal, and his {{subordinate}} Nicolas de Aguilar, {{enacted a}} law to force <b>the</b> settlers and <b>Franciscans</b> to pay Native Americans for their work. He opposed what he {{perceived to be the}} mistreatment of the Indians by <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> and proposed to allow the Indians to preserve and to practice their culture, religion, and customs. <b>The</b> <b>Franciscans</b> protested <b>the</b> law and accused the governor before the Inquisition. Later he was tried in Mexico City. So, <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> indirectly governed <b>the</b> New Mexico province.|$|R
5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks are part of <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of}} the creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks {{can be found}}, while sedimentary rocks of <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Most of the convents of {{the town}} have disappeared; the Dominican convent {{is the only one}} to have {{retained}} much of its original appearance. It was built in the 13th century and still has its church and cloister. <b>The</b> <b>Franciscan</b> convent was completely destroyed, apart from the choir of its church, which now serves as a Protestant church. Sélestat also has an old granary that belonged to the Benedictine priory, and a 16th-century commandery built by the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{borough of}} Reading was served by three parish churches: Reading Minster, St Giles' Church, and St Laurence's Church.

After the friars were {{expelled}} in 1538, the building {{was used as a}} hospital, a poorhouse, and a jail, before being restored as the Church of England parish church of Greyfriars Church in 1863.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, the Benedictine Sisters sold {{part of the}} {{property}} to <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans.</b> <b>The</b> old boundary wall was moved {{at this time to}} make the division.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Franciscans</b> came to Cincinnati in 1844 from Tyrol (Austria) to {{minister}} to German-speaking immigrants.

5|$|There {{were two}} friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary {{was founded in}} the western part of the burgh around 1233. <b>The</b> <b>Franciscan</b> (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh {{sometime}} before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a school that was not purely a song school for the cathedral but was also to be available to provide an education in music and reading for some children of Elgin.|$|E
5|$|Tudur Hen {{has since}} the 18th century been {{historically}} {{credited with the}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, but it has since been discovered that the building pre-dated him. However, since the friary sided with Edward in the two Welsh wars since the original construction, it has been proposed that Tudur was responsible for rebuilding the site around 1293 after it was damaged. He arranged to be interred in the south wall of the site.|$|E
5|$|According to the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims, he {{was buried}} in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote that John, who died as a Franciscan friar, may have been buried in <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> church {{dedicated}} to Saint Francis of Assisi which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi's Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.|$|E
40|$|In the {{introductory}} part the author summarizes almost the eight-century-long presence of <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> in <b>the</b> area of today 2 ̆ 7 s Herzegovina and their pastoral/religious and socio-cultural/charitable work. As early {{as in the}} 13 th century <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> brought from Dubrovnik the first experiences from {{the period of the}} so-called monastery medicine; and they soon erected five monasteries with special rooms for the pharmacy; which were designed for the needs of the brethren and the neighbouring population. Although in the Turkish period they lived and worked in difficult circumstances <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> were helping everybody regardless of faith; a Decision of the Congregation “De propaganda fide” defined the medical treatment of the Catholic and non-Catholic (Muslim and Orthodox) population. Apart from <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> who had been practicing traditional folk treatment; since the 18 th century there have appeared a number of Franciscans with proper medical education acquired at the faculties in Italy; Austria and Hungary. Some of them won recognition as authors of valuable medical books. In medicine and pharmacy <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans</b> have been present in Herzegovina up to date...|$|R

5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> church in Hereford. It {{had been his}} wish, however, to be buried at the family's traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, {{and this is where}} he was finally buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may have been inspired by a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views {{had a profound}} effect on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
5|$|Egan {{advanced}} {{rapidly to}} positions of responsibility in <b>the</b> <b>Franciscan</b> order. He was appointed custos ("guardian") {{of the province}} of Munster in Ireland in March 1787. Later that year, he was also appointed custos of the Pontifical College at Sant’Isidoro a Capo le Case, the home of Irish Franciscans in Rome. Egan remained there until 1790, {{when he returned to}} Ireland and was appointed custos of Ennis. He remained in Ireland until 1787 or 1788, when he may have made a visit to the United States. After several more years as a missionary in Ireland, Egan came (or returned) to the United States in 1802.|$|E
40|$|This book {{examined}} {{the story of}} the ‘discovery of America’ through the prism of the history of <b>the</b> <b>Franciscans,</b> a socio-religious movement with a unique doctrine of voluntary poverty. <b>The</b> <b>Franciscans</b> rapidly developed global dimensions, but their often paradoxical relationships with poverty and power offer an alternate account of global history...|$|R
