40|$|Objective: To explore factors {{influencing}} perceptions and viewpoints on {{the responsibility for}} the presence of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food, on enforcement of laws and regulations that control human exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food, and on the effectiveness of such regulations. Methods: An online survey was completed by 740 individuals from several parts of Spain (median age, 47 years; 67 % were women; 70 % had completed university studies). Results: Over 87 % of respondents said that it was possible that throughout their lives they could have accumulated in their body <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> potentially dangerous to their health. The attribution of the responsibility for <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food to a larger number of social groups was more frequent among respondents who consulted information about the problem more often (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 92), who correctly identified factors that increase the likelihood of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food being harmful to human health (OR: 2. 86), who better knew the health problems that may be caused by such substances (OR: 2. 48), and who recognised more food groups that tend to have concentrations of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> potentially harmful to health (OR: 2. 92) (all p values < 0. 001). Women were 65 % less likely than men to answer that regulations on <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food are effective (p <  0. 001); and so were participants who identified more food groups with potentially toxic concentrations. Conclusions: Among study participants there was a widespread scepticism and distrust towards the enforcement and effectiveness of laws and regulations that in Spain aim to control human exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in food...|$|R

25|$|Contemporary {{preparation}} and {{usage of the}} black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous. Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> was theobromine, an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more theobromine than yaupon.|$|E
25|$|Although lead is {{the least}} {{expensive}} dense (SG=11.34) material available, it is a <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> causing biological damage to wildlife and humans. The Centers for Disease Control has stated that no safe level of lead exposure in children has been determined, and that once lead has been absorbed into the body, its effects cannot be corrected. Even a very small amount of exposure causes a permanent reduction in intelligence, ability to focus attention, and academic ability. Lead can be inhaled or ingested as either a metal powder or powdered corrosion products, however most lead salts have very low solubility in water, and pure lead corrodes very slowly in seawater. Absorption through skin is not likely for metallic lead and inorganic corrosion products.|$|E
25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for <b>Toxic</b> <b>Substance</b> Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm.

500|$|The {{common name}} [...] "honey flower" [...] {{is derived from}} the flowers which produce a clear nectar in large quantities. This was a source of {{nourishment}} for Aborigines and, following European colonisation, explorers, escaped convicts and children were recorded sucking the flowers. Explorer Ludwig Leichhardt wrote that [...] "often when I've been tired and thirsty, I've bitten off the base of a tuft of Lambertia formosa flowers to suck the delightfully sweet honey out of them".

500|$|After {{the damage}} was {{discovered}} on 3 February 1997, legal actions were initiated by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate requiring remedial measures to halt the leakage. At its worst, the rate of leakage into the tunnel was [...] of water per minute. The Rhoca-Gil proprietary sealant process was used to stop the leaks. On investigation, Rhoca-Gil was revealed to contain a <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> called acrylamide, which caused health problems for the tunnel workers. The removal of Rhoca-Gil and its replacement with concrete resulted in additional delays. In addition, an extensive permanent pumping system was installed to restore and maintain lake levels in Østmarka.|$|E
500|$|The main <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> {{found in}} the parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin. It was first {{isolated}} by Heinrich Wieland and his colleagues in 1922 and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later. [...] Meanwhile, other workers succeeded in isolating the same compound and its parent steroid bufotalin from the Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus). By 1986, researchers at the Arizona State University had succeeded in synthesizing the toad venom constituents bufotalin, bufalitoxin and bufotoxin. The chemical formula of bufotoxin is C40H60N4O10. Its physical effects resemble those of digitalis which in small doses increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts and which {{is used in the}} treatment of congestive heart failure. The skin of one toad contains enough toxin to cause serious symptoms or even death in animals and man. Clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, paralysis and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, hyperkalemia, cyanosis and hallucinations. There is no known anti-venom. Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, prevention of absorption and electrocardiography to monitor the condition. Atropine, phenytoin, cholestyramine and lidocaine may prove useful in its management.|$|E
