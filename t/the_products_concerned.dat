40|$|A popular, 1999 Taiwanese novel {{published}} for the Chinese book market {{set off a}} twofold transcultural trend: one in {{real life}} and one in literature. To explore this phenomenon, this paper considers the rising popularity of coffee culture and of “Western” food culture, {{as well as the}} increasingly important role that consumption and brand names play in popular literature on the Chinese mainland. I argue that desire, the power of imagination, and the transcultural qualities of the products in question constitute the crucial links between the two trends. Like other cultural products, such as lifestyle magazines, guidebooks, and movies, literary texts (especially successful ones) not only explain to consumers how to integrate new objects of consumption into their daily lives. They also provide ways of bestowing meaning on new forms of consumption and experience. Cultural products call upon consumers to fulfil their desires through imagination. <b>The</b> <b>products</b> <b>concerned</b> all have a global dimension, but are also firmly rooted in the Chinese reality.

It is found that overall behavior is strongly dependent on the ratio of the viscosities of the two phases. When the viscosity of the dispersed oil phase is lower or comparable to that of the continuous aqueous phase, the latter enters the contact and controls,film formation and friction. However when the dispersed phase has viscosity at least four times larger than the dispersion medium, the former enters the contact and determines its tribological properties. This effect is believed occur because at high viscosity ratios the droplets are nondeformable and are thus forced into the contact inlet region, where collisions occur that result in shear-induced coalescence. Once a pool of viscous fluid is formed, the lower viscosity bulk fluid is unable to displace it because the viscous shear stress is too small, so the pool acts as a reservoir to supply the contact...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{accurately}} understand the factors underlying lapse, surrender and mortality (collectively termed ‘decrements ’ {{for the purposes}} of this paper) rates in life insurance is increasing because of (inter alia) the effect of International Accounting Principles, Solvency II and MCEV reporting. The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of Generalized Linear Models to capture empirical dependencies between risk factors and to understand the best factors to allow for in a correct calibration of lapse risk.

40|$|Increasing {{interest}} is being shown in performance measurement, {{in both the}} academic literature and by practitioners. When implementing innovative products, organisations are facing issues of how to measure and manage the performance of <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>concerned</b> {{and how to do}} so in a worthwhile way. Reviewing existing literature suggests that there has been limited research on the value of performance measurement and management processes and indeed little conceptual distinction has been made between performance measurement and performance management. A conceptual framework is developed, structured around concepts from the existing literature showing two ways of distinguishing performance measurement and performance management. Performance management processes are shown as broader than performance measurement processes and the influences of the processes on performance are also displayed, another way of differentiating between the two concepts. The framework provides a structure for a pattern matching analysis using empirical data. Empirical data collection involved four case studies, each focusing on a medical device being implemented in the UK public healthcare sector. Forty-six semi-structured interviews explored performance measurement and performance management processes in the implementation of the innovative products, as well as exploring the influences of those processes on performance of the innovative products. The findings from the thesis highlight key performance measurement and performance management processes that occur in the implementation of innovative products, finding that the two can best be distinguished by their influence, or lack of influence, on performance. Performance reporting is also highlighted as a key concept. The findings indicate that performance measurement and reporting processes alone cannot be expected to have an influence on performance, however if performance management processes occur too then they can.

40|$|The China - Raw Materials dispute {{recently}} arbitrated by the WTO opposed China as defendant to the US and the EU as claimants, on {{the somewhat}} unusual issue of export restrictions. For the claimants, Chinese export restrictions on various raw materials {{of which the}} country is a major producer create shortages in foreign markets. This scarcity does not prevail in the Chinese market and the price in the foreign markets increases, providing a cost advantage to the Chinese industries using these raw materials. China defends export limitations using Article XX of the GATT 1994 on possible exceptions to the prohibition of quantitative restrictions to conserve natural resources. This paper oers a theoretical analysis of the dispute {{with the help of}} a model of a monopoly extracting a non-renewable resource and selling it on both the domestic and foreign markets using Fischer and Laxminarayan (2004) 's framework. The theoretical results focus on the eects of imposing an export quota on quantities, prices and ecacy, and are used to comment on the claims of the parties and on the ndings of the Panel and Appellate Body. Given the crucial importance of demand elasticities in this theoretical understanding of the con ict, the empirical part of the paper provides estimates of import demand elasticity of the claimants as well as of China { for each product concerned in the case, dened at the HS 6 level. The empirical results show that among <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>concerned</b> in the dispute, two groups can be dierentiated depending on China's export position.

40|$|The {{creation}} of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), in the Uruguay Round, and its entry into force in 1995 marked a new stage {{in the history of}} the multilateral system. It was motivated essentially by the rapid expansion of international services trade within an increasingly open environment in many countries. Given the peculiarities of services trade, including the intangible nature of <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>concerned</b> and the need for direct contact between supplier and user in many cases, the Agreement contains a variety of conceptual innovations, including its extension to modes of supply beyond conventional cross-border trade (consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons) and its coverage, and legitimization, of various types of non-tariff restrictions. In turn, the new concepts needed time to be absorbed by the ministries and agencies involved in services trade. Further, the positive-list, or bottom-up, approach to scheduling trade commitments under the GATS meant that great flexibility was given to Members in selecting the sectors concerned and specifying the levels of access provided under individual modes. Thus, not surprisingly, the schedules that emerged from the Uruguay Round, which still account for the majority of current commitments, contain a variety of unclear or superfluous entries that may cause interpretation problems. Their solution could contribute significantly to the clarity and comparability of access obligations across sectors and WTO Members. The scheduling conventions agreed for the Doha Round thus provide specifically for the possibility of technical refinements that leave the substance of commitments unchanged. However, not only was this possibility used more sparingly to date than might have been expected, but additional flaws would be introduced if some current offers were to enter into effect. The following discussion, with a focus on a particular group of entries (market access via commercial presence), tries to explain the scope for such refinements and develop a clearer picture of the areas where further action might be needed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville, 2007. This {{investigation}} probes {{the perceptions}} of consumers as well as marketers {{with regard to the}} branding of fast moving consumer goods in South African retail chain stores. While much research has been conducted on branding, this investigation will focus {{on the extent to which}} marketers’ perceptions and consumers’ perceptions converge with a view to maximizing the mutual benefits to be derived from marketing strategies within a contemporary South African environment. The extent to which South African marketers’ perceptions and consumers’ perceptions converge to promote brand equity is postulated in the brand equity optimization model. The research commenced with an exhaustive literature survey followed by an empirical survey. The fieldwork for this survey was conducted nationally among the three major retail groups in South Africa and among consumers living in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The findings from the literature survey indicate that both local and international companies have realized the potential of investing resources in brand building activities. These findings have provided evidence to suggest that building brand equity for fast moving consumer goods impacts positively on the sales and the popularity of these products. The findings of the empirical research illustrates that the typical South African consumer has become brand conscious and brand building activities encourage them to purchase these products. The findings from the consumer survey were supported by the investigation conducted among retail chain stores who agreed that building brand equity results in increased sales and the popularity of <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>concerned.</b> Consumers have a preference for manufacturer branded products but house brands are selected primarily because they are cheaper. Manufacturer brands are viewed by consumers as having the most innovative packaging, excellent promotional support and consistently good quality while retail chain stores believe that manufacturer brands lead the way in terms of brand building activities, packaging innovation, promotional support and quality. The results of both surveys illustrate that retail chain stores and consumers share similar viewpoints with regards to the branding, packaging, pricing, promotions and quality attributes of fast moving consumer goods in terms of optimizing brand equity...|$|E
