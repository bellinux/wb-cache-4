The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) focused on the Georgia flag as a major issue and some business leaders in Georgia felt that <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag were causing economic harm to the state. In 1992, Governor Zell Miller announced his intention to get the battle flag element removed, but the state legislature refused to pass any flag-modifying legislation. The matter was dropped after the 1993 legislative session. Many Atlanta residents and some Georgia politicians refused to fly the 1956 flag and flew the pre-1956 flag instead.|$|E
40|$|Researchers in {{consumer}} {{and social psychology}} have developed various theories to account for shifts in <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> targets caused by contextual stimuli. In this previous work, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> a target stimulus is observed as it reacts to <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> contextual stimuli. Attention in the past research has focused entirely on the target. As a result, no one has investigated possible shifts in <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> contextual stimuli. <b>The</b> present research proposes and tests a reciprocity hypothesis to explain {{what happens to the}} contextual stimulus and suggests that not only is <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target shifted by the contextual stimulus, but also <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus is shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. That is, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted away from the target in a contrast condition, but toward the target in an assimilation condition. ^ Two studies with 390 undergraduates examined the hypothesis that, after priming, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. In Study 1, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce a contrast effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target was shifted away from the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted away from the target as well. In Study 2, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce an assimilation effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target was shifted toward the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted toward the target. That was, results in both studies supported the predictions. Thus, after <b>the</b> priming procedure, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target (symmetrical <b>perception</b> shift). ...|$|R

500|$|There is {{a long-standing}} notion that {{epilepsy}} and religion are linked, {{and it has}} been speculated that many religious figures had temporal lobe epilepsy.

500|$|In early {{imperial}} China (the Qin and Han Dynasties), religion {{centered around}} the realms of shen (spirits) and yin (shadow). These realms were considered sacred, and religious figures attempted to contact their inhabitants through elaborate ceremonies in which <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practitioner and audience were blurred {{through the use of}} smoke, incense, and music. Other practices were also employed to further manipulate the practitioner's senses. [...] For example, a chief priest would fast and meditate before he performed a sacrifice. The deprivation of food was thought to make him more susceptible to perceive shen, yin, and other phenomena within the smoke during the ritual. During the Han Dynasty, alleged mediums would fall into trances or perform ritual dances to accomplish supernatural feats. Some of these events were documented in the Shi jing (Canon of Odes), written in the Zhou Dynasty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{opening scene}} of the novel {{describes}} Sophie's perceptions of the small Ohio town. [...] She distrusts small towns and sees the landscape as ominous. [...] The last scene is a transformation of the first; Sophie views the same scenery through her new perspective and experiences it as happy and hopeful. [...] The theme is carried through the novel. [...] Sophie is preoccupied with the fading wallpaper in her kitchen; {{in the beginning of}} the book, she sees them as cherries, which reminds her of the humiliation that followed her first sexual experience. [...] Later in the novel, it is revealed that the images are actually apples. [...] The description of the water tower, likewise, evolves from a penis to lipstick to a breast. [...] With these [...] "shifting visual images", Crusie demonstrates that initial assumptions are often false.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} central doctrines of Hume's philosophy, stated {{in the very first}} lines of the Treatise, is his notion that the mind {{consists}} of its mental perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: impressions and ideas. Hume's Treatise thus opens with the words: 'All <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS." [...] Hume states that [...] "I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction" [...] and commentators have generally taken Hume to mean the distinction between feeling and thinking. Controversially, Hume may regard the difference as in some sense a matter of degree, as he takes [...] "impressions" [...] to be distinguished from ideas, {{on the basis of their}} force, liveliness, and vivacity, or what Henry Allison calls the [...] "FLV criterion" [...] in his book on Hume. Ideas are therefore [...] "faint" [...] impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching the handle of a hot pan is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan. [...] According to Hume, impressions are meant to be the original form of all our ideas, and Don Garret has thus coined the term [...] "the copy principle" [...] to refer to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately all copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.|$|E

A little reflection, however, sufficed to get the better of this weakness, and he made a civil inclination of his head, as much as to tell the stranger, notwithstanding his name and place of residence, that he was welcome. Of course no one but the deacon himself knew of the thoughts that troubled him, and after a very brief delay, the guest proceeded with his explanations of the object of his visit.|$|E
6000|$|... § 59. Thus far, then, we have {{considered}} only those causes {{of force in}} language which depend upon economy of the mental energies: we have now to glance at those which depend upon economy of the mental sensibilities. Questionable though this division may be as a psychological one, it will yet serve roughly to indicate the remaining field of investigation. It will suggest that besides considering {{the extent to which}} any faculty or group of faculties is tasked in receiving a form of words and realizing its contained idea, we have to consider the state in which this faculty or group of faculties is left; and how the reception of subsequent sentences and images will be influenced by that state. Without going at length into so wide a topic as the exercise of faculties and its reactive effects, it will be sufficient here to call to mind that every faculty (when in a state of normal activity) is most capable at the outset; and that the change in its condition, which ends in what we term exhaustion, begins simultaneously with its exercise. This generalization, with which we are all familiar in our bodily experiences, and which our daily language recognizes as true of the mind as a whole, is equally true of each mental power, from the simplest of the senses to the most complex of the sentiments. If we hold a flower to the nose for long, we become insensible to its scent. We say of a very brilliant flash of lightning that it blinds us; which means that our eyes have for a time lost their ability to appreciate light. After eating a quantity of honey, we are apt to think our tea is without sugar. The phrase [...] "a deafening roar," [...] implies that men find a very loud sound temporarily incapacitates them for hearing faint ones. To a hand which has for some time carried a heavy body, small bodies afterwards lifted seem to have lost their weight. Now, the truth at once recognized in these, its extreme manifestations, may be traced throughout. It may be shown that alike in the reflective faculties, in the imagination, in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beautiful, the ludicrous, the sublime, in the sentiments, the instincts, in all the mental powers, however we may classify them-action exhausts; and that in proportion as the action is violent, the subsequent prostration is great.|$|E
