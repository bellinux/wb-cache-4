The family allocated {{a large part}} of <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> to awqaf (religious trusts), which they used to fund the construction and maintenance of various public buildings. Some members of the dynasty were buried in Maqbarat al-Ridwan (Ridwan Family Graveyard) located just south of the Great Mosque of Gaza. As of 2008, the cemetery contained a few marble graves.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went. The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks. The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E

5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} {{in an economic}} revival that had begun {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sovereign wealth {{funds have}} emerged as an {{important}} investor of global equity, attracting growing attention. Despite frequently voiced concerns <b>that</b> sovereign <b>wealth</b> fund investments serve political objectives and conflict with national interests, {{little is known about}} the investment allocation of sovereign wealth funds. We collect new data on over 40, 000 equity investments by sovereign wealth funds and find <b>that</b> sovereign <b>wealth</b> funds tend to invest in countries that share similar cultural traits. This cultural bias indicates <b>that</b> sovereign <b>wealth</b> funds prefer to invest in the familiar. While other global investors display similar aptitude to investing in the familiar, the cultural bias for sovereign wealth fund investment is particularly pronounced. Moreover, share prices of firms respond favorably when sovereign wealth funds acquire stakes. JEL classification codes: G...|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} 1990, {{there was}} an intense debate in the Sejm on the {{takeover}} of the <b>wealth</b> <b>that</b> belonged to the former PUWP.

Supporters of the acquisition argued <b>that</b> the <b>wealth</b> was built on the basis of plunder and the Treasury grant collected by the whole society. Opponents of SdRP claimed <b>that</b> the <b>wealth</b> was created from membership fees; therefore, they demanded wealth inheritance for SdPR which at that time administered the wealth.

25|$|James II tried {{building}} a powerful militarised {{state on the}} mercantilist assumption that the world's wealth was necessarily finite and empires were created by taking land from other states. The East India Company was thus an ideal tool to create a vast new English imperial dominion by warring with the Dutch and the Mogul Empire in India. After 1689 came an alternative understanding of economics, which saw Britain as a commercial rather than an agrarian society. The proponents of this view, most famously Adam Smith in 1776, argued <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> was created by human endeavour and was thus potentially infinite.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} with other female pharaohs, Hatshepsut's reign was much longer and more prosperous.

She re-established international trading relationships lost during a foreign occupation and brought great wealth to Egypt. <b>That</b> <b>wealth</b> enabled Hatshepsut to initiate building projects that raised the calibre of Ancient Egyptian architecture to a standard, comparable to classical architecture, that would not be rivaled by any other culture for a thousand years. She managed to rule for about 20 years. One of the most famous things that she did was build Hatshepsut's temple (see above).|$|E
25|$|Lomborg {{analyzes}} {{three major}} themes: life expectancy, food and hunger, and prosperity, finding that life expectancy and health levels have dramatically improved {{over the past}} centuries, even though several {{regions of the world}} remain threatened, in particular by AIDS. He dismisses Thomas Malthus' theory that increases in the world's population lead to widespread hunger. On the contrary, Lomborg claims that food is widespread, and humanity's daily intake of calories is increasing, and will continue to rise until hunger's eradication, thanks to technological improvements in agriculture. However, Lomborg notes that Africa in particular still produces too little sustenance, an effect he attributes to the continent's dismal economic and political systems. Concerning prosperity, Lomborg argues <b>that</b> <b>wealth,</b> as measured by per capita GDP, should not be the only judging criterion. He points to improvements in education, safety, leisure, and ever more widespread access to consumer goods as signs that prosperity is increasing {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E

25|$|Employment {{trends in}} Bogotá {{indicate}} that rates of unemployment have fallen while {{a growing number}} of citizens are looking for work. This paradox can largely be explained by ongoing urbanization into Bogotá, therefore poverty remains a substantial problem. Jobs have been created in some sectors, and women are gaining more opportunities for employment, but more progress is needed. Overall, poverty since 1970 has decreased; however, data collected and presented in 2006 by UN-HABITAT at the World Urban Forum in Vancouver, Canada reveal that 50% of the population still live in poverty and many of those live in slums. A separate UN-HABITAT report from 2003 describes three types of slums in Bogotá: inner-city, those lying on the perimeter, and squatter settlements. The total number of those living under these conditions is around 700,000. Additional data by UN-HABITAT shows <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> is very unevenly distributed and that pockets of poverty exist in Bogotá that are poorer than the poorest regions of the country as a whole.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} is especially dramatic {{due in large}} part to the massive scale of the country's revenues from oil and other natural resources. The Guardian noted that the nation is enormously wealthy due to vast oil reserves, but that <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> is concentrated in the hands of an elite minority. Despite its GDP per capita of $32,026 – which makes it richer than any other African country and places it above Spain, Portugal, and Russia – Equatorial Guinea is ranked 136th out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index measure of quality of life. While the people of Equatorial Guinea technically have a per capita GDP similar to Spain or Italy, the vast majority live in poverty worse than Afghanistan or Chad, according to Arvind Ganesan of Human Rights Watch in 2009, attributing this disparity to the government's corruption, incompetence, and disregard of its own people's well-being. Most people in Equatorial Guinea remain in abject poverty, with no access to healthcare or education. Meanwhile, any criticism of the ruling class is non-existent due to the government's use of force and intimidation to silence opposition.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly {{with the thought}} of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{argues that}} the world of Thunderbirds {{is similar to the}} 1960s to the extent that {{contemporary}} capitalism and class structures appear to have survived mostly intact. He also observes, however, <b>that</b> <b>wealth</b> and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths. According to Thomas, a contributing factor to the series' lasting popularity is the realism of IR's machines. Newman, for his part, suggests that [...] "the point isn't realism. The 21st century of Thunderbirds is detailed... but also de-populated, a high-tech toyland". He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values, noting the [...] "square, almost 50s" [...] attitudes to race, gender and class. With regard to stereotyping, Hood comments that he [...] "would be happier if [...] didn't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation". Cull, by contrast, considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race, arguing that it rejects negative stereotyping through the use of [...] "positive non-white characters" [...] such as Kyrano and Tin-Tin. However, he deems many of the one-off villains derivative, commenting that these characters are typically presented as [...] "corrupt businessmen, spivs and gangsters familiar from crime films".|$|E
500|$|In post-canonical and vernacular Pāli literature, {{such as the}} Jātaka {{stories of}} the Buddha's {{previous}} lives, the Avadānas and Anisaṃsa texts, {{as well as in}} many Mahāyāna texts, merit is the main concept. It is regarded as something which can be accumulated throughout different lifetimes in the process of attaining Buddhahood, and is also instrumental in attaining it. The Bodhisatta intent on accomplishing Buddhahood and bringing other beings across the ocean of suffering, must do so by accumulating all sorts of merits, in this context also called perfections ( [...] ; [...] ). This form of merit-making is always led by a vow for enlightenment ( [...] ; [...] ), and an intention to enlighten others as well, as well as the transferring of merits to all living beings to that effect. Another aspect of meritorious acts, emphasized more in later literature, is the idea that a single meritorious act done will reap many fruits, as, for example, expressed in the Vimānavatthu. Not only is the quality of people's next rebirth affected by their merits, but also the circumstances in which they are reborn; not only in the next life, but also in adjacent lives after <b>that.</b> <b>Wealth,</b> lifespan, and position are all contingent on merit.|$|E
