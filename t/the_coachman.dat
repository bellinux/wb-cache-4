5|$|Yubaba {{has many}} {{similarities}} to <b>The</b> <b>Coachman</b> from Pinocchio, {{in the sense}} that she transforms humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were transformed into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.|$|E

5|$|The jubilation {{with which}} Greeks had hailed their king at the {{beginning}} of the war was reversed in defeat. For a time, he considered abdication. It was not until the King faced down an assassination attempt on 27 February 1898 with great bravery that his subjects again held their monarch in high esteem. Returning from a trip to the beach at Phaleron in an open carriage, George and his daughter Maria were shot at by two riflemen. The King tried to shield his daughter; both were unhurt though <b>the</b> <b>coachman</b> and a horse were wounded. The gunmen (an Athens clerk called Karditzis and his assistant) fled into the Hymettus hills but they were spotted and arrested. Both were beheaded at Nauplia.|$|E
25|$|In June 1911 the Misses Cochrane-Patrick of Ladyland House {{were driving}} home in their waggonette from the Kerse Mission on a Sunday night; the horse shied at a {{dog on the}} {{roadside}} and fell, overturning the machine at the same time.

500|$|Despite the pleas of the Times for scepticism, {{belief in}} the Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square {{continued}} to spread in 1815.

The crowd tried to stop the carriage, but <b>the</b> <b>coachman</b> drove through the crowd at high speed. It was later claimed that the coach had been seen to stop in Grosvenor Square; it was presumed that the Pig-faced Lady was the daughter of [...] "a well-known lady of fashion" [...] who lived there.|$|E

500|$|Louise, Lorne, and two attendants, {{were hurt}} in a sleigh {{accident}} on 14 February 1880. The winter was particularly severe, and the carriage {{in which they}} were traveling overturned, throwing <b>the</b> <b>coachman</b> and footman from the sleigh. The horses then panicked, and dragged the overturned carriage over more than [...] of ground. Louise was knocked unconscious when she hit her head on the iron bar supporting the roof, and Lorne was trapped underneath her, expecting [...] "the sides of the carriage to give way at any moment". Eventually, as they overtook the sleigh ahead, the horses calmed, and the occupant of that sleigh, Princess Louise's aide-de-camp, ordered an empty carriage to convey the injured party back to Rideau Hall.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the huge}} success of Snow White, Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for Pinocchio, which {{marked the first time}} an {{animated}} film had used celebrities as voice actors. He cast popular singer Cliff Edwards, also known as [...] "Ukelele Ike", as Jiminy Cricket. Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child. He cast 12-year-old child actor Dickie Jones, who had previously been in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He also cast Frankie Darro as Lampwick, Walter Catlett as Foulfellow the Fox, Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy, Charles Judels as both the villainous Stromboli and <b>the</b> <b>Coachman,</b> and Christian Rub as Geppetto, whose design was even a caricature of Rub.|$|E
500|$|Verdi and Strepponi now {{decided on}} marriage; they {{travelled}} to Collonges-sous-Salève, a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859 {{the couple were}} married there, with only <b>the</b> <b>coachman</b> who had driven them there and the church bell-ringer as witnesses. At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis [...] " [...] I have not made any more music, I have not seen any more music, I have not thought anymore about music. I don't even know what colour my last opera is, and I almost don't remember it." [...] He began to remodel Sant'Agata, which took most of 1860 to complete and on which he continued {{to work for the}} next twenty years.

500|$|John Davenport {{returned}} to Bramall in 1876 {{at the age}} of 25, but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold. The furniture was auctioned, while the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate (totalling [...] ) was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited, a Manchester property development firm, on 3 August 1877 for £200,000 (about £ in [...] ). According to speculation, the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building. It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill, a local industrialist whose wealth came from calico printing, for his son, Charles. While living in the house, Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling, making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building's external features. The landscape of the grounds was redesigned, and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge, housing <b>the</b> <b>coachman</b> and head gardener respectively. Another building, known as Hall Cottage, was also built in the vicinity, and housed the Sidebottom family.|$|E
500|$|In 1854, {{he built}} Washington New Hall, {{a few miles}} south of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1872 an {{illegally}} young chimney sweep, aged 7, died in a chimney in the Hall. Bell promptly moved into the newly built Rounton Grange near Northallerton, leaving Washington Hall empty for nineteen years until he donated it as a home for poor children, named at his request [...] "Dame Margaret's Hall". According to his granddaughter's biographer Georgina Howell, he was [...] "a formidable giant of a man" [...] and somewhat abrasive. The family prepared a Christmas alphabet in 1877 at Rounton Grange, including [...] "C is the Crushing Contemptuous Pater", which Bell's daughter Elsa later annotated [...] "Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell". In Howell's view, another event also hinted at Bell's character: one cold winter's night, his coachman was found, according to some papers found in Mount Grace Priory, [...] "frozen stiff on the box-seat of his carriage". Howell notes that <b>the</b> <b>coachman</b> could simply have had a heart attack, and not have died of exposure at all, but still, in her view [...] "consideration for others was not, perhaps, Lowthian's principal quality".|$|E
500|$|Now a Grade II listed building, The Coach House {{stands on}} Clifton Hill. It was built as the coach house of Aberdeen Lodge (now 5 Powis Villas). [...] Statue-maker Joseph Rogers Browne built this house for himself, {{along with the}} {{neighbouring}} villas at numbers 6 and 7. [...] He later wanted accommodation for his carriages, so in 1852 he erected the brick, flint and stucco building with space for two coaches and three horses. [...] There was also a hay loft and a separate room for <b>the</b> <b>coachman,</b> and the exterior had Coade stone decoration. By the 1920s {{it had become a}} garage; in 1937, after this closed, the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital bought it and used it to store their ambulances. [...] Local conservationists set up a limited company, which bought the building in 2006, intending {{to turn it into a}} community centre and museum; but it was repossessed in 2008 and was thereafter used for storage by a clothes shop. In its assessment of the building's architectural importance when granting listed status in 2005, English Heritage described it as a [...] "substantially intact and rare survival" [...] with [...] "polite architectural and sculptural features".|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} before 1897, {{another member of}} the family, the doctor Edward Cave, left Holt Farm and moved to Crewkerne in Somerset, taking the Ooser with him. In 1897, he {{relocated}} to Bath, leaving the Ooser with his family coachman; when Edward Cave subsequently tried to recover the head, he was informed that it had been [...] "disposed of", with some suggestion that it had found its way to the United States. In 1935, a folklore collector named S. A. Ramsden undertook enquiries into the fate of the head at the prompting of the Egyptologist and folklorist Margaret Murray. His enquiries led him to meet with Cave's coachman, Lawrence, who [...] after Cave left Crewkerne [...] had subsequently served as <b>the</b> <b>coachman</b> for Cave's replacement, a doctor by the name of Webber. Lawrence said that Cave left the head in his house in the village, where it was hung up in a loft and began to fall apart; Lawrence recalled wearing it to frighten people during a parade around 1900, at which time the hair was falling out. He said that the house was later pulled down, with the head probably still inside it, in order for a local post office to be constructed in its place.|$|E
