40|$|Abstract—Body Area Networks (BANs) are {{expected}} {{to play a major}} role in patient health monitoring in the near future. Providing an efficient key agreement with the prosperities of plug-n-play and transparency to support secure inter-sensor communi-cations is critical especially during the stages of network initial-ization and reconfiguration. In this paper, we present a novel key agreement scheme termed Ordered-Physiological-Feature-based Key Agreement (OPFKA), which allows two sensors belonging to the same BAN to agree on a symmetric cryptographic key generated from the overlapping physiological signal features, thus avoiding the pre-distribution of keying materials among the sensors embedded in the same human body. The secret features computed from the same physiological signal at different parts of the body by different sensors exhibit some overlap but they are not completely identical. To overcome this challenge, we detail a computationally efficient protocol to securely transfer the secret features of one sensor to another such that two sensors can easily identify the overlapping ones. <b>This</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>possesses</b> many nice features such as the resistance against brute force attacks. Experimental results indicate that OPFKA is secure, efficient, and feasible. Compared with the state-of-the-art PSKA protocol, OPFKA achieves a higher level of security at a lower computational overhead.

40|$|To whom reprint {{requests}} {{should be sent}} The resistant hepatocyte model was used to study expression of tumor-associated aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activi-ty {{during the course of}} rat hepatocarcinogenesis. The hepatic ALDH phenotype was determined at intervals over 280 days by histochemical analysis, total ALDH activity assays and gel electrophoresis, using propionaldehyde and NAD (P/NAD) to characterize normal liver ALDH activity or benzaldehyde and NADP (B/NADP) to determine tumor-associated ALDH activity. By total activity assays and gel electro-phoresis, no significant changes in ALDH activity occurred until day 70. However, histochemical analysis clearly demon-strated changes in ALDH activity early in neoplastic develop-ment. Intense focal hepatocyte staining with P/NAD and/or B/NADP was first detectable at day 28. The number of P/NAD-positive foci increased until day 35 then declined un-til day 70. The number of B/NADP-positive foci also increas-ed until day 35, but then remained relatively constant {{for the remainder of the}} experiment. GGT activity of serial sections indicated that early ALDH-positive lesions represent a small subpopulation (9 %) of all GGT-positive foci. However, by day 168 a significant portion (80 %) of persistent GGT-positive neoplastic nodules were also B/NADP-positive histochemically. In addition, virtually all hepatocellular car-cinomas (96 %) generated by <b>this</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>possessed</b> signifi-cantly elevated levels of tumor-associated ALDH by histo-chemical analysis, total ALDH activity and gel electro-phoresis. These results indicate that early appearing ALDH-positive lesions may define one early subpopulation of all in-itiated cells that have a high probability of progressing to the ultimate neoplasm...|$|R
