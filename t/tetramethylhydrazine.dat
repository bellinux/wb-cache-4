40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of tetrakis(dimethylamido) titanium (TDMAT) follows {{a number of}} competitive reactions, including not only the known hydrogenation and b-hydride elimination steps, to produce dimethylamine and N-methylmethaneimine respec-tively, but also a reductive elimination to yield <b>tetramethylhydrazine</b> and a more complex conversion to N,N,N 0 -trimethyldiamino-methane and N,N,N 0,N 0 -tetramethyldiaminomethane. The latter reactions {{may account for the}} reduction of the metal when these compounds are used for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of metal nitride films. Similar reactions take place with tetrakis (ethyl-methylamido) titanium (TEMAT) and with pentakis(dimethylamido) tantalum (PDMAT) ...|$|E
40|$|Reactions of d(0) amides M(NMe 2) (4) (M = Zr, 1; Hf, 2) with O- 2 {{have been}} found to yield unusual trinuclear oxo aminoxide {{complexes}} M- 3 (NMe 2) (6) (mu-NMe 2) (3) (mu(3) -O) (mu(3) -ONMe 2) (M = Zr, 3; Hf, 4) in high yields. <b>Tetramethylhydrazine</b> Me 2 N-NMe 2 was also observed in the reaction mixtures. Crystal structures of 3 and 4 have been determined. Density functional theory calculations have been performed to explore the mechanistic pathways in the reactions of model complexes Zr(NR 2) (4) (R = H, 5; Me, 1) and [Zr(NR 2) (4) ](2) (R H, 5 a; Me, 1 a) with triplet O- 2. Monomeric and dimeric reaction pathways {{in the formation of the}} Zr complex 3 are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Dissociative {{electron}} attachment (DEA) spectra were recorded for methanol, phenol, diethylamine, <b>tetramethylhydrazine,</b> piperazine, pyrrole and N,N-dimethylaniline. Comparison with He I photoelectron spectra permitted {{the assignment of}} virtually all DEA bands in the saturated compounds to core excited Feshbach resonances with double occupation of Rydberg-like orbitals and various Koopmans' states of the positive ion as a core. These resonances shift to lower energies with alkyl substitution, {{in contrast to the}} shape resonances, and are found at surprisingly low energies in the amines. The DEA spectra in the unsaturated compounds show no or only weak evidence for the Rydberg-type Feshbach resonances. It is proposed that DEA in saturated polyatomic molecules containing hydroxyl and amino groups is in general dominated by this type of resonance...|$|E
40|$|The surface-catalyzed air {{oxidation}} {{reactions of}} hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine, unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, symmetrical dimethylhydrazine, trimethylhydrazine and <b>tetramethylhydrazine</b> were investigated in a metal-powder packed turbular flow reactor at 55 {{plus or minus}} 3 C. Hydrazine was completely reacted on all surfaces studied. The major products of monomethylhydrazine (MMH) oxidation were methanol, methane and methyldiazene. The di-, tri- and tetra-methyl hydrazines were essentially unreactive under these conditions. The relative catalytic reactivities toward MMH are: Fe greater than Al 2 O 3 greater than Ti greater than Zn greater than 316 SS greater than Cr greater than Ni greater than Al greater than 304 L SS. A kinetic scheme and mechanism involving adsorption, oxidative dehydrogenation and reductive elimination reactions on a metal oxide surface are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Second-order rate {{constants}} kij(obsd) {{measured at}} 25 °C in acetonitrile by stopped-flow spectrophotometry for forty-four electron transfer (ET) reactions among fourteen 0 /+ 1 couples [three aromatic compounds (tetrathiafulvalene, tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, and 9, 10 -dimethyl- 9, 10 -dihydrophenazine), four 2, 3 -disubstituted 2, 3 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane derivatives, six acyclic hydrazines, and the bridgehead diamine 1, 5 -diazabicyclo[3. 3. 3]undecane] and seventeen compounds and forty-seven reactions {{from a previous}} study (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 5900) [three p-phenylenediamine derivatives, four ferrocene derivatives, and ten tetraalkylhydrazines] are discussed. When all 91 kij(obsd) values are simultaneously fitted to Marcus's adiabatic cross rate formula kij(calcd) = (kiikjjKijfij) 1 / 2, ln fij = (ln Kij) 2 / 4 ln(kiikjj/Z 2), best-fit self-exchange rate constants, kii(fit), are obtained that allow remarkably accurate calculation of kij(obsd); kij(obsd) /kij(calcd) is in the range 0. 5 − 2. 0 for all 91 reactions. The average difference without regard to sign, |ΔΔGij|, between observed cross reaction activation free energy and that calculated using the kii(fit) values and equilibrium constants is 0. 13 kcal/mol. The ΔGii(fit) values obtained range from 2. 3 kcal/mol for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene 0 /+ to 21. 8 kcal/mol for tetra-n-propylhydrazine 0 /+, corresponding to a factor of 2 × 1014 in kii(fit). The principal factor affecting kii(fit) for our data {{appears to be the}} internal vertical reorganization energy (λv), but kii(fit) values also incorportate the effects of changes in the electronic matrix coupling element (V). Significantly smaller V values for ferrocenes and for hydrazines with alkyl groups larger than methyl than for aromatics and <b>tetramethylhydrazine</b> are implied by the observed ΔGii(fit) values...|$|E
40|$|The {{unimolecular}} dissociation {{reactions of}} ionized methylhydrazine, CH 3 NHNH 2 +·, 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine, (CH 3) 2 NNH 2 +·, and <b>tetramethylhydrazine,</b> (CH 3) 2 NN(CH 3) 2 +·, were investigated using tandem mass spectrometry, threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy and variational transition state theory. The modelled thresholds for the ion dissociation yielded new thermochemistry for these N 2 -containing ions. The low energy dissociation pathways of the methyl-substituted hydrazine radical cations {{correspond to the}} losses of a hydrogen atom, a methyl radical and/or a rearrangement process leading {{to the loss of}} methane. The three fragment ions of MH+· are ion m/z 45, CH 2 NHNH 2 +, ion m/z 31, NHNH 2 +, and ion m/z 30, N 2 H 2 +·. The two fragment ions of DMH+· are ion m/z 59, (CH 3) (CH 2) NNH 2 +, and ion m/z 45, CH 3 N=NH 2 +. The two fragment ions of TMH +· are ion m/z 73, (CH 3) 2 NNCH 3 +, and ion m/z 72, C 3 H 8 N 2 +·. Product ion structures were determined from MIKE, CID, KER and deuterium exchange experiments performed on a modified VG ZAB mass spectrometer of BEE geometry. The TPEPICO experiments were performed at the Daresbury Laboratory Synchrotron Radiation Source. The breakdown diagrams in the threshold region for each ion were modelled. The potential energy curve of each dissociation reaction was calculated at the B 3 -LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d) level of theory. The molecular configuration corresponding to the minimum sum-of-states was located and used as the transition state in the RRKM calculation of k(E). The k(E) data was convoluted with the internal energy distribution of the ion, the electron transmission function of the electron analyser and the monochromator band-pass width to simulate the experimental breakdown curves. The effects of the entropy of activation on simple dissociation reactions were also investigated. Several transition states were identified with increasing ion internal energy for the methyl radical loss and the hydrogen atom loss channels. The variation in the DeltaS‡ values was found to affect largely the shape of the breakdown curves and the dissociation reactions. Enthalpies of formation of the fragment ions, determined from the theoretical fits of the experimental breakdown curves, were found to be in excellent agreement with the calculated values. The proton affinities of several NN-containing neutral molecules and the N [...] C and H [...] C bond dissociation enthalpies were also determined...|$|E
