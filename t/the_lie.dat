5|$|Due to this {{it often}} suffices to find {{representations}} of <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra. Lie algebras are much simpler objects than Lie groups to work with. Due {{to the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra is a finite-dimensional vector space, {{in the case of the}} Lorentz Lie algebra the dimension is , one need only find a finite number of representative matrices of <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra, one for each element of a basis of <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra as a vector space. The rest follow from extension by linearity, and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, Apollonius' {{problem can}} be re-stated in Lie {{geometry}} as a problem of finding perpendicular vectors on <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> quadric; specifically, {{the goal is to}} identify solution vectors Xsol that belong to <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> quadric and are also orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vectors X1, X2 and X3 corresponding to the given circles.|$|E

5|$|The Lorentz {{group is}} a Lie group and has as such a Lie algebra, <b>The</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E

5|$|Again, it is {{required}} that the set of infinite matrices obtained this way stand in one-to-one correspondence with the original -matrices and that the multiplication table is the right one – {{the one of the}} -matrices. It should be emphasized that in the infinite-dimensional case, the concern is rarely the complete matrices. They are exposed here only to highlight the common thread.

5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since <b>the</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E

5|$|The {{part-time}} portion at {{the former}} Horace Harding Boulevard on the east end has a closed and removed booth and one street stair to {{the north side of}} Queens Boulevard at 92nd Street. This entrance abuts two expressway ramps and leads to the former Horace Harding Boulevard, now replaced by <b>the</b> <b>LIE</b> exit ramp. This exit still has a directional mosaic pointing to it, listing the exit as 60th Avenue and 92nd Street {{on the north side of}} Queens Boulevard. The construction of the Long Island Expressway removed this intersection. This is also a staircase that dates to the station's opening.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{extensions}} and realignment of the Canarsie Line were cancelled in 1973, due {{to community}} opposition against the proposed expressways {{that the line}} would have been built along with. Later that year, <b>the</b> <b>LIE</b> line was canceled because New York state voters had declined a $3.5 billion bond measure that would have paid for five subway extensions, including <b>the</b> <b>LIE</b> line. This {{was the second time}} that voters declined a bond issue to finance this extension, with the first being on November 2, 1971 for $2.5 billion. The defeat set back the construction of subway construction projects, including the Lower East Side Loop, the Utica Avenue Line, the Nostrand Avenue extension, the Jamaica Avenue Line, and the Northeast Queens Line. The 1973 bond issue, in addition to financing <b>the</b> <b>LIE</b> line would have also paid for an extension of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line to Co-op City, an extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Hillside Avenue and Springfield Boulevard, a joint LIRR/subway extension from the Atlantic Avenue LIRR terminal to Lower Manhattan, and a branch of the Queens Boulevard Line at 63rd Drive to the Rockaways via the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch. The double fare to the Rockaways would have been removed, and while this was not done as part of the bond issue, it was removed on September 1, 1975. However, the MTA believed that many other projects would still be built. By November 1974, the MTA projected a 1981 opening date for the Archer Avenue Line to Springfield Boulevard, as well as a 1982 opening date for the 63rd Street Line and for the SAS from 34th Street to 125th Street. In 1983, the Queens Super Express Bypass was to open, and in the same year, the Bronx extension of the SAS and the BMT Jamaica Line reroute to Archer Avenue would open. The MTA thought that the SAS's southern extension to Whitehall Street would open by 1988, and that by 1993, the Utica Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, and LIE subway lines and the LIRR East Side Access would all open.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and {{the largest and most}} drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established {{in the southern part of}} Belton park. <b>The</b> <b>lie</b> of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and the East Coast main line railway station at Grantham. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama.

Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
