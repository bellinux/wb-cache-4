5|$|Prior to the {{ratification}} {{and implementation of}} the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation was too weak to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E
5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government would be established.

5|$|As the war {{had ended}} with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined.

5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory.

5|$|In September 1786, at the Annapolis Convention, {{delegates from}} five states {{called for a}} Constitutional Convention {{in order to discuss}} {{possible}} improvements to <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation. The Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787. Rhode Island, fearing that the Convention would work to its disadvantage, boycotted the Convention and, when the Constitution was put to the states, initially refused to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|On the 17th, {{members of}} the twelve {{delegations}} then present in Philadelphia signed the constitution, except for the three men who had stated they would not.

5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed that}} the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E

5|$|A new U.S. federal {{government}} began operating in 1789, following the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution. The previous central government under <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E

5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command. All but two or three had served in colonial or state government during their careers. The vast majority (about 75%) of the delegates were or had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during the Revolution. Several had been state governors. Just two delegates, Roger Sherman and Robert Morris, would be signatories {{to all three of}} the nation's founding documents: the Declaration of Independence, <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> <b>of</b> Confederation, and the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
