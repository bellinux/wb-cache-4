5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the <b>turgor</b> pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin <b>turgor,</b> and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining <b>turgor</b> pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain <b>turgor.</b>|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the <b>turgor</b> pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular <b>turgor</b> by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} now {{thought to have}} evolved from an Agaricus ancestor, and adapted for {{survival}} in dry habitats. These adaptations include: a cap that does not expand (thus conserving moisture); dark-colored gills that do not forcibly eject spores (a mechanism known to depend on <b>turgor</b> pressure achievable only in sufficiently hydrated environments); and a partial veil that remains on the fruit body long after it has matured. This form of growth is called secotioid development, and is typical of other desert-dwelling fungi like Battarrea phalloides, Podaxis pistillaris, and Montagnea arenaria. Molecular analysis based on the sequences of the partial large subunit of ribosomal DNA and of the internal transcribed spacers shows that A.deserticola {{is closely related to}} but distinct from A.aridicola. A separate analysis showed A.deserticola to be closely related to A.arvensis and A.abruptibulbus.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell <b>turgor</b> pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
25|$|Opening and {{closure of}} the stomatal pore is {{mediated}} by changes in the <b>turgor</b> pressure of the two guard cells.The <b>turgor</b> pressure of guard cells is controlled by movements of large quantities of ions and sugars {{into and out of}} the guard cells. When guard cells take up these solutes, the water potential (Ψ) inside the cells decreases (creating a hypotonic solution), causing osmotic water flow into the guard cells. This leads to a <b>turgor</b> pressure increase causing swelling of the guard cells and the stomatal pores open. The ions that are taken up by guard cells are mainly potassium (K+) ions and chloride (Cl−) ions. In addition guard cells take up sugars that also contribute to opening of the stomatal pores.|$|E
25|$|The active glue traps use rapid plant {{movements}} to trap their prey. Rapid plant movement {{can result from}} actual growth, or from rapid changes in cell <b>turgor,</b> which allow cells to expand or contract by quickly altering their water content. Slow-moving flypapers like Pinguicula exploit growth, while the Venus flytrap uses such rapid <b>turgor</b> changes which make glue unnecessary. The stalked glands that once made glue became teeth and trigger hairs in Drosera —an example of natural selection hijacking preexisting structures for new functions.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a proton pump drives protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the water potential inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and <b>turgor</b> pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra <b>turgor</b> pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of the soil has been {{affected}} by over salinity and it has been known to limit the growth of many plants. Globally, the total area of saline soil was 397,000,000 ha and in continents like Africa, it makes up 2 percent of the soil. The amount of soil salinization has reached 19.5% of the irrigated land and 2.1% of the dry-land agriculture around the world. Soil salinization affects the plants using osmotic potential by net solute accumulation. The osmotic pressure in the plant is what maintains water uptake and cell <b>turgor</b> to help with stomatal function and other cellular mechanisms. Over generations, many plant genes have adapted, allowing plants’ phenotypes to change and built different mechanisms to counter salinity effects.|$|E
500|$|Children {{infected}} with rotavirus usually {{make a full}} recovery within three to eight days. However, in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common. [...] Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea, and {{a child with a}} significant degree of dehydration may have a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin <b>turgor,</b> and abnormal breathing. Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation, and malnutrition, stunted growth, and long-term cognitive delays can result.|$|E
500|$|On {{physical}} examination {{there is usually}} clinical evidence of dehydration, such as a dry mouth and decreased skin <b>turgor.</b> If the dehydration is profound enough to cause {{a decrease in the}} circulating blood volume, tachycardia (a fast heart rate) and low blood pressure may be observed. Often, a [...] "ketotic" [...] odor is present, which is often described as [...] "fruity", often compared to the smell of pear drops whose scent is a ketone. If Kussmaul respiration is present, this is reflected in an increased respiratory rate.|$|E
500|$|In C4 plants, sodium is a {{micronutrient}} {{that aids}} metabolism, specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll. In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining <b>turgor</b> pressure and aiding {{in the opening}} and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit [...] the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential, which may result in plant wilting; excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis. In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves; excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth. Halophytes have adapted {{to be able to}} flourish in sodium rich environments.|$|E
500|$|The column {{typical of}} the genus Stylidium is {{sensitive}} and responds to touch. The change in pressure when a pollinating insect lands on a Stylidium flower causes a physiological change in the column <b>turgor</b> pressure by way of an action potential, sending the column quickly flying toward the insect. Upon impact, the insect will be covered in pollen and stunned, but not harmed. Because the column comprises the fused male and female reproductive organs of the flower, the stamen and stigma take turns in dominating {{the function of the}} columnthe anthers develop first and then are pushed aside by the developing stigma. This delayed development of the stigma prevents self-pollination and ensures that cross pollination will occur between individuals of a population. Different species have evolved the trigger mechanism in different locations, with some attacking the pollinating insect from above and others from below (a [...] "punch in the gut" [...] to the insect).|$|E
2500|$|In most cells, {{the cell}} wall is flexible, {{meaning that it}} will bend rather than holding a fixed shape, but has {{considerable}} tensile strength. The apparent rigidity of primary plant tissues is enabled by cell walls, but is not due to the walls' stiffness. Hydraulic <b>turgor</b> pressure creates this rigidity, along with the wall structure. The flexibility of the cell walls is seen when plants wilt, so that the stems and leaves begin to droop, or in seaweeds that bend in water currents. As John Howland explains: ...|$|E
2500|$|When mature apothecia become {{filled with}} water, the asci absorb {{some of that}} water and develop a <b>Turgor</b> pressure, a {{hydrostatic}} pressure within the ascus which {{put pressure on the}} tip of the ascus, held in place by [...] the rigid ascus wall. As the water level in the cup reduces due to evaporation, the asci tips dry out, resulting in a negative vapor pressure that ultimately results in the thin tissue at the wall of the apex (the operculum) breaking outward, releasing the spores.|$|E
2500|$|Nastic {{movements}} {{results from}} differential cell growth (e.g. epinasty and hiponasty), or from changes in <b>turgor</b> pressure within plant tissues (e.g., nyctinasty), which may occur rapidly. [...] A familiar example is thigmonasty (response to touch) in the Venus fly trap, a carnivorous plant. [...] The traps consist of modified leaf blades which bear sensitive trigger hairs. When the hairs are {{touched by an}} insect or other animal, the leaf folds shut. [...] This mechanism allows the plant to trap and digest small insects for additional nutrients. [...] Although the trap is rapidly shut by changes in internal cell pressures, the leaf must grow slowly to reset for a second opportunity to trap insects.|$|E
2500|$|Guard {{cells are}} {{specialized}} {{cells in the}} epidermis of leaves, stems and other organs {{that are used to}} control gas exchange. They are produced in pairs with a gap between them that forms a stomatal pore. The stomatal pores are largest when water is freely available and the guard cells turgid, and closed when water availability is critically low and the guard cells become flaccid. Photosynthesis depends on the diffusion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air through the stomata into the mesophyll tissues. Oxygen (O2), produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis, exits the plant via the stomata. [...] When the stomata are open, water is lost by evaporation and must be replaced via the transpiration stream, with water taken up by the roots. Plants must balance the amount of CO2 absorbed from the air with the water loss through the stomatal pores, and this is achieved by both active and passive control of guard cell <b>turgor</b> and stomatal pore size.|$|E
2500|$|The cell {{envelope}} {{is composed}} of the plasma membrane and cell wall. As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall {{is to protect the}} cell from internal <b>turgor</b> pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is made up of a polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating N-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) residues in equal amounts. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. extracellular parasites such as Mycoplasma) contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. Since the cell wall is required for bacterial survival, but is absent in some eukaryotes, several antibiotics (notably the penicillins and cephalosporins) stop bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis, while having no effects on human cells which have no cell wall only a cell membrane. There are two main types of bacterial cell walls, those of gram-positive bacteria and those of gram-negative bacteria, which are differentiated by their Gram staining characteristics. [...] For both these types of bacteria, particles of approximately 2nm can pass through the peptidoglycan. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast while if it's partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics such as penicillin inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turgor</b> {{pressure}} within {{cells is}} regulated by osmosis and also causes the cell wall to expand during growth. Along with size, rigidity {{of the cell}} is also caused by <b>turgor</b> pressure; a lower pressure results in a wilted cell or plant structure (i.e. leaf, stalk). One mechanism in plants that regulate <b>turgor</b> pressure is its semipermeable membrane, which only allows some solutes to travel {{in and out of}} the cell, which can also maintain a minimum amount of pressure. Other mechanisms include transpiration, which results in water loss and decreases turgidity in cells. <b>Turgor</b> pressure is also a large factor for nutrient transport throughout the plant. Cells of the same organism can have differing <b>turgor</b> pressures throughout the organism's structure. In higher plants, <b>turgor</b> pressure is responsible for apical growth of things such as root tips and pollen tubes.|$|E
50|$|A {{plant cell}} in {{hypotonic}} solution will absorb water by endosmosis, {{so that the}} increased volume {{of water in the}} cell will increase pressure, making the protoplasm push against the cell wall, a condition known as <b>turgor.</b> <b>Turgor</b> makes plant cells push against each other in the same way and is the main line method of support in non-woody plant tissue. Plant cell walls resist further water entry after a certain point, known as full <b>turgor,</b> which stops plant cells from bursting as animal cells do in the same conditions. This is also the reason that plants stand upright. Without the stiffness of the plant cells the plant would fall under its own weight. <b>Turgor</b> pressure allows plants to stay firm and erect, and plants without <b>turgor</b> pressure (known as flaccid) wilt. A cell begins to decline in <b>turgor</b> pressure only when there is no air spaces surrounding it and eventually leads to a greater osmotic pressure than that of the cell. Vacuoles play a role in <b>turgor</b> pressure when water leaves the cell due to hyperosmotic solutions containing solutes such as mannitol, sorbitol, and sucrose.|$|E
50|$|Gas-vaculate {{cyanobacterium}} are {{the ones}} generally responsible for water-blooms. They {{have the ability to}} float due to the accumulation of gases within their vacuole, and the role of <b>turgor</b> pressure and its effect on the capacity of these vacuoles has been observed in varying scientific papers. It is noted that the higher the <b>turgor</b> pressure, the lower the capacity of the gas-vacuoles in different cyanobacterium. Experiments used to correlate osmosis and <b>turgor</b> pressure in prokaryotes have been used to show how diffusion of solutes into the cell have a play on <b>turgor</b> pressure within the cell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turgor</b> pressure's {{actions on}} {{extensible}} cell walls is usually {{said to be}} the driving force of growth within the cell. An increase of <b>turgor</b> pressure causes expansion of cells and extension of apical cells, pollen tubes, and in other plant structures such as root tips. Cell expansion and an increase in <b>turgor</b> pressure is due to inward diffusion of water into the cell, and <b>turgor</b> pressure increases due to the increasing volume of vacuolar sap. A growing root cell's <b>turgor</b> pressure can be up to 0.6 MPa, which is over three times that of a car tire. Epidermal cells in a leaf can have pressures ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 MPa. Seeing that plants can operate at such high pressures, it can explain why trees can grow through asphalt and other hard surfaces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turgor</b> {{pressure}} {{within the}} stomata regulates when the stomata can open and close, {{which has a}} play in transpiration rates of the plant. This is also important because this function regulates water loss within the plant. Lower <b>turgor</b> pressure can mean that the cell has a low water concentration and closing the stomata would help to preserve water. High <b>turgor</b> pressure keeps the stomata open for gas exchanges necessary for photosynthesis.|$|E
5000|$|In fruits such as Impatiens parviflora, Oxalia acetosella and Ecballium elaterium, <b>turgor</b> {{pressure}} is the {{method by which}} seeds are dispersed. In Ecballium elaterium, or squirting cucumber, <b>turgor</b> pressure builds up in the fruit {{to the point that}} aggressively detaches from the stalk, and seeds and water are squirted everywhere as the fruit falls to the ground. <b>Turgor</b> pressure within the fruit ranges from [...]003 to 1.0 MPa.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{concluded}} that loss of <b>turgor</b> pressure within {{the leaves of}} Mimosa pudica {{is responsible for the}} reaction the plant has when touched. Other factors such as changes in osmotic pressure, protoplasmic contraction and increase in cellular permeability have been observed to affect this response. It has also been recorded that <b>turgor</b> pressure is different in the upper and lower pulvinar cells of the plant, and the movement of potassium and calcium ions throughout the cells cause the increase in <b>turgor</b> pressure. When touched, the pulvinus is activated and exudes contractile proteins, which in turn increases <b>turgor</b> pressure and closes the leaves of the plant.|$|E
50|$|In fungi, tugor {{pressure}} {{has been observed}} as a large factor in substrate penetration. In species such as Saprolegnia ferax, Magnaporthe grisea and Aspergillus oryzae, immense <b>turgor</b> pressures have been observed in their hyphae. The study showed that they could penetrate substances like plant cells, and synthetic materials such as polyvinyl chloride. In observations of this phenomenon, {{it is noted that}} invasive hyphal growth is due to <b>turgor</b> pressure, along with the coenzymes secreted by the fungi to invade said substrates. Hyphal growth is directed related to <b>turgor</b> pressure, and growth slows as <b>turgor</b> pressure decreases. In Magnaporthe grisea, pressures of up to 8 MPa have been observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turgor</b> {{pressure}} {{also plays}} a key role in plant cell growth where the cell wall undergoes irreversible expansion due to the force of <b>turgor</b> pressure as well as structural changes in the cell wall that alter its extensibility.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{recorded}} that the petals of Gentiana kochiana and Kalanchoe blossfeldiana bloom via volatile <b>turgor</b> pressure of cells on the plant's adaxial surface. During processes like anther dehiscence, {{it has been observed}} that drying endothecium cells cause an outward bending force which led to the release of pollen. This means that lower <b>turgor</b> pressures are observed in these structures {{due to the fact that}} they are dehydrated. Pollen tubes are cells which elongate when pollen lands on the stigma, at the carpal tip. These cells grow rather quickly due to increases <b>turgor</b> pressure. These cells undergo tip growth. The pollen tube of lilies can have a <b>turgor</b> pressure of 0-21 MPa when growing during this process.|$|E

In outplanted trees, maximum stomatal conductances (g) were {{initially}} low (<0.01 cm/s), and initial base xylem pressure potentials (PSIb) were -2.0 MPa. During the growing season, g increased to about 0.20 cm/s and PSIb to -1.0 MPa. Minimum xylem pressure potential (PSIm) was initially -2.5 MPa, increasing to -2.0 MPa on day 40, and about -1.6 MPa by day 110.

Diurnal <b>turgor</b> (Td), the integral of <b>turgor</b> over the range of RWC between PSIb and PSIm, as a percentage of TA was higher in field-planted white spruce than jack pine until the end of the season.|$|E
50|$|Turgidity is {{the point}} at which the cell's {{membrane}} pushes against the cell wall, which is when <b>turgor</b> pressure is high. When the cell membrane has low <b>turgor</b> pressure then it is flaccid. In plants, this is shown as wilted anatomical structures.
