These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled excessively.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in <b>their</b> <b>lessons,</b> few stayed in the job {{for more than a few}} months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E

The student canceled the contract after using 386 points, Nova offered a refund based on a calculation that 300 points were bought, resulting in a price of 1,750 yen per lesson. Nova said the value of the used points should be calculated as having been bought in smaller lots.|$|E

Alongside nurseries, there are day-care nurses (called Tagesmutter, plural Tagesmütter – the formal, gender-neutral form is Tagespflegeperson(en)) working independently from any pre-school institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children typically up to three years of age.

25|$|Thomas Sprat {{wrote his}} History of the Royal Society in 1667 and set forth, {{in a single}} document, the goals of {{empirical}} science ever after. He expressed grave suspicions of adjectives, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations that are as comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like scholasticism. For Sprat, as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear <b>their</b> <b>lessons.</b> Similarly, he emphasised the need for conciseness in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.|$|E

However, Ah Jie starts to show his jealous side when Kai Qi resolves her misunderstanding with her estranged college buddy Cheng Hao Wei. He soon realizes that his feelings for Kai Qi has turned from friendship to love. With his one month in Taiwan almost up and sensing Hao Wei actively pursuing Kai Qi, he is torn between telling her how he feels or just leaving Taiwan quietly. Living abroad all these years has also made Ah Jie adjust to life being alone, {{but for the first time}} in his life he has formed a bond with someone outside of his family and don't want to lose that feeling. Knowing he can't stay in Taiwan and can't take Kai Qi with him, also not wanting her to end up with Hao Wei, he decides to confess his feelings for her hoping to leave with a lasting memory.|$|E

Opposing this, Greg Jenner, historical consultant to [...] Horrible Histories, has stated that while her medical achievements have been exaggerated, removing Seacole from the curriculum would be a mistake. While Peter Hitchens has argued that Seacole's accomplishments have been exaggerated because anybody who put a contrary view was afraid to be accused of racism, both Jenner and Hugh Muir have asserted that this is not the case. Susan Sheridan has argued that the leaked proposal to remove Seacole from the National Curriculum is part of [...] "a concentration solely on large-scale political and military history and a fundamental shift away from social history."

500|$|The Coonleys {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. in 1916, and while Queene {{continued}} to devote {{her time and}} money, she left the day-to-day direction of the school to Morse. Under her direction, the Junior Elementary School built upon the educational foundations established at the Cottage School, with its focus on the active participation of the students. Drama, music, and dance were important parts of the curriculum, and nature study remained an integral component of students' activities. These ideas, and nature study in particular, were largely the creation of Colonel Francis Wayland Parker, whom John Dewey once referred to as [...] "the father of progressive education". The Junior Elementary School was a proving ground for these principles, which called for {{a new way of}} relating to students, allowing them to freely experience <b>their</b> <b>lessons</b> on their own terms. No distinction was made between boys' and girls' activities, which included gardening, carpentry, and cooking. Coonley recalled that [...] "e had boys and girls. We made no distinction, boys and girls cooked, boys and girls did carpenter work, boys and girls took an equal part in all matters of government." [...] Students re-enacted history and literature, composed their own music, and spent much of their time outdoors. In 1924, Coonley and Morse helped found a journal entitled Progressive Education, in which they published their own practical experiences at the school, accompanied by articles written by leading educational theorists, including John Dewey. It became the leading professional journal of the progressive education movement and was published until 1957.|$|E
