5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 {{due to the}} assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant in the United States was built at the falls on Upton Island. The Brush Electric Company, headed by Charles F. Brush, supplied the equipment, which included five generators. The electricity was transmitted via four circuits to shops on Washington Avenue. The power plant turned on <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> September 5, 1882, {{just ahead of the}} Vulcan Street Plant in Appleton, Wisconsin, which started generating electricity on September 30. The company competed with the Minneapolis Gas Light Company, which later became Minnegasco and is now part of CenterPoint Energy.|$|E

5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to Corkscrew. Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> the stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights {{to the base of}} Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E
5|$|Ground for Three Rivers Stadium {{was broken}} on April 25, 1968. Due to the Steelers' suggestions, the stadium's design {{was changed to}} enclose centerfield. Construction continued, though it became plagued with {{problems}} such as thieves stealing materials from the building site. In November 1969, Arthur Gratz asked the city for an additional $3million ($ million today), which was granted. In January 1970, the opening target date of the stadium was set for May 29; however, because of a failure to install <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> schedule, opening day was pushed back to July 16. The stadium was named in February 1969 for to its location at {{the confluence of the}} Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which forms the Ohio River. It would sometimes be called The House That Clemente Built after Pirates' right-fielder Roberto Clemente.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> the John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon. Green {{means that there is}} at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E

Through <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>On</b> to turn on the headlights for motorcycles during the day, is expected {{to reduce the number of}} traffic accidents, especially in the Semarang City. The purpose of the study to describe and analyze the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>On</b> program (turn on the headlights for motorcycles during the day) in the city of Semarang. In answer to the problem and the purpose of this study, used the theory of George C. Edwarsds III combined with the theory of Donald S. Van Metter and Carl E. Van Horn in analyzing the factors that affect the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>On</b> program by using descriptive qualitative research methods to describe the actual implementation. In data collection, use the way through interviews, documentation, and observations relating to the title taken. The informants were selected include : Kasatlantas Polrestabes Semarang, Kanit Laka Satlantas Polrestabes Semarang, Kanit Dikyasa Satlantas Polrestabes of Semarang City, and 28 students of Diponegoro University who use motorcycle in Semarang City. The results showed that the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>On</b> is not optimal. There are many findings that actual discrepancy is not in accordance with what the goals of <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Programme. It is recommended that a large commitment of each implementer to support <b>the</b> implementation of <b>Light</b> <b>On</b> program in Semarang City both in the budget provision and awareness in <b>the</b> applicationof <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>On</b> program on field. It takes good communication coordination in order to support the success of <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>On</b> program...|$|R

5|$|The {{identity}} of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at Tate, speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for Little John in Daniel Maclise's 1839 Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest. The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates {{that this is not}} simply for dramatic effect, but reflects the fact that after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in Trafalgar Square the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by gaslight, which when crowded with students and with <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> could become extremely hot.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

For example, {{on at least}} two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery. The colors of <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day. The clock tower also plays music.|$|E
25|$|Luminous {{efficacy}} is {{the measure}} of how much light is produced versus how much energy is consumed. HID burners give higher efficacy than halogen lamps. The highest-intensity halogen lamps, H9 and HIR1, produce 2100 to 2530 lumens from approximately 70 watts at 13.2 volts. A D2S HID burner produces 3200 lumens from approximately 42 watts during stable operation. The reduced power consumption means less fuel consumption, with resultant less CO2 emission per vehicle fitted with HID lighting (1.3 g/km assuming that 30% of engine running time is with <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on).</b>|$|E
