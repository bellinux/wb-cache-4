To quantify the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and impact of fishing gears on fish abundance, a survey was carried out in an oxbow lake in eastern India. Methods: The gear-wise CPUE for fish caught in per unit hour of operation was calculated by dividing <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>sampling</b> gear catch in biomass, which is the observed value of fish caught by a particular gear, by <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>sampling</b> effort hours.

40|$|Background and Aim: Foodstuffs {{additives}} are {{a general}} term for {{materials that are}} added to the foodstuffs in order to increase durability and to improve the appearance, composition, taste and food nutritional value. Colors are classified in this group and are added to foodstuffs in order to increase their attraction. The aim of this survey was to analyze status of added colors to the juice of black cherry and juice of barberry which are produced in Tehran City, capital of Iran. Materials and Methods: Three haundred thirty six samples of dried sweets were randomly collected and analyzed from different areas of Tehran. First, the samples were de-colored by Clorhidric Acid, and then were analyzed after refining by Thin Layer Chromatography (T. L. C) method. Results: Eighty nine percent from <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>samples</b> contained colors. Among chromatic samples, 62 samples (18. 5 %) out <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>samples,</b> contained artificial, non-edible colors and 237 samples (70. 5 %) from <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>samples</b> contained artificial and edible colors (for Industrial Producers) and 37 samples (11 %), contained natural colors. Carmoisine color was detected more than added colors in juice of black cherry and juice of barberry. Conclusion: Low costs, stability, Ph and similarity of artificial dyes with natural dyes motivate the producers for high utilization of these dyes without considering their possible hazards and/or their edible quality aspects...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating the states of weakly coupled linear systems from sampled measurements. We assume that <b>the</b> <b>total</b> capacity available to the sensors to transmit their samples to a network manager {{in charge of the}} estimation is bounded above, and that each sample requires the same amount of communication. Our goal is then to find an optimal allocation of the capacity to the sensors so that the average estimation error is minimized. We show that when <b>the</b> <b>total</b> available channel capacity is large, this resource allocation problem can be recast as a strictly convex optimization problem, and hence there exists a unique optimal allocation of the capacity. We further investigate how this optimal allocation varies as the available capacity increases. In particular, we show that if the coupling among the subsystems is weak, then the sampling rate allocated to each sensor is nondecreasing in <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>sampling</b> rate, and is strictly increasing if and only if <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>sampling</b> rate exceeds a certain threshold...|$|R

2500|$|During the Late Triassic Period, the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active {{floodplain}} {{covered by}} forests, {{with a warm}} and humid climate, but subject to seasonal variations including strong rainfall. Vegetation consisted of ferns, horsetails, and giant conifers, which formed highland forests {{along the banks of}} rivers. Herrerasaurus remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. Sereno (1993) noted that Eoraptor was found in [...] "close association" [...] with therapsids, rauisuchians, archosaurs, Saurosuchus and the dinosaurs Herrerasaurus and Pisanosaurus, all of whom lived in its paleoenvironment. Herbivores were represented by rhynchosaurs such as Hyperodapedon; aetosaurs; cynodonts like Probelesodon, kannemeyeriid dicynodonts such as Ischigualastia; and traversodontids such as Exaeretodon. These non-dinosaurian herbivores were much more abundant than early dinosaurs. Dinosaur fossils, including those of Eoraptor only represent approximately 6% of <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> that has been recovered from the Ischigualasto Formation (Rogers et al., 1993), which suggests that dinosaurs were less numerous than other tetrapods.|$|E

The content of Ca spreads between 5 and 219  mg/L, and 20 to 776  mg/L averaging 55 and 144.6  mg/L during post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. The content up to 1, 800  mg/L does not impair any physiological reaction in man (Lehr et al. 1980). High concentration of Ca is not desirable in washing, laundering, and bathing. Although the sources of Ca in groundwater resources are mainly the crystalline limestone associated with khondalitic rocks, the prolonged agricultural activities prevailing {{in the study area}} may also directly or indirectly augment the mineral dissolution in groundwater (Bohlke 2002).
