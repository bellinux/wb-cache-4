5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped under the door, requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings the groceries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> and leaves them at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the blame. The two officers then get a call about the missing delivery boy and head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> to investigate.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the {{television}} series Hawaii Five-0 chose Battleship Cove, a housing community {{just outside the}} dock of the USS Missouri museum, as the location for an episode. The episode, with police cars racing down Tennessee and Nevada Streets, featured a number of Ford Island homes and some residents appeared as extras. That year, Peter Berg featured the USS Missouri in the film Battleship. The ship, which was towed off Ford Island for maintenance, was brought out to sea between completion of the maintenance and its return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> for filming. Michael Carr, president of the Battleship Missouri Memorial, hoped that the film would spike {{the number of visitors}} to the Ford Island museum.|$|E

5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut {{at an angle}} to {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow was packed with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} took place in 1811 to consider how the situation could be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed {{an extension of the}} canal {{to the top of the}} Gwendraeth valley, and another which would cross Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13collieries which would be served in this way. Wharfs at the Llanelli terminus would be built next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a lock and weir, was made for the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{intended}} that the Leeds and Liverpool Canal would be linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> in Liverpool. It {{was only in}} 1846, 30 years after the canal's completion, that the canal was directly linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> via <b>the</b> Stanley <b>Dock</b> Branch. Georges Dock was filled in {{at the beginning of}} <b>the</b> 20th century <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> building of the Liver Building, Cunard Building and <b>the</b> Mersey <b>Docks</b> and Harbour Board Building, now known as [...] "the Three Graces". This meant the North and South Docks were no longer directly linked.

25|$|There is {{one small}} exception: The Holyhead Breakwater Railway, laid for the {{construction}} of the breakwater, was constructed at the broad gauge. Construction finished in 1870, and one locomotive was sold to a local company which had its own sidings leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> It continued to work this isolated network until 1913 when it wore out and the network was regauged.|$|E
25|$|A {{new start}} {{was made on}} {{constructing}} the Falmouth extension, and this was opened on 24 August 1863 (and for goods trains on 5 October). A new dock had been opened at Falmouth since the original plans for the railway, and despite {{the decline in the}} significance of Falmouth docks to the railway company, an extension to that location was made, and a connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dock</b> Company's own rail network was made in January 1864.|$|E

25|$|Around the 1860s, at {{the height}} of the iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built, at Portishead to {{accommodate}} the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. The Portishead power stations were coal-fed power stations built next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Industrial activities ceased in the dock with the closure of the power stations. The Port of Bristol Authority finally closed the dock in 1992, and it has now been developed into a marina and residential area.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s housing {{development}} was scattered across several locations: most was along Pelham Road, {{of which the}} majority was east of the original village (St Andrew's church), centred around the County Hotel, and close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> estate; further development had taken place south and south east of the church, also on Pelham Road, in two locations each centred {{on one of the}} two nonconformist chapels. Almost all the housing was terraced, with the more generous ground plans found moving southwest along Pelham Road. By the mid 1930s the village had grown as much to require a comprehensive school which opened in 1936.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, Diamantina {{left her}} berth {{for the first}} time in 25 years when she was towed out into the river to allow repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> which had been flooded since the seals failed in 1998. On 10 May 2006, she {{returned}} to the South Brisbane Dry Dock adjacent to the Queensland Maritime Museum, where she was used as a self-touring museum ship. During the 2010–2011 Queensland floods, the dry dock flooded but the ship had been maintained in good repair and floated up from the dry dock with the flood, while volunteers adjusted the ropes to prevent the ship bashing against the dry dock. The ship was undamaged.|$|E

25|$|The {{access to}} Swansea {{was of course}} {{important}} both to the railway and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> complex there, and in 1883 a further Bill was promoted, to reach Swansea by tunnelling under the River Neath. Against technical opposition, this was passed. The tunnel would have cost £72,000 and in fact an agreement was reached with the Great Western Railway by which the GWR would carry the R traffic between Port Talbot and the R lines at Swansea. (The existing GWR main line largely paralleled the proposed R line.) This enabled the abandonment of the plans to reach Briton Ferry {{and to make the}} tunnel, and the Company's capital was reduced accordingly, by Act of 1886.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Training Act 1964 {{set up an}} Industrial Training Board to {{encourage}} training for people in work, and within 7 years there were “27 ITBs covering employers with some 15 million workers.” From 1964 to 1968, the number of training places had doubled. The Docks and Harbours Act (1966) and the Dock Labour Scheme (1967) reorganised the system of employment in the docks {{in order to put}} an end to casual employment. The changes made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dock</b> Labour Scheme in 1967 ensured a complete end to casual labour on the docks, effectively giving workers the security of jobs for life. Trade unions also benefited from the passage of the Trade Dispute Act 1965. This restored the legal immunity of trade union officials, thus ensuring that they could no longer be sued for threatening to strike.|$|E
25|$|While under cover, an {{improved}} system was devised for removing Mayfly from the shed. This {{consisted of a}} series of electric winches that could gently ease it out, even in windy conditions, and on 24 September 1911 it was decided to move Mayfly from the hangar for full testing. Just as the nose cleared the hangar door, a gust caused the ship to roll virtually onto its beam ends. It eventually righted, but as it was being swung round so that the nose would point back out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> there were cracking sounds amidships and it broke in two. At that point the centre started to rise, and the crew in the aft gondola dived overboard causing the stern to rise. Subsequent damage was caused by a bracing cable {{on the top of the}} hull, which held fast causing several frames to be severely damaged as the hull was moved by the wind. There were no fatalities, and the wreck was returned to the shed the same day.|$|E
