40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{sequential}} injection system with spectrophotometric detection {{was developed for}} the determination of free and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in wines. It {{was based on the}} formation of a coloured product from the reaction among SO 2, formaldehyde and pararosaniline. A gas diffusion unit (GDU) was incorporated into the manifold to prevent the wine matrix interference in the spectrophotometric measurement. An acid solution was added to the sample prior to its passage through the donor channel of the GDU to promote gaseous SO 2 formation. For the free SO 2 determination, the sample was directly aspirated into the holding coil; for the total SO 2 determination, the sample was processed after previous in-line hydrolysis of bound SO 2 with an alkali solution. Two second-order calibration curves were established, defining two concentration ranges: 2 – 40 mg l− 1 for the free SO 2 determination and 25 – 250 mg l− 1 for the total SO 2 determination. Relative standard deviations (n= 10) were lower than 1. 2 % for the determination of free SO 2 and lower than 2. 3 % for the determination of total SO 2. The sample frequency was about 16 h− 1. This methodology was applied to the determination of free and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in 10 table wines and the results were statistically comparable with those furnished by the recommended procedure...|$|E

Free and bound sulphites were converted to sulphite anions on alkalising the sample solu-tions. On acidifying the solution, the released sulphur dioxide was on-line separated through a semipermeable membrane and transported by an electrolyte into the measuring cell and meas-ured by stripping chronopotentiometry. The proposed method was validated and compared with the three EBC methods. The RSD of repeatability was 8. 6 % for the normal SO 2 level in the beer (3. 4 mg/L). The results corresponded well with those ob-tained with the alternative EBC methods. The elaborated method was much faster and simpler than the EBC methods.

The methodology involves the same colorimetric reaction of the reference method between SO 2, p-rosaniline and formaldehyde.

To isolate the SO 2, a gas-diffusion unit {{was included in the}} system and to minimise p-rosaniline consumption, a merging zones technique was used. The results obtained were in good agreement with a reference method (relative deviations lower than 5 %), the precision being better than 2. 5 % (relative standard deviation). A sampling-rate of 30 samples per hour was obtained and the consumption of p-rosaniline was reduced 10 fold when compared to the reference method...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} key {{results achieved}} by {{an analysis of}} the relation between high-quality simultaneous Dobson, Brewer ground and TOMS-V 8, GOME-WFDOAS satellite total ozone observations for Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. Statistically significant seasonal differences with maxima up to 4 % of monthly averages have been found between Dobson and Brewer measurements during the winter/spring months. These differences can influence estimations of ozone trends if combined data series are used after replacing a Dobson instrument by a Brewer spectrophotometer. The differences can be attributed mostly to the influence of temperature on ozone absorption coefficients and to <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Similar seasonal differences exist between Dobson, GOME and Brewer, TOMS data sets at Hradec Kralove while Dobson versus TOMS and Brewer versus GOME observations fit well with each other within the instrumental accuracy of spectrophotometers. The above findings are supposed to be relevant to other mid and high latitude stations and they have been confirmed by several independent analyses. The conclusions should be considered by data users because the differences between particular ground and satellite data sets can influence validation of satellite ozone observing systems and analyses of recovery of the ozone layer in mid and high latitudes, among others...|$|E
40|$|High {{hydrostatic}} pressure (HHP) has {{shown to have}} an effect of enhancing some properties without detrimental effects on important quality characteristics, such as colour, pH, and turbidity. This suggests that this technique can be used {{as an alternative to the}} existing methods used in wine industry processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HHP on aroma compounds and also sensory and quality properties of young white wine. HHP treatment did not influence physicochemical parameters, total phenols, and flavonoid contents of white wine; however, the results from analysis of wine indicate that there was a great variation in the concentration of free and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SO 2) values and antioxidant capacity of white wine after HHP application. The sensory attributes, such as taste, odour, and overall quality, were not affected by HHP processing at 300 [*]MPa. The chromatic characteristics changed slightly after applying HHP, but these changes could not be visually perceived because they were less than 5 %. The use of this technique has the potential to decrease the amount of SO 2 added to raw grapes thus maintaining the same properties found in untreated wine. This study provided valuable insights into the biochemical and sensory composition of commercial white wine and how this might change during HHP processing...|$|E
40|$|Treixadura {{wines from}} the 1998 vintage were {{obtained}} from traditional vinification in a winery. After alcoholic fermentation, the wine was subjected to ageing in oak barrels for three months. One part of the wine is placed in barrels of American oak and the other part in French oak (Allier oak). Wine stored simultaneously in a stainless steel tank {{was used as a}} control. Chemical composition and volatile compounds of wines were analysed. There were no appreciable differences in alcohol and tartaric acid among the wines stored under different conditions, but differences were observed in pH, total and volatile acidity, reducing sugars, malic and lactic acids. Ageing in oak barrels resulted in an increase in volatile acidity and Folin–Ciocalteu index, and a decrease of free and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Various monoterpenes, norisoprenoids, hexenols, sulphurs, volatile phenols, acetals and lactones increase their content notably when aged in barrels of both American and French oak. On the other hand, some acetates, ethyl esters and fatty acids were present in higher concentrations in the wine stored in stainless steel tank. Sensory results indicated that the wine aged in French (Allier) oak was better scored than when aged in American oak, as it provided subtle and delicate nuances of wood, which did not mask the fruity aroma of the Treixadura wine but contributed to its aromatic complexity...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} sulphur content, CaO/S mole ratio, {{and the amount of}} excess air on the emission of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> during the combustion of coal briquettes were carried out in a 24 cm in diameter, 30 cm high, Thai traditional cooking stove. Sulphur contents and CaO/S mole ratios of coal briquettes ranged from 1 - 5 o/owt. and 0 - 4, respectively. The comparison of the use of coal briquettes with charcoal and firewood was also studied. It can be concluded from the experiments that the concentration of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> was high in the first 10 - 30 minutes of the combustion time. The concentration of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> increased with <b>sulphur</b> content in coal briquettes. The concentration of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> decreased when CaO/S mole ratio increased, and levelf ed off when CaO/S mole ratios were greater than 2. When determining the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> emitted into the atmosphere, comparing to the init ial sulphur content in coal briquettes (i. e., %S emission), it was found that %S emission decreased when sulphur content and CaO/S mole ratio increased. The amount of excess air did not affect o%S emission. The comparison of the use of coal briquettes with charcoal and firewood showed that the concentration of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> from the combustion of coal briquettes was significantly higher than that of charcoal and firewood. The usage efficiency of coal briquettes was found to be higher than that of charcoal and firewood. The ignition time of coal briquettes was significantly longer than that of charcoal and firewood. Recommendations were made such that coal briquettes with sulphur content and CaO/S mole ratio of 2 o/owt. or lower and 2, respectively, be used for household cooking, and an oxidiser be added into coal briquettes in order to shorten the ignition time and to increase the temperature in the first stage of the combustion...|$|R

The second strain was added with or without sterile filtration. We monitored the rate of fermentation; at the end, total and viable cells, percentage of each strain, alcohol, volatile acidity, <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> glycerol, acetaldehyde and volatile compounds were determined. The rate of alcohol production was different during fermentation: at the onset, S 6 u was faster than SBC 2, while lateron it was inverse. When fermentation was stopped simultaneously, S 6 u showed the highest total cell number when grown in pure culture and {{the highest percentage of}} viable cells in mixed culture fermentation. Moreover, S 6 u produced low amounts of alcohol, but more glycerol and volatile compounds (i. e. 2 -phenylethanol, acetates, ethyl esters, and fatty acids) than SBC 2. The co-inoculated and the sequentially inoculated sample, in which S 6 u was the first strain, gave values similar to the pure S 6 u culture. Hence, we conclude that S 6 u prevails over SBC 2 when both strains ferment in a medium. It seems that sequential inoculation of SBC 2 as the second strain is of advantage only with regard to the relatively fast ethanol production...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and fast responding electrochemical sensor is described for {{the determination of}} free and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in wines and grape juices which prevents interferences coming from ethanol and other natural components. It consists of a cell provided with a porous gold working electrode supported on one face of an ion-exchange membrane, acting as a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), which allows gaseous electroactive analytes to be detected. This sensor {{was used as an}} amperometric detector for a flow injection system in which controlled volumes of headspace equilibrated with samples were injected. This approach was adopted to make also possible the determination of total SO(2), avoiding drawbacks caused by the high relative humidity generated by the sample heating resulting from the neutralization reaction of excess NaOH, whose addition was required to release sulphur dioxide from its combined forms. Factors affecting the detection process were examined and optimised. Under the identified optimal conditions, SO(2) detection resulted in sharp peaks which allowed to infer detection limits for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, referred to liquid samples. of 0. 04 and 0. 02 mg L(- 1) for free and total SO(2) which were determined at 20 and 35 degrees C. respectively. Moreover, the responses were found to be characterized by good repeatability (+/- 2 % and +/- 4 %, respectively) and linear dependence on the SO(2) concentration over a wide range (0. 2 - 500 mg L(- 1) for both free and total SO(2)). Finally, the long-term stability of the sensor turned out to be totally satisfactory in that responses changed of +/- 9 % alone even after long periods of continuous use. The application to some commercial wines and grape juices is also presented...|$|E
40|$|NIRS {{has been}} applied for the {{analysis}} of dessert wine Prošek produced from dried grapes of Pošip and Plavac mali cv. in a semi-scaled fermentation. It is a fast and non-destructive analytical method that in association with chemometrics is becoming more frequently used technique. NIR spectra were measured and the relative density, alcohol content, dry extract, reducing sugars, pH, total acidity, volatile acidity, ash, free sulphur dioxide and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> were determined. The range of NIRS used in this paper was 904 – 1699 nm (i. e. 11062 – 5886 cm− 1) because in this range vibrations of C–H, O–H, S–H and N–H bonds can mainly be observed. Using the basic principles of multivariate analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), was used to reduce the input matrix in order to look for significant relationships between the NIR spectra and the observed characteristics of wine Prošek. Chemometrics applied here resulted in further discrimination between samples. The main features of the spectra are absorption bands at 1580 and 1670 nm, which are related to the first overtone of the C–H stretch. Absorption bands around 908 nm, present the stretches related to the 3 rd C–H overtone and 2 nd overtone of the O–H stretch of H 2 O and ethanol. PC 1 and PC 2, the first two components, gave the highest level of classification (≈ 95 %) based on the grape used for wine production {{as well as on the}} added yeast. The potential of NIRS, as a non-destructive method, is screening of basic parameters that are usually determined during the winemaking and ageing of wine.

Finally, correlation spectroscopy (COSPEC) was also implemented in one of the campaigns. Differences in integrated gas column assessment are expected and observed, mostly connected to complex scattering conditions influencing the passive measurements. Since such measurements are much employed in routine volcanic monitoring it is of great interest to model and provide corrections to the raw data obtained. Lidar measurements proved to be quite useful for this purpose.

40|$|Thesis (MSc Food Sc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{study shows}} the {{potential}} of near infrared spectroscopy for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of wine and brandy in the distilling industry. Wines intended for further processing by the distillation industry have to meet certain specifications to ensure an efficient and cost-effective distilling process with a suitable product yield. Certain compounds have, therefore, been recognised as significant quality parameters and through their regulation, a product of consistent quality can be ensured. These quality parameters include alcohol, total acid, volatile acid, <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> total phenolics, reducing sugars and acetaldehyde concentrations and pH. The effective control of all these compounds in the wines prior to distillation, is critical to maintain the feasibility and efficiency of the process. Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) {{can be used as}} a rapid and accurate analytical method for the determination of alcohol concentrations in distilling and brandy base wine. The choice of path length for the liquid sampling cell is an important consideration. In this study, alcohol with its strong absorption of OH bands in the near infrared region was not significantly affected, but difference in path length showed a significant influence on the prediction of the volatile acid concentration in distilling wine. Very strong correlations were found between the spectral data and the alcohol concentration data in distilling wine (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) and brandy base wine (r = 0. 92, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Good predictions were obtained for the volatile acid content of brandy base wine (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1) but better accuracy could be obtained by incorporating a wider concentration range and more sensitive, although not the accepted reference methods, such as HPLC and GC, into the modelling. In contrast to the brandy base wine, the much cruder, turbid distilling wine (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1) yielded poor calibration results for volatile acid. FT-NIRS can also be used as a rapid screening method to measure the total acid content, pH and total phenol levels in brandy base wine samples. Satisfactory predictions were obtained for the total acid content (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) and total phenol levels (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 mq. L" GAE). The SEP of all the parameters compared well with the SEL and were within acceptable limits. The range of the concentration measurements were, however, very narrow and the accuracy of these models (measured as the ratio of the range to the standard error of prediction) were all below 10, indicating that modelling of these parameters in brandy base wine should be attempted with reference values covering a wider range. Poor correlations and predictions were obtained between the wine spectral data and the acetaldehyde (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), residual sugar (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 mq. L") concentration data. The unique character of potstill distillates, originating from the grape cultivar, type and age of the oak casks, lends itself to the development and blending of different brandies. The process of blending and correcting the brandy is necessary to obtain a product and brand of established and recognised character. The brandy is generally divided into different classes prior to blending based on the degree of "smoothness" or "hardness" of the matured distillate as determined by a sensorial panel. The ideal would, however, be to replace this subjective evaluation method with a more objective approach, such as an instrumental method like NIRS. Near infrared spectroscopy showed potential to successfully discriminate and classify brandy samples in terms of their sensorial classification status. The near infrared spectra of unblended three-year old brandies were measured and discriminant analysis performed using the subjective sensory classification data of the brandy. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) models were developed by calculating separate peA (principal component analysis) models for each of the classes for which qualitative analysis were required. An assessment of class membership of an unknown sample was made on the basis of the distance to the cluster centroid. Two types of NIRS instruments, a Fourier transform near infrared system and a diode array spectrophotometer were employed to examine the discriminatory abilities of NIRS. Excellent predictions (90. 9 %- 100 %) were obtained for the "smoothest" and "hardest" classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons with FT-NIRS. For the diode array spectra reasonable classification data were obtained for all the classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons, as well as an excellent classification rate (100 %) of the smoothest class in the 1999 season. Prediction results for class membership of the brandy samples from the three season's combined data did not deliver satisfactory discriminatory results. By applying NIRS and SIMCA, rapid and objective classification of brandy samples within seasonal context can be established to enhance the blending processes. Having accurate reference data in the calibration set is essential in near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The precision (usually decided by blind duplicate determination) of the reference data serves as the performance target for correlation-based near infrared analysis. The differences between reference values obtained from two independent laboratories and the Foss Winescan FT 120, which is also a predictive method, for the alcohol and volatile acid determinations in distilling wine and between two independent laboratories for the measurement of the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> content, were investigated. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis (Bonferroni testing) revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between all three measurements for the volatile acid analysis. One laboratory differed significantly from the other two measurements in its measurement of the alcohol content in distilling wine. A paired t-test performed on the two laboratories' values obtained for <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between the two sets of results. This study restated the importance of obtaining reliable reference data for calibration purposes to maintain the efficiency and accuracy and therefore the reputability of NIRS as an accurate and reliable analytical method. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hierdie studie dui op die potensiaal van naby infrarooi spektroskopie (NIRS) vir beide die kwalitatiewe en kwantitatiewe analise van wyn en brandewyn in die distillasie industrie. Sekere spesifikasies word gestel waaraan wyn met voldoen voor dit verdere prosessering tydens distillasie kan ondergaan. Die regulering van wynkwaliteit is noodsaaklik om die distilleringsproses ekonomies volhoubaar te maak. Sekere komponente in die wyn het 'n direkte invloed op die kwaliteit van die eindproduk en word beskou as betekenisvolle parameters wat beheer moet word om 'n produk van konstante hoë kwaliteit te lewer. Hierdie parameters sluit alkohol, titreerbare suur- en vlugtige suurinhoud, asook die pH, totale swaweidioksied, totale fenol vlakke, reduserende suikers en asetaldehied konsentrasies in. Die regulering van al hierdie komponente in die wyne is essensieel voor die aanvang van distillasie om die effektiwiteit en produktiwiteit van die proses te verseker. Fourier transformasie naby-infrarooi spektroskopie (FT-NIRS) kan benut word as 'n vinnige en akkurate analitiese metode om die alkohol konsentrasie in stook- en rabatwyn te bepaal. 'n Geskikte padlengte kuvet moet gekies word vir die ontleding van vloeistof monsters met NIRS. In hierdie studie is gevind dat die voorspelling van alkoholkonsentrasie in wyn, nie soseer beïnvloed is deur die keuse van padlengte nie. 'n Vlugtige komponent soos asynsuur, wat die maatstaf van die vlugtige suurinhoud van die wyn is, word egter regstreeks beïnvloed deur die keuse van padlengte. 'n Sterk korrelasie is gevind in die datastel vir die alkoholinhoud van die stookwyn (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) en rabatwyn (r = 0. 92, SECV = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Baie goeie voorspellings is ook gevind vir die vlugtige suurinhoud van rabatwyn (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1). Die akkuraatheid van die metode (uitgedruk as die RER waarde) het egter aangedui dat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang en meer akkurate verwysingswaardes gebruik moet word om 'n geskikte model vir vlugtige suur kwantifikasie in rabatwyn te bewerkstellig. In teenstelling met die resultate verkry vir die rabatwyn, het die ruwer, turbiede stookwyn swak gekalibreer vir die vlugtige suurinhoud (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1). FT-NIRS kan ook gebruik word as 'n vinnige seleksie metode om titreerbare suur vlakke, pH en totale fenolinhoud van rabatwyn monsters te bepaal. Sterk korrelasies is in die datastel gevind vir die titreerbare suurinhoud (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) en totale fenol vlakke (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 rnq. L" GAE) van rabatwyn. Die SEP waardes verkry vanaf die NIRS bepalings het baie goed vergelyk met die standaard foute wat verkry is vir die chemiese bepalings. Die konsentrasie omvang van die verwysingswaardes was, egter, beperk en die akkuraatheid van die NIRS modelle (uitgedruk as die verhouding tussen die konsentrasie omvang en die standaard fout van voorspelling) was laer as 10. Dit het daarop gedui dat die NIRS kalibrasie van die parameters eerder uitgevoer moet word met monsters wat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang dek en gemeet is met meer sensitiewe analitiese metodes soos HPLC en GC. Die kalibrasie en voorspelling van die asetaldehied inhoud (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), reduserende suiker konsentrasie (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") en totale swaweldioksiedinhoud (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 rnq. L") het onaanvaarbare voorspellings gelewer. Die unieke karakter van potketel distillate wat bepaal word deur die druifkultivar, tipe en ouderdom van die eikehoutvate, bied die potensiaal vir die ontwikkeling en versnyding van verskillende style brandewyn. In 'n poging om 'n produk en handelsnaam van erkende en gevestigde karakter te verkry, moet die brandewyn eers versny word na veroudering. Die brandewyn word geklassifiseer in verskillende style op grond van sensoriese gehalte. NIRS is gebruik as 'n vinnige tegniek om te onderskei tussen verskillende style onversnyde drie jaar-oue brandewyn. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) modelle is ontwerp deur aparte PCA (hoof komponent analise) modelle vir elke klas waarvoor kwalitatiewe analise vereis is, te ontwikkel. 'n Skating van klas lidmaatskap van 'n onbekende monster is gemaak deur die afstand van die monster na die groepsmiddelpunt te bereken. Twee soorte NIRS instrumente, 'n FT-NIR en 'n diode array spektrofotometer is gebruik tydens die studie om die diskrimineringsvermoë van elk te ondersoek. Uitstekende voorspellings (90. 9 %- 100 %) is gekry vir die "sagste" en "hardste" klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene met FTStellenbosch NIRS. Met die diode array spektra is redelike klassifikasie resultate verkry vir al die klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene, asook 'n uitstekende klassifikasie (100 %) vir die sagste klas binne die 1999 seisoen. Voorspellings vir klas lidmaatskap van die brandewyn monsters vir die drie seisoene se gekombineerde data het egter onaanvaarbare diskriminasie resultate gelewer. NIRS en SIMCA sal 'n vinnige en objektiewe klassifikasie proses van onversnyde brandewyn monsters kan meebring wat tot voordeel van die versnydings- en produksieproses sal wees. Hierdie voorspellings sal egter binne seisoensverband moet geskied. Akkurate verwysingsdata in die kalibrasie datastel is 'n essensiële fasset van naby infrarooi spektroskopie. Die presisie (bepaal deur blinde duplikaat bepalngs) van die verwysingsdata dien as 'n prestasie teiken vir korrelasie-gebaseerde naby infrarooi voorspellings. Die verskille tussen die data verkry vir die alkohol- en vlugtige suurinhoud van stookwyn deur twee onafhanklike laboratoriums en 'n instrumentele metode (Foss Winescan FT 120) asook die verskille tussen die data verkry van twee laboratoriums vir die totale swaweidioksied metings, is ondersoek. ANOVA en post-hoc toetse het aangedui dat al die data verkry vir die vlugtige suur bepalings, statisties betekenisvol van mekaar verskil het (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Overall, {{chemical}} and microbiological analyses {{are very important}} for the quality of wine during and after winemaking process. One of the most important factors during wine storage is the temperature of storage. During storage of red wines in tanks, barrique barrels or glass bottles underway many physical, {{chemical and}} biochemical changes, which have significant influence for the stabilize of taste, scent, colour and general character of wine. The aim of our study we used two different wines, specifically Cabernet Sauvignon and Blaufränkisch and chemically and microbiologically analysed these wines during storage at different temperatures. These wines were bottled in 2011 and 2013. We stored these samples at different temperatures. The first four samples were stored at 6 - 8 °C in refrigerator, and the next four were stored at 20 - 25 °C in room temperature. We had together eight wine samples. We had determined in all wine samples sequentially the free and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> content, ethyl-alcohol content, extract, sugars, total and volatile acids. The wine sample Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 at 6 - 8 °C had content 12, 14 % ethyl-alcohol, 2. 3 % sugars, 5. 6 % total acids, 0, 444 g. L- 1 volatile acids, 25. 6 g. L- 1 extract, 8 mg. L- 1 free SO 2 and 18 mg. L- 1 total SO 2. The wine sample Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 at 20 - 25 °C had content 12, 05 % ethyl-alcohol, 2. 4 % sugars, 5. 6 % total acids, 0, 456 g. L- 1 volatile acids, 27. 4 g. L- 1 extract, 6 mg. L- 1 free SO 2 and 18 mg. L- 1 total SO 2. The wine sample Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 at 6 - 8 °C had content 11, 98 % ethyl-alcohol, 1. 8 % sugars, 5. 9 % total acids, 0, 324 g. L- 1 volatile acids, 25. 7 g. L- 1 extract, 24 mg. L- 1 free SO 2 and 42 mg. L- 1 total SO 2. The wine sample Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 at 20 - 25 °C had content 11, 98 % ethyl-alcohol, 1. 8 % sugars, 5. 9 % total acids, 0, 324 g. L- 1 volatile acids, 25. 7 g. L- 1 extract, 24 mg. L- 1 free SO 2 and 42 mg. L- 1 total SO 2. These results were collected from one measuring, but we had results from three measuring for one wine sample. Microbiological parameters were observed during wine storing after filtration through different microfilters. We determined the total count of bacteria (TCB), Acetobacter cells, Lactobacillus cells, yeast and molds in wine samples with classic plate dilution method. The highest quality wines from microbiological properties were wines from 2013, which was filtered through microfilter and aseptically filled into the bottles, but wines from 2011 was filtered through cross-flow filter and samplesdirectly collected from the storage tanks without microfiltration...|$|E

Totally, 110 yeast isolates were collected, at the beginning, in the middle {{and at the end of}} alcoholic fermentation, from which 84 isolates were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RAPD-PCR allowed species identification of the isolates and confirmed the results of phenotypic classification of S. cerevisiae strains. Method of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtDNA RFLP) was also applied and the high genetic heterogeneity revealed at intraspecies level indicates that the discrimination ability of mtDNA analysis was superior comparing to RAPD-PCR. Heterogeneity of technological characteristics was also studied concerning the following oenological criteria: the ability to produce hydrogen sulfide, low foaming ability, resistance to high <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentrations up to 300 mg/L, growth and beginning of fermentation in the presence of ethanol up to 12 %, ability to grow at high temperatures up to 42 oC, sugar exhaustion ability, fermentation rate, resistance to killer yeasts toxins, glycerol and acetic acid production. Heterogeneity of biochemical characteristics of the tested strains was also studied. The following were examined: enzyme profile, production of biogenic amines, probiotic properties. The enzymes esterase, esterase/lipase, leucine aminopeptidase, valine aminopeptidase, cystine aminopeptidase, acid phοsphatase, α-glucosidase were detected in all tested strains. Phosphohydrolase activity was also exhibited and detected in all but strain BM 10. Although each strain exhibited unique enzyme profile, the highest activity was detected for leucine aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase and α-glucosidase, while the mean activity of cystine aminopeptidase was considerably lower. Concerning probiotic properties of 27 S. cerevisiae strains, tolerance to high bile concentrations was evaluated. Results showed that an increase in biles concentration led to decrease of strain viability Concerning the effect of low pH, an average decrease 47 % of viability was observed after one hour and 71, 8 % after four hours of incubation, at pH 3, 0. There were strains with viability decrease over 90 % (AM 4, AM 8, AT 6) while other strains exhibited no significant decrease. In extreme acidic conditions (pH 1) the population decrease was very high (> 90 %) and independent of incubation time and vinification type. Concerning the assimilation of cholesterol, highest assimilation ability was exhibited by strains BT 7, BT 1, AA 3 and AT 2 with a reduction of 16, 7 %, 15, 9 %, 15, 7 % and 14, 5 % respectively. Finally, concerning interactions with pathogenic bacteria, Yersinia enterocolitica was inhibited by strain AA 4, Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by strains AA 4, AM 9, AT 6, VM 3, VM 5, VM 10, Bacillus cereus was inhibited by strains AT 6, VM 1, VM 7, Candida albigans was inhibited weakly by strains AT 6, VM 3, while against Escherichia coli there was not any inhibition action...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Wine Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Bacteriocins are ribosomally {{synthesized}} antimicrobial peptides {{produced by}} bacteria and are active against other bacteria, {{either in the}} same species (narrow spectrum) or across genera (broad spectrum). The application of bacteriocins during the vinification process might help to prevent the production of undesired compounds by inhibiting the indigenous bacterial microflora and allowing malolactic fermentation to be conducted by a selected bacterial strain. Furthermore, the use of bacteriocins might allow reducing the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> amount in wine. The {{purpose of this study}} was the selection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) belonging to the genera Oenococcus, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus with the ability to produce bacteriocins, with respective biological activity against undesired indigenous wine LAB and the capability to complete malolactic fermentation. The first objective of this study was the screening of LAB isolated from South African red wines for the production of bacteriocins. Only 27 strains out of 330 wine isolates, belonging to the species Lb. plantarum, Lb. paracasei, Lb. hilgardii and O. oeni, showed activity towards various wine-related and non wine-related indicator strains with the colony-overlay method. It is the first time that bacteriocin activity is reported in O. oeni. The second objective was the detection and identification of known structural bacteriocin genes of Lb. plantarum wine strains. Furthermore, the web server BAGEL was used to in silico analyse putative bacteriocin-encoding genes in the genome of O. oeni and primers were designed to amplify four possible bacteriocin-encoding genes. A PCR-based screening revealed the presence of the plantaricin encoding genes plnA, plnEF, plnJ and plnK in five selected Lb. plantarum strains. Moreover, PCR analysis rendered positive results with all four chosen putative bacteriocin-encoding genes in the eight tested O. oeni strains with antimicrobial activity. The latter genes of O. oeni were heterologously expressed in different Escherichia coli host strains, but no antimicrobial activity could be detected. The third objective of this study was the transformation and expression of the heterologous bacteriocin genes nisin A and pediocin PA- 1 in two selected Lb. plantarum strains. To enhance their antimicrobial activity a plasmid containing the nisin A gene was successfully cloned into the two strains. Indeed, an enhanced antimicrobial activity could be detected, but the transformed plasmid was not stable. The fourth objective in this project was the evaluation of bacteriocin production in liquid media. A co-culture experiment with a plantaricin producing Lb. plantarum strain and an Enterococcus faecalis strain as indicator was performed. A complete inhibition of cell growth of Ent. faecalis was observed within 72 hours. The last objective was the evaluation of the impacts of phenolic compounds on the activity of nisin and pediocin. The short term influence of two phenolic acids, two flavan- 3 -ols, grape tannins and oak tannins on the activity of nisin and pediocin PA- 1 was investigated. No influence on the activity was detected. Furthermore, synergistic effects on bacterial growth inhibition were observed. This study confirms the potential use of either bacteriocin additives or bacteriocin-producing LAB in order to control the bacterial microflora during the vinification process...|$|E
40|$|Today?s {{wine market}} is {{becoming}} more and more saturated. At given conditions, the understanding of the consumer needs and preferences determines the success of a wine producer. The value of white and rosé wines appreciated by the consumers lies in their fruity and fresh character. Wine oxidation is one of the major wine failures. Recently, it has been reported that up to 48 % of the wines rated as faulty by judges in wine competitions exhibited off-flavours that can be linked to the erroneous management of oxygen. Wine exposure to oxygen is possible throughout the whole winemaking process and depends on process conditions and applied equipment. Oxygen can be dissolved in wine up to 8. 8 mg/L at normal conditions. After dissolution, oxygen concentration in liquid phase is normally decreasing to undetectable content due to chemical reactions of molecular oxygen with other wine constituents. Wine oxidation is a complex process. The effects may vary significantly influenced by numerous factors, including a type of wine, operation, oxygen amount chemical composition of wine, pH, storage temperature, light exposure, metal content and redox state of wine. Oxygen has a potential to support positively, and subsequently to ruin aroma and colour of wine. Most white wines are negatively affected by small amounts of dissolved oxygen provoking rapid aroma loss and oxidative browning, thus decreasing attractiveness for consumers, whereas in red wines microoxygenation may help to stabilise wine colour and remove reductive off-flavours. Up to now, most of the research on wine oxidation was focused on experiments in model solutions. Although these studies deliver valuable information about oxidation mechanisms, there was, however, limited data published on real wine experiments linking analytical data and sensory analysis. Consequently, the background of the present investigations was comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the various factors influencing wine oxidation in real wine medium, and finally the development of innovative strategy for quality improvement and shelf-life extension of white wines. Comparison of different methods for O 2 and CO 2 measurement in wine The initial part of the present work was to determine a reliable quantification method for dissolved oxygen quantification in wine medium. Since dissolved carbon dioxide present in wine may influence the oxygen concentration, its amount should also be taken into account. Thus, development of dissolved carbon dioxide determination was of major importance for the further experiments described in this thesis. The main aim of the first study was to give a review of the oxygen and carbon dioxide measurement principles and to compare several instruments for carbon dioxide and oxygen measurement in wine available in the market. For carbon dioxide determination, CarboQC, Orbisphere 3658 and agitation cylinder were used. Oxygen measurements were conducted with PreSens, OxyQC and Orbisphere 3650. Sample bottles were prepared with concentrations in the range from 0 to 2200 mg/L for carbon dioxide and from 0 to 12 mg/L for oxygen, respectively, dissolved in white wine of Müller Thurgau variety. O 2 and CO 2 measurements with six instruments were sequentially conducted at 20 °C after 10 minutes shaking of trial bottles. Subsequently calculated concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide were used for correlation regression tests. From the data obtained for CO 2, three investigated instruments showed good repeatable measurement results (R 2 = 98 %) in the range from 0 to 1500 mg/L. However, in the wine samples oversaturated with CO 2 (> 1500 mg/L at 20 °C) CarboQC and Orbisphere 3658 showed significantly higher precision (R 2 = 99 %), compared to the agitation cylinder, due to carbon dioxide losses during filling of the cylinder. As for oxygen data, results obtained with each of the measurement devices (PreSens, OxyQC and Orbisphere 3650) demonstrated good correlation with the initial oxygen amount in wine samples (R 2 = 98 %) in the whole monitored range of dissolved oxygen concentrations. However, due to the flexibility of PreSens mini-sensor application inside the bottle and noninvasive measurement, this technique was found to be more advantageous, compared to the other two. Additionally, it allowed not only determination of dissolved oxygen, but also of the gaseous oxygen concentration in a bottle headspace. For these reasons, the PreSens device was chosen for further experiments. Effect of Headspace Volume and Iron and Copper Addition on Oxidation Processes in Model Solution and Riesling Wine: Chemical and Sensory Changes Since previous studies in model solutions published by other authors clearly showed the key role of iron and copper in oxidation reactions in wine, the main aim of this part of the thesis was to compare the effects of oxygen and iron and copper additions on oxygen consumption rate, sulphur dioxide and colour of bottled model solution and actual wine with similar properties. Model solution was prepared of deionised water, glycerol, (+) -tartaric acid, ethanol, gallic acid and potassium metabisulfite to reach a free sulphur dioxide concentration of 50 mg/L. 200 L Riesling wine (vintage 2010) was prepared using standard winemaking techniques and equipment, and was subsequently treated with potassium ferrocyanide to eliminate iron and copper. Model solution and Riesling wine were bottled in 500 mL bottles with and without small additions of iron (0. 1 mg/L) and copper (0. 05 mg/L). Oxygen concentration in bottles was adjusted using various headspace volumes (0, 50 and 100 mL for model solution, and 0, 20 and 40 mL for Riesling, respectively) full of ambient air. Iron and copper concentration, total consumed oxygen, sulphur dioxide, browning rate (E 420) were monitored. Additionally, sensory analysis of bottled Riesling wines (triangle tests and descriptive analysis) was conducted after 90 and 240 days of storage. The results revealed major differences between model solution and real wine. In model solution the headspace volume and the metal addition contributed to significant changes in total consumed oxygen, colour, and free sulphur dioxide. The metal addition increased the rate of the molecular oxygen consumption and resulted in elevated consumption of free SO 2. Enhanced colour was observed in all wines, where iron was added. The experiment with Riesling wine with similar parameters showed strong influence of the headspace volume. The rate of oxidative browning and oxygen consumption rate strongly correlated with the headspace volume at the bottling. In contrast to model solution experiment, addition of small concentrations of iron and copper did not contribute to the colour and oxygen consumption rate of Riesling wine. Sensory analysis showed that the wines bottled with 0, 20 mL and 40 mL HS volume became significantly different already after three months of storage at 15 °C, which was proved by the triangle tests. Descriptive analysis after six and nine months of storage confirmed negative influence of headspace volume, thus proving the significance of oxygen ingress at bottling on wine quality. Moreover, traces of metals in Riesling wines even in the wines with no iron and copper addition were sufficient to initialise oxidation processes. However, since small iron and copper additions had significant impact on model solution, further studies with Riesling wine needed to be conducted. The Impact of Headspace Oxygen and Copper and Iron Addition on Oxygen Consumption Rate, Sulphur Dioxide Loss, Colour and Sensory Properties of Riesling Wine For further investigation of the impact of iron and copper on white wine oxidation, Riesling wine was bottled with the addition of 1 mg/L of iron and 0. 5 mg/L of copper, which correspond to average iron and copper concentrations in wines of Baden-Württemberg. Oxygen concentrations were determined, as previously reported, by the headspace volume in the bottle (0 mL, 10 mL and 20 mL) full with ambient air. In contrast to the previous experiment, addition of 1 mg/L of iron and 0. 5 mg/L of copper had significant influence on the oxygen consumption rate, on the loss of free SO 2 during storage, and on the sensory changes in wine. Addition of iron and copper significantly catalysed the oxygen consumption. Free sulphur dioxide loss was found to be proportional to the total consumed oxygen after bottling. Moreover, in all wines with iron and copper addition free sulphur dioxide decay was significantly elevated compared to wines with no iron and copper addition. Although colour changes were not observed in wines after 90 days of storage, significant sensory changes were detected. Both oxygen and iron and copper addition made an impact on sensory evaluation of wines. At low oxygen concentration (0 mL headspace) metal addition had positive effect resulting in elimination reduced aromas. In contrast, for 10 mL and 20 mL headspace, wines with iron and copper addition showed lower scores in fruity, citrus, tropical aromas, and elevated scores in untypical aging and had pronounced oxidised character. The results of the study indicate that, in the case of Riesling wine, excessive oxygen exposure due to oxygen present in the headspace of the bottle should be avoided. Moreover, iron and copper concentration also seems to make significant impact on oxygen and SO 2 consumption rates and on sensory perception of wines. These findings suggest that iron and copper concentrations should also be taken into account, when oxygen management strategy is defined. Effect of Headspace Volume, Ascorbic Acid and Sulphur Dioxide on Composition and Sensory Profile of Riesling Wine In the last part of the present work the effects of different oxygen and free SO 2 levels, and ascorbic acid addition on the development of white wine were investigated. Riesling wine was bottled in 500 mL bottles with four different headspace volumes (0 mL, 10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL), two levels of free SO 2 (50 mg/L and 70 mg/L), and with and without ascorbic acid (250 mg/L) addition. Dissolved oxygen and the oxygen in headspace were measured in the resulting 17 wines. Free and total SO 2 concentrations, ascorbic acid concentration, colour, redox potential, and antioxidative capacity were measured regularly in wine samples. After six months of storage, the wines were evaluated using sensory descriptive analysis. It was again proved that wine exposure to oxygen at bottling plays a key role in white wine development during storage. High oxygen ingress may greatly influence the redox state of wine and affect the important quality parameters including colour, free and total SO 2, and the overall sensory quality of wine. Free and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> loss and the decline in ascorbic acid could be linked to the total consumed oxygen content. It was observed that in the presence of ascorbic acid less sulphite was consumed. Ascorbic acid addition also contributed to the fruity and fresh character of the bottled wines, which indicates its strong antioxidant. However, when combined with high oxygen concentration, ascorbic acid addition promoted enhanced white wine browning. This was scavenged in the wines with higher free SO 2 concentrations. Based on the data shown, careful control of the oxygen ingress during bottling is crucial for white wine quality. Ascorbic acid addition seems to have positive sensory effects on the development of wines during the post-bottling period. However, the possible wine browning, associated with ascorbic acid, should be taken into account. On the contrary, sulphur dioxide, in case of the Riesling wine studied, seems to be less effective to prevent negative sensory effects in wines due to excessive exposure to oxygen, but may simultaneously decrease oxidative browning in wines with ascorbic acid addition. In summary, low oxygen ingress at bottling combined with low iron and copper concentrations, moderate additions of ascorbic acid and sulphur dioxide seem to be a good oxygen management strategy and offer a good potential to improve quality and extent the shelf-life of white wines. Der Weltweinmarkt und speziell der europäische Weinmarkt wird heute oft als übersättigt angesehen. Der Erfolg einzelner Weinproduzenten hängt daher vom Verständnis und der Adaption an die Bedürfnisse der Verbraucher ab. Bei Weiß- und Roséweinen schätzen Verbraucher derzeit besonders einen fruchtigen, frischen Charakter. Oxidative Noten sind unerwünscht. Dennoch gehören sie zu den häufigsten Weinfehlern. Aus Weinwettbewerben wurde berichtet, dass bis zu 48 % der fehlerhaften Weine von den Prüfern wegen Oxidationsnoten beanstandet wurden. Sauerstoff kann vom Wein während des ganzen Weinbereitungsprozesses aufgenommen werden. Die Sauerstoffaufnahme hängt im Wesentlichen von den Prozessen und der verwendeten technologischen Ausstattung ab. Unter normalen Bedingungen kann Sauerstoff bis zu 8. 8 mg/L im Wein gelöst werden. Gelöster Sauerstoff in Wein wird in der Regel durch chemische Reaktionen von molekularem Sauerstoff mit Weininhaltsstoffen bis unter die Nachweisgrenze verringert. Die vielfältigen Reaktionen der Weinoxidation sind sehr komplexe Prozesse. Ihre Auswirkungen variieren erheblich. Beeinflussende Faktoren sind Weintyp, Weinbehandlung, Sauerstoffmenge, chemische Zusammensetzung des Weines, pH-Wert, Lagertemperatur, Belichtung, Metallgehalt und Redox-Zustand des Weines. Die Wirkung von Sauerstoff ist äußerst komplex, die Weinfarbe und das Aroma kann verbessert oder gar ruiniert werden. Weißweine werden durch Sauerstoff häufig negativ verändert. Der Sauerstoff führt hier zu schnellem Aromaverlust bis hin zu oxidativer Bräunung. Gerade dies wird vom Verbraucher oft negativ bewertet. Bei Rotweinen hingegen kann Sauerstoff gezielt eingesetzt werden um die Farbe zu stabilisieren oder reduktive Aromen zu entfernen. Die Forschung über Weinoxidation konzentriert sich derzeit auf Experimente in Modell-Lösungen. Diese Studien geben wertvolle Informationen über Mechanismen und Hintergründe der Oxidation. Jedoch befassen sich derzeit nur wenige Experimente mit echtem Wein. Bei echten Weinen bietet sich die Möglichkeit analytische und sensorische Daten miteinander zu verknüpfen. Wichtiger Punkt der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die umfassende Bewertung verschiedener Einflußfaktoren auf die Weinalterung. Aus den Ergebnissen wurde eine Strategie für die Verbesserung der Qualität und einer Verlängerung der Haltbarkeit von Weißweinen entwickelt. Methodenvergleich zur O 2 -und CO 2 - Bestimmung im Wein Der erste Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit besteht in der Bestimmung von zuverlässigen Methoden zur Quantifizierung des gelösten Sauerstoffs im Wein. Da das gelöste Kohlendioxid im Wein die Sauerstoffkonzentration beeinflussen kann, wurde die CO 2 -Menge ebenfalls berücksichtigt. Folglich war die Entwicklung einer Methode zur Kohlendioxid-Bestimmung auch von großer Bedeutung für die weiteren Versuche, die in dieser Arbeit beschrieben sind. Das Hauptziel der ersten Studie war es, einen Überblick zu aktuellen Sauerstoff- und Kohlendioxid-Messmethoden zu geben sowie verschiedene auf dem Markt verfügbare Instrumente für Kohlendioxid- und Sauerstoff-Messung in Wein zu vergleichen. Sauerstoff-Messungen wurden mit PreSens, OxyQC und Orbisphere 3650 durchgeführt. Zur Kohlendioxid-Bestimmung wurden CarboQC, Orbisphere 3658 und Schüttelzylinder verwendet. Probenflaschen wurden mit Konzentrationen im Bereich von 0 bis 2200 mg/L für Kohlendioxid und von 0 bis 12 mg/L für Sauerstoff abgefüllt. O 2 - und CO 2 - Messungen erfolgten mit den sechs Instrumenten nacheinander bei 20 °C, nachdem die Flaschen für 10 Minuten geschüttelt wurden. Die anschließend berechneten Konzentrationen an Sauerstoff und Kohlendioxid wurden für die Erstellung von Korrelationen und Regression-Tests verwendet. Die drei untersuchten Instrumente für CO 2 -Bestimmung zeigten reproduzierbare Messergebnisse (R 2 = 98 %) im Bereich von 0 bis 1500 mg/L. Doch in den Weinproben bei dem 20 °C übersättigten Bereich (> 1500 mg/L) zeigten CarboQC und Orbisphere 3658 signifikant höhere Präzision (R 2 = 99 %) im Vergleich zum Schüttelzylinder. Dies ist logisch, da während der Befüllung des Zylinders das Kohlendioxid verloren geht. Die Ergebnisse der Sauerstoff-Messungen deuteten darauf hin, dass PreSens, sowie auch OxyQC und Orbisphere 3650 eine im gesamten überwachten Bereich der Sauerstoffkonzentrationen verlässliche und kongruente Werte liefern. Aufgrund der Flexibilität der Minisensoren, die direkt in die Flasche eingeklebt werden können, erwies sich die nicht-invasive O 2 -Messung mittels PreSens als vorteilhaft. Darüber hinaus erlaubt diese Technik nicht nur die Bestimmung vom gelöstem Sauerstoff, sondern auch die Messung vom gasförmigen Sauerstoff im Kopfraum. Aus diesen Gründen wurde das PreSens-Gerät für weitere Experimente ausgewählt. Einfluss vom Kopfraumvolumen und Eisen- und Kupfer-Zugabe auf Oxidation in Modell-Lösung und Riesling Wein: chemische und sensorische Veränderungen In früheren veröffentlichten Studien in Modell-Lösungen wurde die wichtige Rolle von Eisen und Kupfer in Oxidationsreaktionen in Wein deutlich gezeigt. Im zweiten Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Wirkungen von unterschiedlichen Sauerstoff-Mengen bei der Abfüllung untersucht. Des Weiteren wurde der Einfluss von Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusätzen auf die Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Schwefeldioxid und Farbe in Modell-Lösung und Riesling Wein geprüft. Die Modell-Lösung wurde aus hochreinem Wasser, Glycerin, (+) -Weinsäure, Ethanol, Gallussäure und Kaliummetabisulfit zusammengestellt, außerdem wurde die SO 2 -Konzentration auf 50 mg/L eingestellt. 200 L Riesling (Jahrgang 2010) wurde unter Verwendung von Standard-Techniken der Weinbereitung produziert und anschließend mit Kaliumhexacyanoferrat behandelt, um die Metalle bzw. Eisen und Kupfer zu entfernen. Modell-Lösung und Riesling wurden in 500 -mL Flaschen mit und ohne Zusatz von Eisen (0. 1 mg/L) und Kupfer (0. 05 mg/L) abgefüllt. Die Sauerstoffkonzentration in Flaschen wurde mit Luft im Kopfraum (0, 50 und 100 mL für Modell-Lösung und 0, 20 und 40 mL für Riesling) eingestellt. Die Eisen- und Kupferkonzentrationen, Gesamtmenge an verbrauchtem Sauerstoff, Schwefeldioxid, Absorption (E 420) wurden während der Lagerzeit beobachtet. Zusätzlich wurde die sensorische Bewertung von Riesling Weinen mittels Dreieckstests und deskriptiver Analyse nach 90 und 240 Tagen Lagerung durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten große Unterschiede zwischen der Modell-Lösung und dem Riesling Wein. In der Modell-Lösung hatte das Kopfraumvolumen und der Metall-Zusatz dazu beigetragen, dass wesentliche Änderungen in Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Farbe und freiem Schwefeldioxid entstanden. Der Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusatz erhöhte die Geschwindigkeit des Sauerstoff-Verbrauchs und führte zu erhöhtem Verbrauch der freien SO 2. Die intensive Farbentwicklung wurde in allen Weinen mit Eisen-Zusatz festgestellt. Das Experiment mit Riesling mit vergleichbaren Parametern zeigte einen starken Einfluss des Kopfraumvolumens. Die Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate und die oxidative Bräunung korrelierten stark mit dem Kopfraumvolumen. Im Gegensatz zum Modell-Lösung-Experiment hatte die Zugabe von geringen Mengen an Eisen und Kupfer keinen Einfluss auf die Farbe und den Sauerstoffverbrauch im Riesling Wein. Sensorische Unterschiede zwischen den Weinen mit 0, 20 und 40 mL Kopfraum wurden bereits nach drei Monaten Lagerung bei 15 °C durch die Dreieckstests nachgewiesen. Die deskriptive sensorische Analyse nach sechs und neun Monaten Lagerung bestätigte den negativen Einfluss von großem Kopfraumvolumen. Dies beweist die große Bedeutung der Sauerstoffaufnahme bei der Abfüllung auf die Weinqualität. Außerdem waren Metallmengen im Riesling Wein, auch in den Varianten ohne Eisen- und Kupferzusatz ausreichend, die Oxidationsprozesse zu initialisieren. Da die geringen Eisen- und Kupferzugaben eine erhebliche Wirkung in der Modell-Lösung und nicht im Wein hatten, waren weitere Studien mit größeren Mengen an Eisen und Kupfer in Riesling Wein erforderlich. Einfluss von Sauerstoff im Kopfraum, Eisen- und Kupferzusatz auf Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Schwefeldioxidverlust, Farbe und sensorische Eigenschaften von Riesling Wein Um die Wirkung von Eisen und Kupfer weiter auf Weißweinoxidation zu untersuchen, wurde Riesling Wein mit/ohne Zugabe von 1 mg/L Eisen und 0. 5 mg/L Kupfer abgefüllt. Dies entspricht den durchschnittlichen Eisen- und Kupfer-Konzentrationen in Weinen aus Baden-Württemberg. Die Sauerstoffmengen wurden mit verschiedenen Kopfraumvolumen in den Flaschen (0, 10 und 20 mL) bestimmt. Im Gegensatz zum vorangegangenen Versuch, hatte die Zugabe von 1 mg/L Eisen und 0. 5 mg/L Kupfer einen signifikanten Einfluss auf den Sauerstoffverbrauch, Verlust von freiem SO 2 während der Lagerung und auf die sensorischen Eigenschaften im Wein. Der Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusatz katalysierte deutlich den Sauerstoffverbrauch. Der Schwefeldioxid-Verlust war proportional zur Gesamtmenge an verbrauchtem Sauerstoff. Zusätzlich wurde der SO 2 -Abbau in allen Varianten mit Eisen und Kupfer im Vergleich zu den Varianten ohne Eisen- und Kupferzugabe signifikant erhöht. Obwohl die Farbänderungen nach 90 Tagen Lagerung nicht festgestellt werden konnten, waren die erheblichen sensorischen Veränderungen bereits erkennbar. Der Sauerstoff, wie auch der Eisen- und Kupferzusatz hatten Einfluss auf die sensorische Bewertung der Weine. Bei niedrigen Sauerstoffkonzentration (0 mL Kopfraum) hatten Metalle durch die Eliminierung von reduzierten Aromen eine positive Wirkung. Die Weine mit 10 und 20 mL Kopfraum und zugesetztem Eisen und Kupfer zeigten geringere Ausprägungen in Attributen wie Frucht, Citrus, tropischen Aromen und erhöhte Werte in UTA und hatten einen deutlichen oxidierten Charakter.

The pollution of air in many Chinese cities exceeds both {{national and international}} standards due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and increased energy consumption. At present China becomes the highest <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> emitter in the world due to its reliance on coal for energy generation. The Government of China has taken different steps to reduce <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and succeeded from the 11 th Five-Year Plan. Breathing in <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> can irritate the nose, throat and the lungs, causing phlegm, coughing, shortness of breath, development of bronchitis and other respiratory diseases, as well as aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease.

In {{order to}} provide {{information}} {{for the development of}} clean coal technology, the sulphur self–retention and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> capturing properties of minerals present in low grade coals was investigated. This study consisted of detailed mineral analyses of coal and ash samples using results obtained from QEMSCAN and separate retention (coal) and capture (ash) experiments with laboratory scale reactors. Typical South African coal samples were used in this study. The ash content varied between 37. 0 wt % and 47. 9 wt % with active calcium oxide (from calcite and dolomite) present between 1. 22 wt % and 4. 92 wt %. The <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> content ranged between 0. 60 wt % and 1. 90 wt % and was distributed between sulphate minerals, pyrite and organically associated minerals in the coal macerals. The calcium to sulphur ratio based on the active calcium ranged from 0. 64 to 3. 20. Sulphur self–retention experiments (using powders of particle sizes ranging from 212 um to 300 um) were carried out in a Packed Bed Balance Reactor at 900 oC at atmospheric pressure with dry air for a period of 12 h. Transformation of a large fraction of the calcium bearing minerals to sulphates was evident with <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> self–retention between 22. 9 % and 66. 9 % and the formation of calcium containing non–crystalline phases. Thermogravimetric Analyzer experiments using 1 mm diameter coal particles were carried out with the ash prepared (in situ with air) prior to the actual sulphation determinations. After attaining a stable ash mass, the gas stream was changed to the <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> containing mixture (3000 ppm SO 2, 8. 0 % CO 2, 8. 0 % O 2 and 83. 7 % N 2) and the increase in mass {{as a result of the}} reaction of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (and oxygen) with calcium oxide (calcite and dolomite) was recorded. Conversion of active calcium bearing phases in the presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> containing gas mixture, similar to the gas released during fluidised bed combustion, was employed to evaluate the desulphurisation potential of the coal ashes, and it was found that nearly 40 % of the active calcium oxide was converted after 90 min reaction time at 900 ºC and that no blocking of pores occurred as a result of solid phase changes. A mathematical model based on the shrinking core model with diffusion through the product layer as the determining mechanism was found to describe the overall reaction rate. Master...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of free molecular and bound forms of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and oxygen on the viability and culturability of a selected strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus and a selected strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in wine. Methods and Results: Acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts associated with wine spoilage were isolated from bottled commercial red wines. One bacterium, A. pasteurianus strain A 8, and one yeast, B. bruxellensis strain B 3 a, were selected for further study. The resistance to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the effect of oxygen addition on these two selected strains were determined by using plating and epifluorescence techniques for monitoring cell viability in wine. Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 was more resistant to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than B. bruxellensis B 3 a, with the latter being rapidly affected by a short exposure time to free molecular form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> As expected, neither of these microbial strains was affected by the bound form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The addition of oxygen negated the difference observed between plate and epifluorescence counts for A. pasteurianus A 8 during storage, while it stimulated growth of B. bruxellensis B 3 a. Conclusions: Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 can survive under anaerobic conditions in wine in the presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Brettanomyces bruxellensis B 3 a is more sensitive to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than A. pasteurianus A 8, but can grow in the presence of oxygen. Care should be taken to exclude oxygen from contact with wine when it is being transferred or moved. Significance and Impact of the Study: Wine spoilage can be avoided by preventing growth of undesirable acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts through the effective use of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the management of oxygen throughout the winemaking process. © 2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

40|$|Iron(II), <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and sugars such as lactose are {{potential}} reducing agents for manganese dioxide to produce manganese(II) for subsequent hydrometallurgical treatment. The leaching of limonitic laterite and manganiferrous ores with <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> produces iron(II) {{which in turn}} can catalyse the leaching of manganese dioxide in acid media. This paper presents a critical analysis of the kinetics of reductive dissolution of synthetic manganese dioxide and manganese ore to compare and contrast the effect of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and iron(II) in acid media containing sulphate or perchlorate anions. Both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms are considered {{in the case of}} <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The current knowledge on chemical speciation is used to construct an Eh-pH diagram to show the effect of complexation of Mn(II), Fe(II) and Fe(III) with sulphate.

Intact chloroplasts {{isolated}} from <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> fumigated Hardwickia binata leaves showed inhibition of PS II electron transport activity without any {{significant effect on}} photosystem I. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> exposed leaves accumulated more hydrogen peroxide than those from non-fumigated plants and this was caused by increase in superoxide radical production. Hydrogen peroxide formation was inhibited by addition of cytochrome C and superoxide disrnutase. In <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> fumigated leaves, increase in superoxide dismutase activity showed resistance to sulphite toxicity. The localization of ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities in chloroplasts provide evidence for the photogeneration of ascorbate. The scavenging of hydrogen peroxide in chloroplast due to ascorbate regenerated from DHA by the system: PS I →Fd → NADP → glutathione.
