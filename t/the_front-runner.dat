5|$|In 1991, Jones was <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> for the {{governorship}} {{for the entire}} gubernatorial campaign. The rivalry between Jones and Wilkinson had become so strong that Wilkinson's wife Martha was among Jones' challengers in the Democratic primary; she ended her candidacy 18days before the primary. Advocating campaign finance reform, Jones garnered 184,703 votes in the primary, enough to best a field including Scotty Baesler (149,352 votes), Dr. Floyd Poore (132,060 votes), and Gatewood Galbraith (25,834).|$|E

5|$|Ferraro ran {{campaigns for}} {{a seat in the}} United States Senate from New York in 1992 and 1998, both times {{starting}} as <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> for her party's nomination before losing in the primary election. She served as a United States Ambassador to the United NationsCommission on Human Rights from 1993 until 1996 during the presidential administration of Bill Clinton. She also continued her career as a journalist, author, and businesswoman, and served in the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator Hillary Clinton. Ferraro died on March 26, 2011, from multiple myeloma, 12 years after being diagnosed.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{announced}} his candidacy on January 18, 1971, during a televised speech {{from the studios}} of KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the time of his announcement, McGovern ranked fifth among Democrats in a presidential preference Gallup Poll. The earliest such entry since Andrew Jackson was designed to give him time to overcome the large lead of <b>the</b> <b>front-runner,</b> Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. Nevertheless, by January 1972, McGovern had only 3percent national support among Democrats in the Gallup Poll and had not attracted significant press coverage.|$|E
5|$|Dunbar {{drops out}} of the race due to the {{discovery}} of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin {{a few days before the}} attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates <b>the</b> <b>front-runner,</b> Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E

50|$|As <b>the</b> two <b>front-runners</b> {{concentrated}} on attacking each other, Rounds insisted on running a positive campaign {{and was not}} attacked by his opponents. Rounds' positive image and extensive knowledge of state government won him many supporters who were alienated by <b>the</b> <b>front-runners.</b> On <b>the</b> day of the primary election, Rounds won a stunning victory, with 44.3% of the vote to Barnett's 29.5% and Kirby's 26.1%.|$|R
25|$|Anson Chan and Regina Ip {{are without}} doubt <b>the</b> <b>front-runners</b> in this election. Chan is {{supported}} by the pan-democrats, while Ip has the blessing of the pro-Beijing forces, and the pro-business Liberal Party.|$|R
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|Nine cities {{submitting}} bids to {{host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, and Paris—from which London eventually prevailed; thus becoming the first city {{to host the}} Olympic Games for a third time. The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics {{was considered one of}} the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC. Paris was seen by some as <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of its bid.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez entered spring {{practice}} {{after the}} 2008 season as <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> {{to take over}} the starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from redshirt freshman Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, a transfer from Arkansas, where he had been the starting quarterback; Mustain, like Sanchez, was named the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of high school career in 2006. By the end of spring practice, Carroll announced Sanchez would be the starting quarterback heading into the fall. During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez dislocated his left kneecap during warm-ups prior to practice; trainers immediately put the kneecap back into place. After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against Virginia. Before the opener, Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks—Carson Palmer, Leinart and Booty—who wished him well and offered general advice.|$|E
50|$|Abu Ismail {{applied to}} be a {{candidate}} for the Egyptian presidential election of May 2012. As of early April 2012, he was considered one of <b>the</b> <b>front-runners,</b> and enjoyed notable displays of popular support.|$|R

50|$|In {{media reports}} and the betting markets, <b>the</b> <b>front-runners</b> were friends Nick Clegg (Home Affairs spokesperson) and Chris Huhne (Environment spokesperson). Huhne {{ran in the}} 2006 {{leadership}} election, coming second to Campbell, whom Clegg had supported.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrest. Strauss-Kahn, who was head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and considered <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> in the French presidential election, was accused of sexually assaulting a maid at a midtown Manhattan hotel in May 2011. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but quit his IMF post, and his presidential candidacy was sidetracked. Subsequently, the case against him weakened as prosecutors said his accuser admitted to lying to a grand jury about events surrounding the attack. Franco Nero portrays a Strauss-Kahn like character, Roberto DiStasio, but he is an Italian dignitary. Ron Rifkin plays DiStasio's defense attorney, who is similar to Strauss-Kahn's real life attorney, Benjamin Brafman.|$|E
5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin {{appeared to be}} <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then {{drop out of the}} race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{entered the}} 46th Congress in March 1879. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party {{included}} the Greenbackers in its caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing {{the use of}} the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would {{put an end to the}} sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas, he was soon considered <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> for the presidential nomination in 1880.|$|E
50|$|Local and {{national}} polling indicated in March 2010 that Cox {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>front-runners</b> for <b>the</b> Republican nomination, potentially defeating his potential Democratic opponents in the 2010 gubernatorial election by comfortable margins in hypothetical match-ups.|$|R
5000|$|NASCAR's [...] "tire war" [...] was notable {{during the}} 1994 season. Both Goodyear and Hoosier tires {{were used by}} entrants. Many of <b>the</b> <b>front-runners</b> {{utilized}} Goodyear. Among the top teams using Hoosier tires was Geoff Bodine.|$|R
50|$|Prince of Penzance pulled {{ahead of}} <b>the</b> <b>front-runners</b> only around 100m from the finish of the race, {{surprising}} many, including Payne. Payne's technique focused on galloping, {{due to her}} belief that doing so was key to winning.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire {{and ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as <b>the</b> <b>front-runner.</b> Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.|$|E
5|$|On {{his first}} day of free agency on July 1, 2010, Malhotra signed a three-year, $7.5 million deal with the Vancouver Canucks that {{included}} a no-trade clause. Malhotra was named an alternate captain during away games for the Canucks before the season began. He scored his first goal as a Canuck on October 22, during a 5–1 win against the Minnesota Wild. Malhotra settled into to the Canucks' lineup as the team's third-line centre, often playing with wingers Raffi Torres and Jannik Hansen, while playing significant time on the penalty kill and matching up against opposing team's best forwards. His success as a defensive specialist earned him early consideration for the Selke Trophy as the league's best two-way forward. In {{an article on the}} NHL's website, he was chosen as <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> for the award at the mid-way point of the campaign. He was also credited with allowing the team to use Ryan Kesler in a more offensive role (Kesler was the team's previous shutdown centre); as a result, the second-line centre recorded career-highs in goals and points.|$|E
5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became <b>the</b> <b>front-runner,</b> capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Seven {{candidates}} {{ended up}} filing for the mayoral office before the cut-off date on June 23. <b>The</b> <b>front-runners</b> include <b>the</b> incumbent mayor Kriseman and former mayor Baker, with minor candidates including Cates, Nevel, Congemi, Lassiter, and Barnwell.|$|R
50|$|Latvia {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>front-runners</b> of GISs. World Bank (2011) {{reported}} that Latvia has stopped offering AAU sales because of low AAU prices. In 2010, Estonia was the preferred source for AAU buyers, followed by the Czech Republic and Poland.|$|R

5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was <b>the</b> <b>front-runner</b> throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{resumption}} of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett, a captain in the army, had been a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi in Singapore for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his {{way back into the}} Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker had joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a gunner and was killed in a duel with Nazi fighter pilots over Soltau in Germany. This left Tallon as <b>the</b> <b>front-runner,</b> but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a more youthful keeper like Gil Langley or Ron Saggers with an eye to the future. With the pressure of selection on his head, Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after {{the resumption}} of cricket, against New South Wales in Brisbane, including three stumpings and three catches from the leg spin of Colin McCool, a future Test team-mate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership. Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand. Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.|$|E
