5|$|Lamarck's {{evolutionary}} theory made little immediate {{impact on his}} fellow zoologists, or on <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>at</b> the time. The historian of science Richard Burkhardt argues that this was because Lamarck was convinced his views would be poorly received, and made little effort to present his theory persuasively.|$|E

5|$|As a wanted criminal, Anarky's {{methods and}} goals were {{described}} as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>at</b> large, relegating him to underground operation.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, the {{building}} underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, Frank Lloyd Wright was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>at</b> this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago. Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>at</b> large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler weather radar, as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected.|$|E

In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E
