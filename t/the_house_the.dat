5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> <b>The</b> Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> <b>The</b> same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E

The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related financial stress from which the family could not recover.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Johnson {{returned}} to the House of Representatives. The legislature appointed him to the Senate in 1819 to fill the seat vacated by John J. Crittenden. As his prominence grew, his interracial relationship with Julia Chinn, an octoroon slave, was more widely criticized. It worked against his political ambitions. Unlike other upper class leaders who had African American mistresses but never mentioned them, Johnson openly treated Chinn as his common law wife. He acknowledged their two daughters as his children, giving them his surname, much {{to the consternation of}} some of his constituents. The relationship is believed to have led to the loss of his Senate seat in 1829, but his Congressional district returned him to <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>the</b> next year.|$|E

Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903).
