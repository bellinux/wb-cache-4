5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> at Gedi vary in size, {{their number}} of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> while wells were present in the courtyards of some of <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E

Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, possibly by the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. The Jewel Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> joining them and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E

Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind.|$|E
