5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> at Gedi vary in size, {{their number}} of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court.

One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> while wells were present in the courtyards of some of <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
