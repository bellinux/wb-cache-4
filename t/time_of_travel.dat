It then heads west, intersecting with the first line at Kronstad, runs through a tunnel before serving the areas of Fyllingsdalen. The line can use parts of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's right of way from the city center to Kronstad, and would feature a station under the hospital, which is Western Norway's largest work place. It is not planned an extension to Loddefjord and Storavatnet from Fyllingsdalen at this time because the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> will be {{much higher than the}} direct bus line using the highway to the city center.|$|E

As the BCHL also communicated they were not interested in expansion at that time, the group additionally pursued relocation of an existing team to Dawson Creek. However, at a late-2006 meeting, the BCHL board of governors voted to not accept the Dawson Creek application as a potential site for a team, citing delays with the construction of the Multiplex arena and a question over compensation for the expenses of visiting teams. On appeal, the BCHL reversed this decision two months later and actively considered both Dawson Creek and Wenatchee, Washington, as possible sites for a requested relocation of the Williams Lake TimberWolves. The BCHL noted two concerns with a Dawson Creek team: the cost and <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> required (at the time the league's most northerly team was the Prince George Spruce Kings) to reach the city and the lack of a rival team. To address these concerns, the Society attempted to initiate a Fort St. John team, as well, who would be a rival to Dawson Creek and enable a northern division within the BCHL.|$|E

5000|$|Different from {{instantaneous}} speed, {{average speed}} {{is defined as}} the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h). Average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel),</b> and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed.

40|$|Ordinarily, {{philosophers}} {{arguing for}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> restrict themselves to defending <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> against allegations <b>of</b> inconsistency and contradiction. These objections are usually based on particular theories about time and causality. I believe, however, that this way of arguing can be turned on its head. By using the conceivability thesis – that is, the thesis that if something is conceivable, then {{it is also possible}} – we can put forward a positive argument {{for the possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel,</b> and then consider how this should inform our metaphysical views. I do this by assuming the truth of the conceivability thesis and then presenting a simple piece <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> fiction. I argue for the conceivability of this story and, in doing so, attempt to show that the time travel journey it describes is logically possible. I then develop this argument by considering other more controversial cases <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel.</b> I make minor alterations to the original time travel story in order to show {{that there are a number}} of different kinds <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> journeys (including cases of both forwards and backwards time travel) which are conceivable and, therefore, logically possible. Finally, I ask how the conceivability of different types <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> should affect the metaphysical views we choose to adopt. I argue that since the conceivability <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> entails the logical possibility of journeys to other times, any plausible theory <b>of</b> <b>time</b> must be able to accommodate such journeys. I also explain how the conceivability <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> entails the logical possibility of two particularly unusual cases of causation. I argue that the conceivability <b>of</b> instantaneous <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> entails the logical possibility of causation at a distance, and that the conceivability <b>of</b> backwards <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> entails the logical possibility of backwards causation. Any plausible theory of causation must therefore be able to account for the possibility of these two types of causation. I consider one particular theory of causation which does not (namely, that put forward by D. H. Mellor), and then attempt to establish where it goes wrong...|$|R
