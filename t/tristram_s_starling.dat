40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{aimed to}} demonstrate {{the ways in which}} visual and discursive modes interact with one another in Jean Paul 2 ̆ 7 s Flegeljahre, Laurence Sterne 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Tristram</b> Shandy, and Denis Diderot 2 ̆ 7 s Le Neveu de Rameau so as to facilitate pluralistic and dynamic modes of reading and viewing, and thereby challenge monolithic or reductionist approaches to visual and verbal representation. The prominent scholars of text-image relationship, and poststructuralist semiotics have discussed how logocentrism, imagocentrism, and ocularcentrism has been/can be made to cooperate in an attempt to render the universe intelligible and transparent, and to represent a strictly ordered, and hierarchically categorized universe, with its clear demarcations between subject and object, inside and outside, body and soul, reality and fiction. Gestures and speech as they are thematized in the three works accentuate the elusiveness and multi-facetedness of each other, instead of reducing them linearly to pre-established meanings. Narrative language ‘gestures’ {{in the sense that it}} stimulates the participatory involvement of the readers, and fosters ongoing semiotic processes. The shifting contextuality and positionality of linguistic elements problematize the notion of language as a static system with fixed, discrete categories, independent of its transmission mechanisms. The metaphoric and dialogic aspects of narrative trigger multiple images which are interrelated, interinfluential, and which constantly transform one another. They can be conceived of as thought-processes that never attain finality. They are always contingent, and in a non-resolvable tension, a process that does not lend itself to fixation, arrestation, or categorial abstraction. Thus, the interaction of text and image in Jean Paul 2 ̆ 7 s Flegeljahre, Laurence Sterne 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Tristram</b> Shandy, and Denis Diderot 2 ̆ 7 s Le Neveu de Rameau open insights into new modes of textuality and visuality, which cannot be restricted to logocentric or ocularcentric frameworks. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background European {{starlings}} (Sturnus vulgaris) are an invasive {{bird species}} {{known to cause}} damage to plant and animal agriculture. New evidence suggests starlings may {{also contribute to the}} maintenance and spread of diseases within livestock facilities. Identifying and mitigating the risk pathways that contribute to disease in livestock is necessary to reduce production losses and contamination of human food products. To better understand the impact starlings have on disease transmission to cattle we assessed the efficacy of starling control as a tool to reduce Salmonella enterica within a concentrated animal feeding operation. We matched a large facility, slated for operational control using DRC- 1339 (3 -chloro- 4 -methylaniline hydrochloride, also 3 -chloro p-toluidine hydrochloride, 3 -chloro- 4 -methylaniline), with a comparable reference facility that was not controlling birds. In both facilities, we sampled cattle feed, cattle water and cattle feces for S. enterica before and after starling control operations. Results Within the starling-controlled CAFO, detections of S. enterica contamination disappeared from feed bunks and substantially declined within water troughs following starling control operations. Within the reference facility, detections of S. enterica contamination increased substantially within feed bunks and water troughs. Starling control was not observed to reduce prevalence of S. enterica in the cattle herd. Following starling control operations, herd prevalence of S. enterica increased on the reference facility but herd prevalence of S. enterica on the starling-controlled CAFO stayed at pretreatment levels. Conclusions Within the starling-controlled facility detections of S. enterica disappeared from feed bunks and substantially declined within water troughs following control operations. Since cattle feed and water are obvious routes for the ingestion of <b>S.</b> enterica, <b>starling</b> control shows promise as a tool to help livestock producers manage disease. Yet, we do not believe starling control should be used as a stand alone tool to reduce S. enterica infections. Rather starling control could be used as part of a comprehensive disease management plan for concentrated animal feeding operations. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is primarily}} concerned with the interrelation and friction between the domains of the aesthetic and the erotic. Through detailed readings of works by Laurence Sterne, Soren Kierkegaard, and Roland Barthes, it attempts to show that these authors have paid systematic attention to this question, {{and that they have}} produced [...] despite their differences [...] theoretical formulations which have a great deal in common. In each case, theory cannot be distinguished from practice; and, in each case, the textual strategies and conceptual configurations involved are sufficiently close to justify a single label: 2 ̆ 2 irony. 2 ̆ 2 ^ Part One of the dissertation consists of a discussion of Sterne 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Tristram</b> Shandy. Part Two [...] the longest part [...] is concerned with Kierkegaard 2 ̆ 7 s The Concept of Irony. Part Three consists of discussions of Kierkegaard 2 ̆ 7 s Either/Or (Volume I) and selected works by Barthes. Various other authors and theorists are appealed to along the way, including Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Schlegel, V. N. Volosinov, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Particular attention is given to the general problem of conceptual and semiotic indeterminancy, a problem which is currently of interest {{in a number of different}} disciplines. The dissertation argues that the special relation of the aesthetic and the erotic in the West derives from the way in which aspects of indeterminacy have been highly determined in the general textual and semiotic practice of the West. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Patterns of {{resource}} partitioning among 4 sympatric sturnids: [black-collared starling (Sturnus nigricollis), pied <b>starling</b> (<b>S.</b> contra), common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and crested myna (A. javanicus) were determined {{based on their}} food habits, foraging and nesting microhabitat selection, morphology and behavior. The study was conducted from March 1986 to June 1988 at and around Bang Pra Game Sanctuary, Cholburi, Thailand. Diets of adults and nestlings of all species were significantly different. The 4 species exhibited significant differences in morphology, primarily in trophic (bill shape and length) and locomotive (wing shape and size) appendages that affect selection of foraging microhabitat and hence choice of diets. Selection of nest site characteristics was significantly different among the species and was associated with types of tree i. e., palm vs non-palm (trees with forks or branches), distance of nest tree from human habitation and distance of nest tree from seasonal or permanent waters. The pied starling, common myna and crested myna all selected different foraging habitats and used different techniques for foraging,-however the black-collared starling shared foraging habitat with the other 3 species. Breeding success, breeding chronology, and clutch sizes were similar for the 4 species. These 4 sympatric sturnids partitioned their resources through differences in morphology, which, in turn, affected their foraging habitat selection and modes of foraging, and hence, differences in diet. Behavioral differences also segregated their foraging techniques and nest site selection...|$|R
40|$|The 1969 - 70 {{nationwide}} winter {{inventory of}} blackbird-starling roosts and populations was {{conducted during the}} period December 20 -January 31 by the Division of Wildlife Research, U. S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. The Patuxent Wildlife Research Center coordinated the survey for the East (31 States), and the Denver Wildlife Research Center for the West (17 States). Success depended on extensive cooperation from many sources: Bureau agencies, especially the Division of Wildlife Services; other Federal and State conservation and agricultural departments; the Audubon Society; ornithological clubs; and individual bird students. In all, 674 roosts were reported-— 262 in the East and 412 in the West. The total estimated population was 340 million birds: 267 million blackbirds and starlings in the East and 73 million in the West. The national population was composed of 10 species, about as follows: 40 percent red-winged blackbirds, 20 percent starlings, 20 percent common grackles, 15 percent brown-headed cowbirds, 3 per¬cent Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s blackbirds, and 1 percent rusty blackbirds; the other 1 percent included boat-tailed grackles, yellow-headed blackbirds, tricolored blackbirds, and bronzed cowbirds. Of the 262 roosts reported in the East, 77 were classed as major (a million or more birds each) and 57 as large (hundred thousand—million birds each); these 134 roosts contained 265 million of the 267 million blackbirds and starlings reported in the East. Of the 412 roosts in the West, 24 were major and 41 were large; these 65 roosts contained 70 of the 73 million Western birds reported. Thus, 98 ½ percent of the U. <b>S.</b> blackbirds and <b>starlings</b> found were in 199 roosts (101 major roosts and 98 large roosts), or in 30 percent of the 674 reported roosts...|$|R
40|$|Revivals of {{the eighteenth}} century novel and revivals of {{material}} culture are closely related. Whether one is mourning the lost bagel of the past or the lost novel, a complex form of nostalgia is at work. Historians of the novel Ian Watt, Michael McKeon, J. Paul Hunter, Lennard Davis, and many others are participants in the continuous re-invention of an invented tradition. Similarly, a number of novelists, reviving a great deal of eighteenth century discourse on genre, historiography, and aesthetics, partake of a nostalgia for novelty, a lost time when the European novel might truly have been novel. While these invented histories both need and oppose each other, neither are historical. The twin ideologies are revivals of a complex set of ambivalent metaphors and narratives that were parables of loss, regret, and repetition in their original form. The nostalgic fatalism of the past is recycled into the fatalism of the present, transforming that fatalism into a form of optimism. I trace the journey of this metaphor through Pierre Marivaux 2 ̆ 7 s Pharsamon, Henry Fielding 2 ̆ 7 s Tom Jones, Laurence Sterne 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Tristram</b> Shandy, and Denis Diderot 2 ̆ 7 s Salon de 1765 and Jacques le fataliste. Simultaneously, I discuss its revival in Thomas Pynchon 2 ̆ 7 s Mason and Dixon, Susan Sontag 2 ̆ 7 s The Volcano Lover, Robert Glück 2 ̆ 7 s Jack the Modernist, Salman Rushdie 2 ̆ 7 s Midnight 2 ̆ 7 s Children, and Milan Kundera 2 ̆ 7 s Les testaments trahis. I employ both folklore studies—Neil Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 s Transforming Tradition and Richard Handler and Jocelyn Linnekin 2 ̆ 7 s “Tradition: Genuine or Spurious”—and the genre theory of Gerard Genette, Philippe Lacoue-Labarth, and Jacques Derrida to extend discussions of nostalgia in Susan Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s Crimes of Writing and Svetlana Boym 2 ̆ 7 s The Future of Nostalgia. Finally, I suggest that many traditional debates and distinctions—novel and romance, realism and self-consciousness—are spurious rather than genuine. ...|$|R
