5|$|Reagan {{ran against}} Democratic {{incumbent}} Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John B. Anderson. He was praised by supporters {{for running a}} campaign of upbeat optimism. Aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election {{marked the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era,</b> and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in at the age of 70.|$|E

25|$|Supply side {{economics}} dominated <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era.</b> During {{his eight}} years in office the national debt more than doubled, from $907 billion in 1980 to $2.6 trillion in 1988, and consumer prices rose by more than 50%. But despite cuts in income tax rates, federal income tax revenues grew from $244 billion in 1980 to $467 billion in 1990. The real median family income, which had declined during the previous administration, grew by about ten percent under Reagan. The period from 1981 to 1989 {{was among the most}} prosperous in American history, with 17 million new jobs created.|$|E

It was an early champion of free-market liberalization and globalization, which was only just gaining ground at the time.|$|R

25|$|Although {{poetry in}} {{traditional}} classical forms had mostly {{fallen out of}} fashion by the 1960s, the practice was kept alive by poets of great formal virtuosity like James Merrill (1926–1995), author of the epic poem The Changing Light at Sandover, Richard Wilbur, and British-born San Francisco poet Thom Gunn. The 1980s and 1990s saw a re-emergent interest in traditional form, sometimes dubbed New Formalism or Neoformalism. These include poets such as Molly Peacock, Brad Leithauser, Dana Gioia, Donna J. Stone, Timothy Steele, and Marilyn Hacker. Some of the more outspoken New Formalists have declared that the return to rhyme and more fixed meters {{to be the new}} avant-garde. Their critics sometimes associate this traditionalism with the conservative politics of <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>era,</b> noting the recent appointment of Gioia as Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts. More recent examples of New Formalism, however, have sometimes crossed over into the more experimental territory of Language poetry, suggesting that both schools are being gradually absorbed into the poetic mainstream.|$|E

The Bill Clinton administration is often treated {{as an extension of}} <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era,</b> as is the George W. Bush administration. Historian Eric Foner noted that the Obama candidacy in 2008 [...] "aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Edgar Lee Masters {{called the}} speech, [...] "the {{beginning}} of a changed America." [...] Bryan's words gave rise to later economic and political philosophies, including Huey Long's 1930s Share Our Wealth program, with its trigger phrase, [...] "Every Man a King" [...] inspired by Bryan's speech. Author and political commentator William Safire, in his political dictionary, traced the term [...] "trickle-down economics" [...] (common in <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>era)</b> to Bryan's statement that some believe that government should legislate for the wealthy, and allow prosperity to [...] "leak through" [...] on those below. Historian R.

500|$|Others {{were less}} enamored with Ferris, many taking {{issue with the}} film's [...] "rebel without a cause" [...] hedonism. David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>era's</b> near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|R
50|$|Parting Glances is an American film shot in 1984 and {{released}} in 1986. With its realistic look at urban gay life in <b>the</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>era</b> and at <b>the</b> {{height of the}} AIDS crisis, many film critics consider it an important movie {{in the history of}} gay cinema.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2012. Major: Communication Studies. Advisor: Laurie Ouellette. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 229 pages. This dissertation examines family sitcoms {{in the context}} of <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>era's</b> perceived "crisis in the family" and gendered shifts in domestic life. Through a combination of Foucaultian and feminist theories, I ask how television sitcoms shape family life. I look at popular long-running programs like Who's the Boss?, Full House, and Family Ties as pedagogical texts that offered guidelines to viewers struggling with competing ideas about family, gender, parenting, and domestic labor. While providing lessons in household governance, these sitcoms simultaneously enact liberal feminist fantasies of work and domesticity. By bringing together historical analysis of the television industry during the late-network era with a look at policy and political objectives, I show that networks were seeking to appeal to upwardly mobile "career women," thus the proliferation of sitcoms dealing with non-nuclear families and the reorganization of housework arrangements...|$|R
500|$|The {{same year}} the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most {{of it was}} {{recorded}} in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, [...] "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but focused mainly on rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics targeted at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. [...] "Dumb All Over" [...] is a tirade on religion, as is [...] "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration {{as well as their}} use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like [...] "Society Pages" [...] and [...] "I'm a Beautiful Guy" [...] show Zappa's dismay with <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>era</b> and its [...] "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".|$|E
500|$|Woolverton created Belle {{as part of}} [...] "her self-directed {{mandate to}} move women and girls forward." [...] The Express-Times {{described}} the character as an intelligent young woman who [...] "sings songs about reading and wanting to gain knowledge, rather than falling in love." [...] Woolverton credits Belle's knowledge and love of books with providing the character with a [...] "point of view {{of her life and}} that doesn't necessarily involve a man getting her there." [...] One of the film's main themes, Belle is considered an outsider because her love of reading provides her with knowledge of the outside world as opposed to her [...] "narrow-minded" [...] village peers. Writing for Wired.com, Matt Blum dubbed Belle [...] "the geekiest heroine of any Disney animated film", exemplified by an opening number that demonstrates just how much she does not fit in with her peers due to her intelligence and active imagination. Similarly, Boxoffices Amy Nicholson coined the character [...] "Disney's Smartest Heroine," [...] while Rob Burch of The Hollywood News observed that the character [...] "comes across as arrogant at times" [...] because she [...] "spends much of the first act complaining." [...] In her book Sex, Love and Abuse: Discourses on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, author Sharon Hayes described Belle as [...] "the quintessential beautiful young ingenue." [...] Comparing Belle's personality to that of the princess in the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale [...] "The Frog Prince", The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook author Jerry Griswold described the character as a similarly [...] "feisty and outspoken" [...] heroine. Writing for St. Francis Xavier University, Dawn Elizabeth England observed that Belle possesses equally as many traditionally feminine as she does masculine traits, citing her bravery, independence and assertiveness as masculine, and her sensitivity and fearfulness as feminine. According to Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> author Susan Jeffords, [...] "Belle's credentials as heroine are established ... when she {{is the only one of}} the town's single women not to swoon over Gaston," [...] while the character's love of reading is essentially manipulated [...] "to mark her as better than the rest of the townspeople." [...] Writing for The Statesman, David O'Connor cited Belle's intelligence and bibliophilia as [...] "in stark opposition to the insensitive and significantly dim-witted Gaston." [...] Critics continue to debate over whether Belle or the Beast is the film's protagonist. Susan Jeffords, author of Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era,</b> felt that although Belle appears to be the protagonist in Beaumont's original fairy tale, the character becomes [...] "less the focus of the narrative" [...] in Disney's adaptation and more of a [...] "mechanism for solving the Beast's 'dilemma'." [...] In her article [...] "The Tangled Evolution of the Disney Princess", Noelle Buffam felt that Belle arrived just in time when Disney's heroines were [...] "in a dire need for some change," [...] awarding her [...] "the red stamp of approval" [...] for her intelligence and spirit.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

500|$|Today, Thriller {{is still}} viewed in a {{positive}} light by critics some three decades later. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the record had something to interest everyone.

He went on to compliment [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" [...] and said, [...] "The record's two best songs: 'Billie Jean, ... and the delirious 'Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', the freshest funk on the album [...] the most claustrophobic, scariest track Jackson ever recorded." [...] Erlewine gave the opinion that it was an improvement on the artist's previous album, although he was critical of the title track, describing it as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and as having the effect of [...] "arriving {{in the middle of the}} record and sucking out its momentum". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Jon Pareles commented that Jackson [...] "doubled his ambitions and multiplied his audience" [...] with the album and wrote of its legacy, [...] "Thriller had extramusical help in becoming the best-selling noncompilation album of all time: Jackson's dancing feet and dazzling stage presence, amplified by the newfound promotional reach of music video and <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>era's</b> embrace of glossy celebrity.
