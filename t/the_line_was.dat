5|$|Nordberg station {{opened on}} 10 October 1934 as a {{station on the}} Sognsvann Line. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> built by the municipally owned company Akersbanerne. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> double-tracked from Majorstuen to Korsvoll, and single-tracked from there to Sognsvann. In 1939, the section Korsvoll–Sognsvann was {{upgraded}} to double track, and the station Korsvoll had its name changed to Østhorn.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{promoted}} by the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood Railway (C), which was incorporated in 1877, but took until 1892 to open {{the first section of}} the line to Hope Mill. Services were worked by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> extended to Hawkhurst in 1893. In 1900, the SECR absorbed the C Sunday services ceased in 1917. In 1923, the SECR was absorbed into the Southern Railway at the Grouping. The line became part of British Railways at Nationalisation on 1 January 1948. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed in June 1961, before the Beeching Report was published.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} proposed {{opening of}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> on 28 October 1850 by Thomas Farncombe, Lord Mayor of London, but <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> far from complete {{by this time}} and so the ceremony was postponed. A second proposed opening date of 1 January 1851 was rejected due to signaling problems.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> quadrupled in 1903. In 1925 <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> electrified.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 12.5 km {{long and}} has a rail gauge of [...] The first 5.5 km of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{operated}} by conventional rail adhesion. The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> operated as a rack railway, using the Abt system and with a maximum gradient of 15%. In total <b>the</b> <b>line</b> overcomes a height difference of 1062 m. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> electrified with an overhead supply at 1500 V DC.|$|R
5|$|A half-way line, {{parallel}} to the back line, divides the pitch in two. The start of each period of play and resumption of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> also used for the obselete offside rule.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} to Nesttun, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> exteneded southwards to Rådal at Lagunen Storsenter. Construction began in January 2011, {{on its own}} right-of-way parallel to the existing road;, the track was completed in October 2012. The first test run to Lagunen was conducted on 6 December 2012, and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{opened to the public}} on 22 June 2013.|$|E
5|$|By 2008, the Line 2 {{terminated}} at the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park station. On February 24, 2010, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{expanded from}} this station through the Jinke Road station to the Guanglan Road station. Two months later, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> extended past the station through the Tangzhen, Middle Chuangxin Road, East Huaxia Road, Chuansha, Lingkong Road, Yuandong Avenue, and Haitiansan Road stations to the Pudong Airport station, which serves the Shanghai Pudong International Airport.|$|E
30|$|In this region, {{you have}} an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart next to an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together. When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together, <b>the</b> 3 D shape of the terrain is steep, and changes quickly (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES).

5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public {{transport}} station on 1 February 1923, when the then single-track Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt to double track. From 19 December 1939, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built with double track. In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts {{at both ends of the}} square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not all at the same time. At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway {{began in}} 1845. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> opened in October 1849, with {{services}} from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it {{became one of}} Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500V DC overhead line. At {{the same time a}} new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Adelaide network, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> broad gauge. Dual gauge {{sleepers}} have been laid to allow for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to <b>be</b> converted to standard gauge at a future date. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 35.9 kilometres long and is the second longest of the Adelaide suburban railway <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> double track throughout.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{single track}} from Woodville to Grange with no passing loops over its entire length. All {{stations}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>are</b> unattended and have only very basic passenger waiting facilities. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 5.5 kilometres long and broad gauge (1600mm).|$|R
30|$|In this region, {{you have}} an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart next to an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together. When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together, <b>the</b> {{elevation}} is changing quickly, meaning the region has a steep slope (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES). When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart, <b>the</b> elevation is changing slowly, meaning the region has a shallow slope (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES).|$|R
5|$|Further {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> limited {{by a lack}} of funds. Russell asked the LNWR to adopt the line in August 1865, to no avail. An Act of 1866 gave permission to raise a further £20,000, with loans of £6,600. After raising this capital, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> opened to Llanerchymedd in 1866, with the temporary station at Llangefni replaced by a permanent structure half a mile further on. Captain Rich, when surveying the line, noted that the curves and gradients were severe, and recommended that the line be worked at moderate speed. He also noted the lack of turntables, and the company's intention to use Fairlie engines on the line.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{decision}} was taken to electrify the railway using power generated from the hospital's own power plant, which was also connected to the National Grid. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> electrified at 500V DC using a single overhead line.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a railway}} was {{authorised}} {{to be built}} from Robertsbridge to Pevensey, East Sussex. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> authorised under the Light Railways Act 1896, but was not constructed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> not electrified, and {{services}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>are</b> operated by KiHa 40 series {{diesel multiple unit}} (DMU) trains.|$|R
50|$|Today <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> main <b>line</b> between Dresden and Cottbus. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{served by}} Regional-Express {{services}} on the Dresden-Cottbus, Dresden-Hoyerswerda and Cottbus-Falkenberg/Elster routes.|$|R
50|$|Today <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> {{accessible}} {{for most of}} their length, but overgrown and derelict in places. The moat is used for fishing. In May 2006 the moat experienced some flooding. Most of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> designated as a scheduled ancient monument. In 2010 <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> given a Green Flag Award.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, the Sognsvann Line {{was closed}} {{during the summer}} {{vacations}} due to improvements of the track and third rail. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed for approximately one week, due to leaves that had covered the tracks. The operation of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> replaced by buses that served temporary stops in Nordbergveien and Sognsveien. In 2010, a truck was stuck under the train bridge between Holstein and Kringsjå over Carl Kjeldsens vei. The bridge was damaged, and allowed for only one-way-traffic for two weeks. Half the trains had to stop at Berg in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Irwin was {{appointed}} ambassador for The Ghan, the passenger train running from Adelaide to Alice Springs {{in the central}} Australian outback, when <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> extended {{all the way to}} Darwin on the northern coast that year. For some time he was sponsored by Toyota.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012, Network Rail {{appointed}} BAM Nuttall as {{its main}} contractor. The Network Rail team which worked on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{essentially the same}} as the one which delivered the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in 2009. A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E
