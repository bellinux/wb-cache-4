5|$|Apaches shunned <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> <b>and</b> on March 16, 1758, {{a band of}} Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes, {{angry that}} the Spaniards were {{assisting}} their enemies, pillaged and burned the mission, killing eight people. The San Sabá mission was the only Spanish mission in Texas to be completely destroyed by Indians, and it was never rebuilt. Although the Indian force had 2000members, they chose not to attack the fort.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E

50|$|The Isleños had {{no access}} to water from the San Antonio River for irrigating the land they farmed, as it was {{reserved}} for use by <b>the</b> <b>missions.</b> <b>The</b> stream of San Pedro had {{been used by the}} Canarians of San Antonio since their arrival, but in 1732 the Cabildo wrote to the Viceroy stating that the volume of water was not enough to irrigate their fields and their crops were dying. In response, the Viceroy suggested in his order that the waters of San Antonio be divided proportionately between <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> settlers. An official inspection found that the water flow was plentiful enough to supply <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> villa. The tension between <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> settlers continued for some time, and later focused on land grant issues as well as irrigation.|$|R
5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote in his report that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> apparently feared that it had uncovered information they would have preferred to conceal. He argued that there were Slovene populations in Styria who would have preferred the maintenance of Austrian rule.|$|E
5|$|The crew's {{preparation}} for the mission had begun some thirteen months earlier in 1994, with the crew being trained {{in the operation of}} the space shuttle, the mating and docking procedures that would be required as Atlantis approached Mir later in <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> <b>and</b> the management of the various scientific experiments being carried on the orbiter during the mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} greatly disturbed Russian and British {{influence in}} Central and South Asia, raising {{concerns about the}} security of their interests in the region.

5|$|Cochrane {{had several}} {{disputes}} with San Martín. He discussed {{several of his}} actions and tried to bypass his authority. During the blockade of El Callao, he proposed that O'Higgins take control of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> send any spoils of battle to Chile. As San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Martín was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Martín in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Each {{mission has}} a timed {{duration}} that the player must beat, with two tiers of time bonus. The player is rewarded with space credits {{dependent on the}} amount of cargo that survived <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> how quickly they completed it. Reputation, displayed as stars, is rewarded based whether or not the player met cargo or time thresholds. Space credits are used between missions in order to purchase special abilities and bonuses for modules, while gaining reputation unlocks new modules.|$|E

5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> <b>and</b> the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E
5|$|Grissom's crew {{received}} {{approval in}} June 1966 {{to design a}} mission patch with the name Apollo 1.

With the battle over, Artanis asked the purifiers to join the Daelaam in the war against Amon.

5|$|Misperceptions of the Dixie Mission {{contributed to}} the {{nationwide}} Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s. Thawing relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in the 1970s opened a new chapter for the mission. For the first time, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> its participants {{became the subject of}} serious scholarship, and many of the mission participants were among the first Americans invited to visit China in twenty years. In China, the Dixie Mission is remembered as a positive time between the two nations, and a symbol of Sino-American cooperation.|$|E

5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was {{to retrieve it}} using a space shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} two themes: morality and the UN effectiveness. Off characterized Dallaire and Arbour as morally correct and MacKenzie morally wrong.

In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son's commander but would want Dallaire if her people were being attacked because one puts his soldiers before <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> the other the mission before the soldiers.|$|E
