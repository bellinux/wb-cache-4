I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E

I really do believe I can break a record, or come close to it, or win a medal." [...] He is frequently described as a modest and respectful athlete.|$|E

Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season. White said, [...] "Stephen outplayed me in safety, potting and position so he deserved to win" [...] and, [...] "He gave me a good bashing. I'm pleased for him because he's a nice lad but I'm disappointed because I didn't compete".|$|E

In a 1984 oral history interview, he recalled the process: [...] "he difficulty is {{in such a short}} melody, I have to put in all the words.... t must be very simple, understandable for all the races in Singapore.... I consult also [...] an author in Malay language so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it in proper Malay language but not too deep and not too difficult." [...] Summing up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb [...] "Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung" [...] ("You should hold up the sky of the land where you live").|$|E
500|$|Fields {{had come}} [...] "up from the cutting room floor" [...] {{and out of}} the customary, near-anonymity of film editors. Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong to them, and they feel a certain resentment - that I went to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In the movie business, as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This is a fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Saunderson {{has also}} {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} Europe but {{he claims to have}} been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment: [...] "I was more infatuated with the idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> this all myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 1, 1995, at the Patinoire Auditorium in Lausanne, Switzerland, Berry {{collapsed}} on stage during an R.E.M. show from a ruptured brain aneurysm. He recovered and rejoined the band, but left in October 1997, {{saying that he}} no longer had the drive or enjoyment level to be in the band, and that he wanted a career change. He later explained on VH-1's Behind The Music: I didn't wake up one day and decide, 'I just can't stand these guys anymore' or anything. I feel like I'm ready for a life change. I'm still young enough <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> something else. I've been pounding the tubs since I was nine years old ... I'm ready to do something else.|$|E

2500|$|Gupta {{describes}} the letter written by Tagore as [...] "historic". He writes that Tagore [...] "renounced his knighthood in {{protest against the}} inhuman cruelty of the British Government {{to the people of}} Punjab", and he quotes Tagore's letter to the Viceroy [...] "The enormity of the measures taken by the Government in the Punjab for quelling some local disturbances has, with a rude shock, revealed to our minds the helplessness of our position as British subjects in India ... he very least <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for my country is to take all consequences upon myself in giving voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised into a dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation..." [...] English Writings of Rabindranath Tagore Miscellaneous Writings Vol# 8 carries a facsimile of this hand written letter.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{reference}} to this circuit board fragment was on September 15, 1989, when Alan Feraday of DERA sent a Polaroid photograph {{of it to}} the police officer leading the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector William Williamson, asking for help in identification and with a covering note saying this was [...] "the best <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> in such a short time". In June 1990, Feraday and DCI Williamson were said to have visited FBI headquarters in Washington and, together with Thomas Thurman, an FBI explosives expert, identified the fragment as coming from a type of timer circuit board similar to the one in the timer that had been seized from a Libyan intelligence agent, Mohammad al-Marzouk, who had been arrested in Dakar airport, Senegal ten months before PA 103 (The Independent, December 19, 1990). Marzouk was found to be carrying [...] of Semtex, several packets of TNT, 10 detonators, and an electronic timer—a so-called MST-13 timer—with the word Mebo printed on it. DERA's timer fragment, which was subsequently designated as PT/35(b), would eventually lead detectives via its Swiss manufacturer to Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.|$|E

2500|$|For {{people with}} incomes above $250,000, Obama wants {{to reduce their}} {{charitable}} tax deduction from 35 cents for each dollar donated to 28 cents for each dollar donated, to match the level of deductions for people making less than $250,000. In a press conference on March 24, 2009, Obama stated {{that he wanted to}} return to the rate that existed in the Reagan administration. [...] "There's very little evidence that this has a significant impact on charitable giving," [...] said Obama. [...] "I'll tell you what has a significant impact on charitable giving, is a financial crisis and an economy that's contracting. And so the most important thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for charitable giving is to fix the economy, to get banks lending again, to get businesses opening their doors again, to get people back to work again." [...] Thomas L. Hungerford of the Congressional Research Service has written that [...] "allowing the tax cuts targeted to high income taxpayers to expire as scheduled could help reduce budget deficits in the short-term without stifling the economic recovery." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Whig grandees such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately {{agreed with}} Burke's Appeal, they {{wished he had}} used more {{moderate}} language. Fitzwilliam saw the Appeal as containing [...] "the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since". Francis Basset, a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: [...] "...though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox & from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution". Burke sent {{a copy of the}} Appeal to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it [...] "with great Satisfaction". Burke wrote of its reception: [...] "Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> myself justice". Charles Burney viewed it as [...] "a most admirable book—the best & most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen" [...] but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.|$|E
2500|$|It {{had come}} at a bad time, as his {{favourite}} retreat at Moor Spa was threatened by Lane being put on trial accused of adultery, and five days later Darwin's baby Charles Waring came down with scarlet fever. Darwin's first impression had been that though it meant losing priority, it would be dishonourable {{for him to be}} [...] "induced to publish from privately knowing that Wallace is in the field", but Lyell quickly responded strongly urging him to reconsider. Darwin's reply of 25 June was a plea for advice, noting that the points in Wallace's sketch had been fully covered in his own Essay of 1844 which Hooker had read in 1847, and that he had also set out his ideas in a letter to Asa Gray in 1857, [...] "so that I could most truly say and prove that I take nothing from Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my general views in about a dozen pages or so. But I cannot persuade myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so honourably... I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit". He added a request that Hooker be informed to give a second opinion.|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Wicked, she recorded material with Brian May for her debut album and performed at various live events including her {{first set of}} solo musical showcase concerts entitled Kerry Ellis Sings the Great British Songbook at the Shaw Theatre on Euston Road in London. She performed on four dates in late June 2009 with the inclusion of Brian May in each night's encore. Of the concerts, Ellis commented, [...] "It's finally something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> as me, {{as opposed to being}} in a show as a character. It's lovely to be able to sing songs that I really want to sing or which I wouldn't normally get to sing." [...] The showcase paid tribute to some of Ellis' favourite British composers and lyricists including Take That, Duffy, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney. Of her [...] "eclectic set" [...] with [...] "velvety rich distinctive vocals," [...] a critic professed, [...] "Ellis is as sexy as any other female pop star out there today and she sings like a true diva," [...] and concluded, [...] "She may have left Oz for good but there is no place like home and for Kerry Ellis that home is most definitely the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
