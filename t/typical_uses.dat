5|$|Nonmetals do {{not have}} any {{universal}} or near-universal applications. This is not the case with metals, most of which have structural uses; nor the metalloids, the <b>typical</b> <b>uses</b> of which extend to (for example) oxide glasses, alloying components, and semiconductors.|$|E
5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. <b>Typical</b> <b>uses</b> of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E
25|$|<b>Typical</b> <b>uses</b> {{are for the}} shackle of a lock, {{where the}} outer layer is {{hardened}} to be file resistant, and mechanical gears, where hard gear mesh surfaces are needed to maintain a long service life while toughness is required to maintain durability and resistance to catastrophic failure.|$|E

In another <b>typical</b> <b>use,</b> magazines include subscription cards that potential subscribers can return by freepost. In yet another <b>typical</b> <b>use,</b> a seller can provide a merchandise return label bearing the appropriate freepost indicia (as described below) to a customer so that the customer can return the item to the seller by freepost upon issuance of a Return Merchandise Authorization.|$|R

25|$|These {{thermocouples}} {{are well}} suited for measuring extremely high temperatures. <b>Typical</b> <b>uses</b> are hydrogen and inert atmospheres, as well as vacuum furnaces. They are not used in oxidizing environments at high temperatures because of embrittlement. A typical range is 0 to 2315°C, which can be extended to 2760°C in inert atmosphere and to 3000°C for brief measurements.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{business}} world, word processors are extremely useful tools. Some <b>typical</b> <b>uses</b> include: creating legal documents, company reports, publications for clients, letters, and internal memos. Businesses {{tend to have}} their own format and style for any of these, and additions such as company letterhead. Thus, modern word processors with layout editing and similar capabilities find widespread use in most business.|$|E
25|$|A {{parabolic}} microphone uses a {{parabolic reflector}} {{to collect and}} focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, {{in much the same}} way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. <b>Typical</b> <b>uses</b> of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.|$|E

25|$|Assembly {{languages}} eliminate {{much of the}} error-prone, tedious, {{and time-consuming}} first-generation programming needed with the earliest computers, freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses. They were once widely used {{for all sorts of}} programming. However, by the 1980s (1990s on microcomputers), their use had largely been supplanted by higher-level languages, in the search for improved programming productivity. Today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues. <b>Typical</b> <b>uses</b> are device drivers, low-level embedded systems, and real-time systems.|$|E
25|$|Typically in {{developed}} countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though {{only a small}} proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. Other <b>typical</b> <b>uses</b> include washing, toilets, and irrigation. Greywater may {{also be used for}} toilets or irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with risks. Water may also be unacceptable due to levels of toxins or suspended solids. Reduction of waterborne diseases and development of safe water resources is a major public health goal in developing countries. Bottled water is sold for public consumption {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The {{deletion}} {{of parts}} on a vehicle {{is an easy}} way for designers and vehicle owners to reduce parasitic and frontal drag of the vehicle with little cost and effort. Deletion {{can be as simple}} as removing an aftermarket part, or part that has been installed on the vehicle after production, or having to modify and remove an OEM part, meaning any part of the vehicle that was originally manufactured on the vehicle. Most production sports cars and high efficiency vehicles come standard with many of these deletions in order to be competitive in the automotive and race market, while others choose to keep these drag-increasing aspects of the vehicle for their visual aspects, or to fit the <b>typical</b> <b>uses</b> of their customer base.|$|E

25|$|The generations who led {{and fought}} the American Civil War were born into an {{independent}} United States {{and they would}} determine whether it could continue as a united republic. Steam power on land and sea had begun to shrink {{the world and the}} telegraph moved information at the speed of electricity. In 1851, Congress reduced rates for <b>typical</b> <b>uses</b> such as printed matter to one cent, and three-cent letter postage versus five or ten-cent rates. Postal distances for each rate were extended as much as ten times, for example, from three hundred to 3,000 miles. Their world was filled with mechanized innovations that included the first U.S. postage stamps produced from machine perforation to replace the cutting tasks which had been done manually. These were accompanied by innovations in paper types and printing techniques.|$|E

2500|$|A {{police car}} (also called a police cruiser, cop car, prowler, squad car, radio car or radio mobile patrol (RMP) [...] ) is a ground vehicle used by police for {{transportation}} during patrols and {{to enable them}} to respond to incidents. <b>Typical</b> <b>uses</b> of a police car include transporting officers so they can reach the scene of an incident quickly, transporting and temporarily detaining suspects in the back seats, as a location to use their police radio or laptop or to patrol an area, all while providing a visible deterrent to crime. Some police cars are specially adapted for certain locations (e.g. traffic duty on busy roads) or for certain operations (e.g. to transport police dogs or bomb squads). Police cars typically have rooftop flashing lights, a siren, and emblems or markings indicating that the vehicle is a police car. Some police cars may have reinforced bumpers and alley lights, for illuminating darkened alleys.|$|E
