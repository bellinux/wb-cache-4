25|$|The JWST has {{a history}} of major cost overruns and delays which have {{resulted}} from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. The first budget estimates were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011, but NASA has now scheduled the telescope for a 2019 launch on a budget <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> to $8.8 billion. In 2011, the United States House of Representatives voted to terminate funding, after about $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. Funding was restored and capped at $8 billion. , the telescope remained on schedule for a spring 2019 launch and within the 2011 revised budget.

25|$|Circumvention {{tourism is}} also an area of medical tourism <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown.</b> Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical {{services}} that are legal in the destination country but illegal in the home country. This can include travel for fertility treatments that aren’t yet approved in the home country, abortion, and doctor-assisted suicide. Abortion tourism can be found most commonly in Europe, where travel between countries is relatively simple. Ireland and Poland, two European countries with highly restrictive abortion laws, have {{the highest rates of}} circumvention tourism. In Poland especially, it is estimated that each year nearly 7,000 women travel to the UK, where abortion services are free through the National Health Service. There are also efforts being made by independent organizations and doctors, such as with Women on Waves, to help women circumvent draconian laws in order to access medical services. With Women on Waves, the organization uses a mobile clinic aboard a ship to provide medical abortions in international waters, where the law of the country whose flag is flown applies.|$|E
25|$|Equatorial Guinea is {{considered}} wealthy by African standards, with a GDP that routinely outperforms neighboring African nations, {{in most instances}} by over 300 percent, and <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> steadily in recent years. Indeed, its per capital GDP now exceeds those of Italy, Israel, and South Korea. But thanks to the massive diversion of funds from the national treasury into the Nguema/Mongomo group's bank accounts, the people of Equatorial Guinea live in desperate poverty, with over 60% earning less than $1 a day. Life expectancy is below 50, 57% of the people lack clean drinking water, 47% lack safe plumbing, {{and the level of}} medical care is primitive. The country has the world's fourth-highest infant mortality rate. Many of these kinds of indicators have gone from bad to worse in recent years. A 2009 UNDP report found that the difference between Equatorial Guinea's per capita GDP rank and its HDI (Human Development Index) rank was the world's highest, implying that Equatorial Guinea is the worst governed country on the planet.|$|E

25|$|Extensive {{soil erosion}} and {{landslides}} in its upper catchment {{have produced a}} silt yield of about 19m3/ha/year (10cuyd/acre/yr), {{one of the highest}} in the world. Of major tributaries, the Arun brings the greatest amount of coarse silt in proportion to its total sediment load. The river transports sediment down the steep gradients and narrow gorges in the mountains and foothills where the gradient is at least ten metres per km. On the plains beyond Chatra, the gradient falls below one metre per km to as little as 6cm per km as the river approaches the Ganges. Current slows and the sediment load settles {{out of the water and}} is deposited on an immense alluvial fan <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> to an area of about 15000km2. This fan extends some 180km from its apex where it leaves the foothills, across the international border into Bihar state and on to the Ganges. The river has numerous interlacing channels that shift laterally over the fan from time to time. Without channelisation, floods spread out very widely. The record flow of 24200m3/s is equivalent to water a metre deep and more than 24km wide, flowing at one metre per second.|$|E
