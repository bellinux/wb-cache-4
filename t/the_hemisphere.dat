5|$|Closer to home, Cleveland {{adopted a}} broad {{interpretation}} of the Monroe Doctrine that not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within <b>the</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested. British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the American government, having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded {{the bulk of the}} disputed territory to British Guiana. But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with the United States' southern neighbors, and at the same time, the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most {{prominent}} features are a large (400km diameter) impact crater named Odysseus on its leading hemisphere and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on <b>the</b> <b>hemisphere</b> opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus. The density of Tethys (0.985g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with {{only a small fraction of}} rock.|$|E
5|$|The cratered terrain, {{a rolling}} surface covered by {{numerous}} impact craters and centered on Ariel's south pole, is the moon's {{oldest and most}} geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (graben), and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel's mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as chasmata, probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting, which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon's interior (see below). They are 15–50km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. The floors of many canyons are convex; rising up by 1–2km. Sometimes the floors are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1km wide. The widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called valles. The longest canyon is Kachina Chasma, at over 620km in length (the feature extends into <b>the</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of Ariel that Voyager 2 did not see illuminated).|$|E
5000|$|The summer {{solstice}} occurs during <b>the</b> <b>hemisphere's</b> summer. [...] This is the northern solstice in <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> and <b>the</b> southern solstice in <b>the</b> Southern <b>Hemisphere.</b> Depending on <b>the</b> {{shift of the}} calendar, the {{summer solstice}} occurs some time between June 20 and June 22 in <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> and between December 20 and December 23 each year in <b>the</b> Southern <b>Hemisphere.</b> <b>The</b> same dates in <b>the</b> opposite <b>hemisphere</b> {{are referred to as}} the winter solstice.|$|R
50|$|Experiments on covert {{orienting}} {{of spatial}} attention using the Posner paradigm confirm {{the existence of}} two different attentional systems in <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres.</b> <b>The</b> right <b>hemisphere</b> was found superior to <b>the</b> left <b>hemisphere</b> on modified versions of spatial relations tests and in locations testing, whereas <b>the</b> left <b>hemisphere</b> was more object based. The components of mental imagery are differentially specialized: <b>the</b> right <b>hemisphere</b> was found superior for mental rotation, <b>the</b> left <b>hemisphere</b> superior for image generation. It was also found that <b>the</b> right <b>hemisphere</b> {{paid more attention to}} landmarks and scenes whereas <b>the</b> left <b>hemisphere</b> paid more attention to exemplars of categories.|$|R
5000|$|When {{viewed from}} <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere,</b> <b>the</b> Moon appears {{inverted}} {{compared to a}} view from <b>the</b> Southern <b>Hemisphere.</b> <b>The</b> North Pole faces away from the galactic center of the Milky Way. This results in the Milky Way being sparser and dimmer in <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> compared to <b>the</b> Southern <b>Hemisphere,</b> making <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> more suitable for deep-space observation, as it is not [...] "blinded" [...] by the Milky Way.|$|R
5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over <b>the</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|Treviño Morales {{reportedly}} coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, {{including the}} murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. He is also believed to have threatened to shoot down {{the plane of the}} former President Felipe Calderón in August 2012 while on a trip to the state of Tamaulipas. Although it {{was not the first time}} Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to be highly sophisticated, advanced, and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and <b>the</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> He was widely regarded as one of the most violent drug lords operating in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The band Pylon was {{a long-standing}} and {{influential}} {{part of the}} Athens scene, and became critical darlings in the 1980s, but never achieved significant mainstream success. This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels {{due to a lack}} of trust in their corporate goodwill. Pylon's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial, and was accompanied grating, chanting-style vocals, funky guitars and bass-heavy beats. Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included Love Tractor, Oh-OK, with Michael Stipe's sister Lynda Stipe, vocalist Linda Hopper (later of Magnapop) and future solo performer Matthew Sweet, Dreams So Real. The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars, helping out local performers like Vic Chesnutt, the Chickasaw Mudd Puppies and Jack Logan. The Elephant 6 Collective, a group of like-minded indie bands, gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid-1990s with the rise of Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and Olivia Tremor Control. The same period saw the Kindercore Records roster find critical acclaim, including the bands Sunshine Fix, Masters of <b>the</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> Japancakes, Love Tractor, Gresham Disco and Of Montreal. Candy, a DJ store owned by Michael Lachowski of Pylon, opened in 1998; the store became an important part of the burgeoning dance music scene that produced Danger Mouse, Phungus and DJ 43.|$|E

500|$|Because of the Coriolis effect, {{the wind}} flow {{around a large}} cyclone is {{counterclockwise}} in <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> and clockwise in <b>the</b> Southern <b>Hemisphere.</b> In <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere,</b> <b>the</b> fastest winds relative {{to the surface of}} the [...] Earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward-moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward-moving one; the opposite occurs in <b>the</b> Southern <b>Hemisphere.</b> [...] In contrast to low pressure systems, the wind flow around high pressure systems are clockwise (anticyclonic) in <b>the</b> northern <b>hemisphere,</b> and counterclockwise in <b>the</b> southern <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>hemisphere</b> <b>the</b> Right Ascension scale {{operates in}} reverse from in <b>the</b> Northern <b>Hemisphere.</b> <b>The</b> term Right Ascension took {{its name from}} early northern hemisphere observers for whom [...] "ascending stars" [...] were on the east or right hand side.

40|$|By {{introducing}} an asymmetry between <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres,</b> {{we study}} whether the solar dynamo solutions in <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres</b> remain coupled with each other. Our calculations {{are based on}} the solar dynamo code SURYA, which incorporates the helioseismically-determined solar-rotation profile, a Babcock–Leighton α effect concentrated near the surface, and a meridional circulation. When the magnetic coupling between <b>the</b> <b>hemispheres</b> is enhanced by either increasing the diffusion or introducing an α effect distributed throughout the convection zone, we find that the solutions in <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres</b> evolve together with a single period even when we make the meridional circulation or the α effect different in <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, when the hemispheric coupling is weaker for other values of parameters, an asymmetry between <b>the</b> <b>hemispheres</b> can make solutions in <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres</b> evolve independently with different periods...|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} an aurora in <b>the</b> dark <b>hemisphere</b> and <b>the</b> magnetic fields in <b>the</b> sunlit <b>hemisphere</b> by {{taking advantage of}} the measurements in each <b>hemisphere.</b> <b>The</b> consistency of the initiation times of the PI and MI signals around the conjugate points suggests that the interhemispheric comparison is reasonable. It should be noted, however, that ground magnetic field responses to SCs in <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres</b> are not <b>the</b> same. The PI magnitude is larger in <b>the</b> sunlit <b>hemisphere</b> (Sastri et al. 2008), and the current pattern may be different (Kim et al. 2013). Although the present study does not compare the current distribution or intensity in <b>the</b> two <b>hemispheres,</b> <b>the</b> auroral brightening locations and intensity in <b>the</b> sunlit <b>hemisphere</b> could be different from the measurements in <b>the</b> dark <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|R
