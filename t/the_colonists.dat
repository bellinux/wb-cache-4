Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil.

Although Beaujeu delivered a message from La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having made peace with Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from dysentery and venereal diseases, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{long-term}} developments in population biology and life history during the invasion and {{establishment of the}} fish species vendace Coregonus albula in a subarctic watercourse by comparing life-history traits and molecular genetic estimates between the source and <b>the</b> <b>colonist</b> population. <b>The</b> two populations exhibited highly contrasting life-history strategies. Relative to the source population, <b>the</b> <b>colonist</b> population was characterized by slower somatic growth rates, earlier sexual maturation at smaller individual size, higher mortality rates and a shorter life span. The two populations could also be significantly discriminated by the genetic markers. Limited founder effects were detected from heterozygote deficit and reduced allelic richness in <b>the</b> <b>colonist</b> population, but both populations were associated with relatively high genetic diversity. The study reveals that the invasion into a new environment induced large changes in life-history strategy, with typical r-selected traits being more prominent in <b>the</b> <b>colonist</b> than in <b>the</b> source population. We discuss the mechanisms that may explain the observed life-history differences between the source and <b>the</b> <b>colonist</b> population, and argue that the accelerated life history of <b>the</b> <b>colonist</b> population represents an adaptive pioneer strategy aimed at fast population increase during colonization and establishment...|$|R

5|$|During the American Revolution, {{the road}} was an {{important}} artery over which the British and <b>the</b> <b>colonists</b> fought.

Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack.

The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to <b>the</b> <b>colonists</b> as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA.

50|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the American colonies, the British Navy protected the developing colonies, and <b>the</b> <b>colonist</b> paid taxes to the crown through import and export tariffs, taxes, and when requested, raised armies for London.
