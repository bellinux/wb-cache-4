In {{the strengthening}} in beams, the <b>tensile</b> <b>zone</b> is found damaged for several reasons (cracking and corrosion, for instance), which demands, {{in the practice of}} engineering, its preliminary retrofitting. It should be considered that the good performance of the material used in this retrofitting is fundamental for a higher efficiency of the strengthening. Therefore, it is proposed a methodology that consists of the reconstitution of the <b>tensile</b> <b>zone</b> of the beams with a cement-based composite of high performance (CCAD), which acts as a substrate for the application of CFRP and as an element for the transfer of efforts to the part strengthened. The retrofitting of this <b>tensile</b> <b>zone</b> was performed only in the shear span, as well as throughout of the zone with a view to evaluating the influence of this aspect on the performance of the beams. The CCAD, produced from Portland cement, steel fibers and microfibers, was evaluated using the Rilem (2002), showed to be able to delay the cracking.

30|$|As can be {{observed}} in Fig. 4, the final subsidence basin can be roughly divided into three zones, including the central zone, the compressive zone, and the <b>tensile</b> <b>zone.</b> In the central zone, the subsidence is uniformly distributed, and can achieve the maximum value, while in contrast the horizontal displacement is quite small. The compressive zone is the region that is located between the boundary of the subsidence basin and the central zone, in which the subsidence is not uniformly distributed and compression arise due to the falling rock or soil body. The <b>tensile</b> <b>zone</b> is located on the boundary of the subsidence basin, in which the subsidence gradually reduced to zero; and tensile deformation always is produced due to the horizontal surface displacement that moves towards the center of the subsidence basin.|$|E

40|$|When high {{strength}} steel is used as reinforcement in lightweight concrete members, great economies can be achieved. However, because lightweight concrete has low tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, the working steel stresses hoped for may not be fully utilised due to the limit states of serviceability (cracking and deflection) not being satisfied. To control the amount of cracking and deflection in flexural concrete members, {{a new type of}} construction has been employed, whereby precast fibre reinforced cement (f. r. c) units in the form of thin channels are used as a surface reinforcement at the flexural <b>tensile</b> <b>zone</b> of the concrete members. The concrete in the <b>tensile</b> <b>zone,</b> confined by the f. r. c channel, will have a greater resistance to formation and extension of crack; consequently the rate of reduction in the flexural rigidity of the member will be decreased. A total of 27 ordinary reinforced and fibre reinforced cement composite lightweight concrete beams, 150 mm wide, 300 mm deep and 5 m long were tested, 18 under static load test, 5 under fatigue load test and 4 under sustained load test. The composite beams were similar to the ordinary beams in every respect, except that f. r. c. channels (150 mm width, 60 mm length of upstands and 6 mm thickness) were incorporated as integral parts on their flexural tensile sides.

One thousand virtual GLT beams were generated with the E 8 lamina grade of 38  mm[*]×[*] 89  mm lamina stock from the input database (see Fig.  11 c). The bending test results of the actual GLT beams show that 12 specimens failed around finger joints and 18 specimens failed around the knot.

40|$|Internal {{erosion and}} piping {{is the cause}} of about half of large {{embankment}} dam failures. Most internal erosion and piping failures occur due to concentrated leak erosion which is initiated by a crack in an embankment or its foundation. Differential settlements occur due to the variations in the height of the embankment across the valley in which the dam is constructed. This can lead to low stress and <b>tensile</b> strain <b>zones</b> in which cracks may form. This paper presents two dimensional numerical analyses of the deformations and stresses in the cross valley profile during construction, and assesses the potential cracking zones.

It is shown that tensile and low stress zones form at the crest of the dam near the abutments, and large <b>tensile</b> strain <b>zones</b> may occur over discontinuities and irregularities in the cross valley profile.

Four TDR cables were installed in drill holes near the monitoring stations in the landslide area. According to the recorded TDR waveforms, there were shear and <b>tensile</b> <b>zones</b> under the B- 5, B- 9, C- 1, and C- 2 stations.

40|$|Optimisation of {{performance}} and reduction of costs of structures are major issues in engineering. However, this optimisation requires very accurate numerical models to predict the behaviour of the structures that are currently not available for concrete structures after they start cracking. Since concrete may develop cracks, which contradict the classical solid mechanics assumption of a continuum, the results obtained are in general not satisfactory. The classical theory of solid mechanics is formulated in terms of differential equations relying on the basic assumption of material continuity that {{does not exist in}} the cracked material. The presented model is based on the existing peridynamics theory which describes the mechanics of materials by employing integral equations, which are valid during cracking. The discretization of the structure in a set of material particles, correspondent interactions and an explicit scheme of integration based on Verlet method are described. Cracks can form by the breaking of interparticle bonds. The capacity of the model to predict the development of discrete cracks in <b>tensile</b> <b>zones</b> was verified with simple numerical tests. This work can provide the basis for more accurate strategies of predicting concrete structures and similar materials behaviour. The main consequences would be the reduction environmental impacts, cost of construction and also the development of new architectonic concepts along with developments in other industries...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe massive {{cracking}} {{of silicon}} thin film electrodes in lithium ion batteries {{is associated with}} the colossal volume changes that occur during lithiation and delithiation cycles. However, the underlying cracking mechanism or even whether fracture initiates during lithiation or delithiation is still unknown. Here, we model the stress generation in amorphous silicon thin films during lithium insertion, fully accounting for the effects of finite strains, plastic flow, and pressure-gradients on the diffusion of lithium. Our finite element analyses demonstrate that the fracture of lithiated silicon films occurs by a sequential cracking mechanism which is distinct from fracture induced by residual tension in conventional thin films. During early-stage lithiation, the expansion of the lithium-silicon subsurface layer bends the film near the edges, and generates a high <b>tensile</b> stress <b>zone</b> at a critical distance away within the lithium-free silicon. Fracture initiates at this high tension zone and creates new film edges, which in turn bend and generate high tensile stresses a further critical distance away. Under repeated lithiation and delithiation cycles, this sequential cracking mechanism creates silicon islands of uniform diameter, which scales with the film thickness. The predicted island sizes, as well as the abrupt mitigation of fracture below a critical film thickness due to the diminishing <b>tensile</b> stress <b>zone,</b> is quantitatively in good agreement with experiments...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the massive}} use of {{concrete}} by the construction industry, its optimisation remains a scientific and engineering challenge, that {{has important implications}} for the global environ and economy. Difficulties predicting the material behaviour after cracking are part of the problem, since design relies on accurate models. As the cracks start to grow, the hypothesis of material continuity that is critical to the differential equations of the classical theory becomes obsolete. In fact, many issues are documented in the literature regarding the employment of the classical continuum solid mechanics and the finite element method in this context. In order to avoid these problems, the recent peridynamics theory [1] was formulated without differential equations or continuity requirement. This contribution describes a numerical method to solve the peridynamics equations using a simple explicit scheme based on the Euler method [2], where the spatial discretisation consists of a finite set of material particles and interparticle bonds. Cracks may develop by disruption of these interparticle bonds. The onset and evolution of discrete cracks in <b>tensile</b> <b>zones</b> is predicted in this paper using simple examples. The formulation of the method, comparison with the elastic theory and derivation of relations between model parameters and macroscopic elastic modulus are presented. Furthermore, an initial investigation of the model’s ability to reproduce damage through the spontaneous formation of cracks during loading is analysed. The obtained results, may improve the models used to describe concrete structures and materials vulnerable to cracking. Those improved models, may lead to higher construction quality and mitigation of environmental issues...|$|R
