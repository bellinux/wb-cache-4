5|$|Prior {{to modern}} times, horse breeds {{throughout}} Europe were known {{primarily by the}} name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses of distinct quality that came from Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same breed, and the only difference is the country in which individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse.|$|E
5|$|San {{hunter and}} gatherers, {{ancestors}} of the Khoisani peoples, were the first known inhabitants of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated there across the Zambezi River. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the Mozambican coastline. Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa. Slavery and gold became profitable for the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers {{and there was no}} centralised administration and, in the meantime, Portugal had turned her attention to India and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The final treaty also voided Spanish {{guarantees}} of military support that colonial officials {{had made to}} Native Americans in the disputed regions, greatly weakening those communities’ ability to resist encroachment upon their lands. The treaty represented a major victory for Washington administration, and placated many of the critics of the Jay Treaty. It also enabled and encouraged American settlers to continue their movement west, by making the frontier areas more attractive and lucrative. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> Spain relinquished its claim to through the treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E

5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and within <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland. The game's {{landscape}} includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such as the White House, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington Monument, with a small number of settlements dotted around the Capital Wastelands that consist of descendants of survivors from the Great War, including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb, another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants, and another formed within the hulking remains of an aircraft carrier. While the city can be explored, much of the interior zones are cut off by giant rubble over many of the roads leading in, meaning that access can only be achieved by using the city's former underground metro tunnels (loosely based on the real-life Washington Metro).|$|E
5|$|Having overwintered in Isles, Magnús {{left for}} Norway in the summer, {{only to make}} his return nearly four years later, in 1102 or 1103. Once re-established on Mann, Magnús entered into an {{alliance}} with Ua Briain, formalised through the marriage between Magnús's young son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Ua Briain's daughter, Bjaðmunjo (fl. 1102/1103). Magnús, therefore, appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories. Unfortunately for Ua Briain, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103, whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway. Although Ua Briain was able {{to regain control of}} Dublin, and still held considerable influence in the Isles, Magnús' death appears to have left a power vacuum in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> he was unable to fill.|$|E
5|$|In April 1321 the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in {{south-western}} France) {{landed at}} Thana {{with four other}} friars. He then travelled to Bhatkal in North Canara, a port town on the coastal route from Thana to Quilon. Being the first bishop of India and the Quilon Diocese, he was entrusted the spiritual nourishment of Christian community in Mangalore {{and other parts of}} India by Pope John XXII. According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. It was only after the advent of the Portuguese in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> Christianity began to spread.|$|E

30|$|There {{are also}} sizable {{differences}} in labor market outcomes {{across the two}} groups of <b>regions.</b> For example, <b>the</b> employment rate is 3.11  % higher in <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> opted for own minimum wages. Similarly, the unemployment rate is 3.02  % lower in these regions compared with those that followed the federal minimum wage. The data suggest that own minima were introduced by <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> performed on average better than the others. 13 However, many of the differences across {{the two groups of}} regions are statistically insignificant despite possibly being economically large. This hints at the considerable heterogeneity among <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> within each group.|$|R
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E
5|$|On August12, a {{tropical}} disturbance entered the Caribbean Sea {{to the south}} of Antigua, believed to have been a strong tropical wave. Moving westward, it developed into {{a tropical}} storm by August15, based on ship observations in <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> <b>That</b> day, it passed {{to the south of}} Jamaica and later turned to the northwest. Due to the ongoing War of 1812, there was a British blockade of American ships, which caused a lack of observations in the region. As a result, the storm's track was uncertain, although it is believed that the system entered the Gulf of Mexico by August18; that day, a ship reported hurricane-force winds. After moving northward, the hurricane turned to the northwest off the coast of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Socio-economic {{problems}} of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> {{had not been}} addressed during British Raj continued to linger and were reflected in a representation made to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1947, which highlighted the issues of regional autonomy and Nepali nationality in Darjeeling and adjacent areas. After the independence of India in 1947, Darjeeling was merged {{with the state of}} West Bengal. A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hill towns of Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong and some parts of the Terai region. While the hill population comprised mainly ethnic Nepalis, the plains harboured a large ethnic Bengali population who were refugees from the Partition of India. A cautious and non-receptive response by the West Bengal government to most demands of the ethnic Nepali population led to increased calls, in the 1950s and 1960s, for Darjeeling's autonomy and for the recognition of the Nepali language; the state government acceded to the latter demand in 1961.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System formed 4.568 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Slavonia is {{largely based on}} {{wholesale}} and retail trade and processing industry.

In addition, there are wineries in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> are significant to economy of Croatia. Other types of the processing industry significant to Slavonia are wood processing, including production of furniture, cellulose, paper and cardboard; metalworking, textile industry and glass production. Transport and civil engineering are two further significant economic activities in Slavonia. The largest industrial centre of Slavonia is Osijek, followed by other county seats—Slavonski Brod, Virovitica, Požega and Vukovar, as well as several other cities, especially Vinkovci.|$|E
5|$|The {{only part}} of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>that</b> is {{predominantly}} given over to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land.

Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E
