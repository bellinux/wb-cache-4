5000|$|In telecommunication, {{relative}} <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> is {{the ratio}} of the signal power, at a given point in a transmission system, to a reference signal power.|$|R
5000|$|For example, for a {{composite}} data level of -13 dBm at 0-dBm <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> <b>point</b> (0TLP), the STL would be approximately -25 dBm for a 16-channel VFCT terminal computed from STL = - (13+10log10 n [...] ), where n {{is the number}} of telegraph channels and the STL is in dBm.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio is}} usually {{determined}} by applying a {{standard test tone}} at zero <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> <b>point</b> (or applying adjusted test tone power at any other point) and measuring the gain or loss {{to the location of}} interest. A distinction should be made between the standard test tone power and the expected median power of the actual signal required {{as the basis for the}} design of transmission systems.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Designing {{networks}} for survivability has received considerable attention {{in recent years}} [2, 3, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27]. For ATM-based broadband networks, multi-layer network survivability and restoration can be possible at the following levels: transmission-level, virtual path-level, and virtual circuit or connection/call-level. At <b>transmission</b> <b>level,</b> SONET self-healing ring for restoration is a viable alternative for a major failure such as a fiber cable cut [27]. However, {{it may not be}} possible to provide for such <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> restoration for every type of networks or failures, especially in a wide-area networking environment (e. g. if the network is based on leased capacity from various vendors, all of whom may not have transmission restoration; or, it is not cost-effective to provide adequate transmission network restoration; or, <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> restoration may not be applicable in certain failure scenarios, such as a line card or a de...|$|R
30|$|WAP at the {{distribution}} level {{will depend upon}} similar infrastructure and technology as those systems at the <b>transmission</b> <b>level.</b> However, the smaller angular separation across a distribution network means that measurement of angles on {{the distribution}} network is more demanding than {{it is at the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>level.</b> A particularly important enabler for these new protection principles are micro-processor relays that can vary their settings easily and the IEC 61850 standard will be essential for fully realizing the capabilities of these devices and delivering the protection needs of future distribution systems [62].|$|R
40|$|UV-B {{radiation}} (280 – 315 nm), {{incident on}} the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians growing at Rothera Point on the Western Antarctic Peninsula, was manipulated in late austral spring 1998 by screens {{consisting of a}} novel combination of Plexiglas panes and polyester sheets. The screens transmitted approximately 79, 68, 48, 41 and 31 % of daily UV-B radiation dose. Plants from under and outside the screens were sampled seven times over 35 days. Correlative analyses indicated that concentrations of an anthocyanin-like pigment located in leaf tips were positively associated with UV-B transmission at the last two samplings, that concentrations of total chlorophylls were negatively associated with UV-B transmission at the final sampling, and that those of UV-B screening pigments were positively correlated with transmission at three intermediate samplings. Plants exposed to low UV-B <b>transmission</b> <b>levels</b> were visibly greener than those exposed to high <b>transmission</b> <b>levels</b> after approximately 23 days. The closest relationships between the treatment and concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were associated with increased ambient biologically weighted UV-B dose received by plants in the 5. 5 h before each sampling, which coincided {{with the passage of}} the ozone hole over Rothera Point. As C. varians emerged from melting snow and ice, concentrations of the anthocyanin-like pigment and chlorophyll respectively increased and decreased faster in plants exposed to high <b>transmission</b> <b>levels</b> of UV-B, relative to those exposed to low UV-B <b>transmission</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

40|$|The energy {{turnaround}} {{caused a}} lot of challenges for the power system as well in the distribution level as in the <b>transmission</b> <b>level.</b> For the <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> significant distances between areas of high renewable generation, storage capacities and centers of load require a bulk power transmission. As the existing transmission system is not designed for such tasks, a suitable solution is a meshed HVDC grid spanning the existing AC grid. Most state of the art methodologies for controlling DC node voltages can provoke DC oscillations due to their points of discontinuity. This paper proposed a new continuous local control characteristic and presents a methodology for its parameterization according to available AC balancing control capabilities...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} {{the issues of}} network coding only on the routing layer. So we study the cost of network coding on the <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> and ignore the cost on the coding level, such as {{additional}} coding header or additional computation for network coding.|$|R

Using Moteivs Tmote Sky sensors, we deployed multiHopLQI algorithm of TinyOS in various network configurations: homogeneous and heterogeneous; straight-line and grid topologies with various <b>transmission</b> power <b>levels</b> and distances.

30|$|Higher {{levels of}} {{harmonic}} voltage distortion may be accepted during {{certain parts of}} the year. Its impact on the end-customer is likely to be limited because only a part of the voltage distortion originates from higher voltage levels. Capacitor banks at <b>transmission</b> <b>level</b> may, however, age faster. The overall higher voltage distortion could result in increasing aging for motor loads.|$|R

50|$|MorgenGrauen has {{introduced}} a distinctive level system in May 1996, where the normal fighting experience points became {{only a small part}} of a player character's total level. Since then, PCs get additional <b>level</b> <b>points</b> for solving official and mini-quests, exploring areas, killing strong monsters the first time, guild skills and magic potions. For each 100 <b>level</b> <b>points</b> PCs may advance one level; the current maximum is about level 160. As an example, a high-level player may have about 5% of his points from fighting experience, about 5% from magic potions, 5% from guild skills, 30% from quest points, 20% from first-kill points and 35% from exploring. To prevent making exploring point locations known the <b>level</b> <b>points</b> lacking to the next advance are displayed only as approximate value.|$|R
