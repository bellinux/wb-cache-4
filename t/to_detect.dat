5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E

This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol.

5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment {{and protein}} structure alignment algorithms {{have been developed}} assuming linear data representations and as such are not able <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> circular permutations between proteins. Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models. As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are able <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming.

They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithms}} {{are classified}} {{according to the}} type of input they require. Sequence-based algorithms require only the sequence of two proteins in order to create an alignment. Sequence methods are generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins. Structure-based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered. They are often slower than sequence-based methods, but are able <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity. Some structural methods are topology independent, meaning that they are also able <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> more complex rearrangements than circular permutation.|$|E

40|$|Premenopause is part {{of natural}} aging process in women {{indicated}} by the decrease of ovarial estrogen production, and usually followed by development of menopausal syndrome. Susumeno, skim milk fortified with 100 mg of soy isoflavone and 8 mg of Zn was given to premenopausal women for decreasing menopausal syndrome. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of susumeno on menopausal syndrome in premenopausal women. About 33 premenopausal women aged 43 - 52 years old in Purwokerto were choosen as respondent. Their menopausal syndrome were identified by using questioner. The answers were scored from 1 to 5; i. e., 1 = not detected; 2 = less detected; 3 = mildly detected; 4 = detected; 5 = much detected. It was revealed that some of menopausal syndromes had significantly decreased, especially vaginal dryness from less <b>detected</b> <b>to</b> not <b>detected</b> (p= 0, 01); fatigue from mildly <b>detected</b> <b>to</b> not <b>detected</b> (p= 4, 07 E- 05); mindless from mildly <b>detected</b> <b>to</b> not <b>detected</b> (p= 0, 022); and dyspareunia from less <b>detected</b> <b>to</b> not <b>detected</b> (p= 0, 036...|$|R
