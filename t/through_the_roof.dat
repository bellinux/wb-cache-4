There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{check into}} a motel, where a cow crashes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of Mulder's room. After the incident, a tearful Sheila confesses that the cow {{might have been}} her fault. She admits that she's {{experienced}} a strange history of weather-related phenomena, and believes that she can unconsciously control the weather. Mulder assures her otherwise. During the conversation, Hardt overhears that Mootz was drunk {{the night of the}} accident, and is relieved. Immediately, Mootz's rain powers seem to disappear.|$|E

50|$|Ice dams {{occur on}} heated {{buildings}} with sloping roofs in cold climates with deep snow accumulation. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow forms an insulating layer under cold conditions {{that would cause}} the freezing point to be within the snow layer, {{if it were not}} subject to melting. Instead, building heat coming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof's</b> surface melts <b>the</b> snow resting on it. This causes meltwater to flow down <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> until it reaches below a place on <b>the</b> <b>roof's</b> surface that is below freezing—typically at the eaves where there is no building heat. When the meltwater reaches the frozen surface, ice accumulates, growing a barrier that impedes further passage of meltwater off <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> Ice dams may result in leaks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> material, possibly resulting in damaged ceilings, walls, roof structure and insulation, damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams.|$|R
5|$|Bombs often {{landed on}} the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E

40|$|The {{lightweight}} aluminum standing seam roofing system (LASRS) {{has been}} widely used as a building element {{in the construction of}} either commercial or governmental buildings, and has been proven to be an economic roofing system. However, little research has been conducted into its thermal performance and the effect of the absorptivity (colour) of its external surface on space cooling load in the hot humid area. This paper aims to investigate the thermal performance of the LASRS. A dynamic model is introduced for analyzing the transient heat transfer <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofs,</b> which was solved by the control volume finite-difference method employing an explicit scheme and validated by measured data. The simulation results show that <b>the</b> heat flux <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> system with a polyurethane insulation layer is smaller than that <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lightweight <b>roof</b> with glasswool insulation R 1. The space cooling load reduction ratio for light painted envelop could reach about 9. 3 % compared with black painted one. The cooling load reduction ratio ranges from 1. 3 % to 9. 3 % for <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> structure R 1 with various surface colour. Therefore, the space cooling load for air conditioning of the building can be considerably reduced (up to 20 %) by employing a lightweight roof using polyurethane insulation with white painted surface colour.

5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went {{straight}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair and putting it out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war. The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E

The video was officially uploaded on YouTube on 22 September. Directed by Michael Sauer Christensen, it is set in an eerie, empty house that is reminiscent of a horror film, where a black cloud wanders through {{the halls of the}} house. The members wear black and gray clothing in the video, with Nystrom's costume gradually changing throughout. The video ends by the members exiting the house <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and transforming into a beam of light shooting into the sky.

5|$|Power outages {{began in}} some neighborhoods at 6:30p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12hours {{before the storm}} arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island. The night saw heavy rains, 4cm (1.58inches) at Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80knots (90mph, 145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the emergency room. A section of the cafeteria also lost its roof, {{but no one was}} injured in either incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{cessation}} of diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar prompted immediate French {{military action in}} a campaign that {{became known as the}} Second Franco-Hova War. The expedition ended eleven months later in September 1895 when a French military column reached Antananarivo and bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, blasting a hole <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the queen's quarters and inflicting heavy casualties among the numerous courtiers gathered in the palace courtyard. Rainilaiarivony sent an interpreter to carry a white flag to the French commander and entreat his clemency. Forty-five minutes later he was joined by Radilifera, the Prime Minister's son, to request the conditions of surrender; these were immediately accepted. The following day Queen Ranavalona signed a treaty accepting the French protectorate over Madagascar. She and her court were permitted to remain at the palace and administer the country according to French dictates.|$|E
5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in The Awful Truth. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E
