5|$|Protactinium {{exhibits}} two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus <b>tetravalent</b> protactinium in solutions {{is obtained}} {{by the action of}} strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. <b>Tetravalent</b> protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element.|$|E
5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas <b>tetravalent</b> thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides.

The characterization of a family of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP 3) antigens sharing a similar structural organization, simultaneously expressed on the merozoite surface and targeted by a cross-reactive network of protective antibodies, is intriguing and offers new perspectives for the development of subunit vaccines against malaria. Methods: Eight recombinant polyproteins containing carefully selected regions of this family covalently linked in different combinations were all efficiently produced in Escherichia coli. The polyproteins consisted of one monovalent, one bivalent, one trivalent, two <b>tetravalents,</b> one hexavalent construct, and two <b>tetravalents</b> incorporating coiled-coil repeats regions from LSA 3 and p 27 vaccine candidates. Results: All eight polyproteins induced a strong and homogeneous antibody response in mice of three distinct genotypes, with a dominance of cytophilic IgG subclasses, lasting up to six months after the last immunization. Vaccine-induced antibodies exerted a strong monocyte-mediated in vitro inhibition of P. falciparum growth.

5|$|Lead shows {{two main}} {{oxidation}} states: +4 and +2. The <b>tetravalent</b> state {{is common for}} the carbon group. The divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon, minor for germanium, important (but not prevailing) for tin, and is the more important for lead. This is attributable to relativistic effects, specifically the inert pair effect, which manifests itself {{when there is a}} large difference in electronegativity between lead and oxide, halide, or nitride anions, leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. This is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp3 hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is predominantly <b>tetravalent</b> in such compounds.|$|E

Progeny resulting from double reduction were observed, and the occurrence of a null allele class at Mpi was noted. A reexamination of expected progeny ratios in tetraploid organisms reveals that tetrasomic inheritance patterns cannot be predicted without adequate knowledge of the amount of crossing-over, the proportion of <b>tetravalents</b> vs. random bivalents that are formed, and the ratio and types of centromere segregation (alternate and adjacent) that occur from <b>tetravalents</b> in the species being studied.

Forty-eight percent of the pollinations formed pegs when A. duranensis × A. glabrata was pollinated with A. hypogaea pollen. Morphologically, the hybrid had erect growth habit and resembled A. hypogaea. The flower buds had short hypanthium and flowers were pale yellow as observed on A. duranensis. Of the 485 pegs formed, 3 pods were obtained. Two of the pods had large but immature seeds and one pod had a mature seed. Triploid hybrid A. diogoi × A. glabrata was crossed with A. glabrata. The bivalent formation in the hybrid ranged from 7 to 10 {{with a mean of}} 9 per meiocyte. The number of univalents ranged from 10 to 16 with a mean of 12 per meiocyte. Both ring (4 per cell) and rod (6 per cell) bivalents were present.

40|$|Artificial {{tetraploid}} somatic hybrids {{have been}} developed for sterile triploid citrus breeding by sexual hybridization between diploid and tetraploid somatic hybrids. The genetic structure of diploid gametes produced by tetraploid genotypes depends on the mode of chromosome association at meiosis. In order to evaluate tetraploid inheritance in a tetraploid interspecific somatic hybrid between mandarin and lemon, we performed segregation studies using cytogenetic and single sequence repeat molecular markers. Cytogenetic analysis of meiosis in the somatic hybrid revealed 11 % <b>tetravalents</b> and 76 % bivalents. Inheritance of the tetraploid hybrid was analyzed by genotyping the triploid progeny derived from a cross between a diploid pummelo and the tetraploid somatic hybrid, in order to derive genotypes of the meiospores produced by the tetraploid. A likelihood-based approach was used to distinguish between disomic, tetrasomic, and intermediate inheritance models and to estimate the double reduction rate. In agreement with expectations based the cytogenetic data, marker segregation was largely compatible with tetrasomic and inheritance intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic, with some evidence for preferential pairing of homoeologous chromosomes. This has important implications for the design of breeding programs that involve tetraploid hybrids, and underscores the need to consider inheritance models that are intermediate between disomic and tetrasomic.

40|$|A smart fully {{automated}} system is proposed for determination of thorium and uranium {{in a wide}} concentration range, reaching environmental levels. The hyphenation of lab-on-valve (LOV) and multisyringe flow injection analysis (MSFIA), coupled to a long path length liquid waveguide capillary cell, allows the spectrophotometric determination of thorium and uranium in different types of environmental sample matrices achieving high selectivity and sensitivity levels. Online separation and preconcentration of thorium and uranium is carried out by means of Uranium and <b>TEtraValents</b> Actinides resin.

40|$|Background: Natural {{polyploidy}} {{has played}} an important role during the speciation and evolution of vertebrates, including anurans, with more than 55 described cases. The species of the Phyllomedusa burmeisteri group are mostly characterized by having 26 chromosomes, but a karyotype with 52 chromosomes was described in P. tetraploidea. This species was found in sintopy with P. distincta in two localities of São Paulo State (Brazil), where triploid animals also occur, as consequence of natural hybridisation. We analyse the chromosomes of P. distincta, P. tetraploidea, and their triploid hybrids, to enlighten the origin of polyploidy and to obtain some evidence on diploidisation of tetraploid karyotype. Results: Phyllomedusa distincta was 2 n = 2 x = 26, whereas P. tetraploidea was 2 n = 4 x = 52, and the hybrid individuals was 2 n = 3 x = 39. In meiotic phases, bivalents were observed in the diploid males, whereas both bivalents and <b>tetravalents</b> were observed in the tetraploid males. Univalents, bivalents or trivalents; metaphase II cells carrying variable number of chromosomes; and spermatids were detected in the testis preparations of the triploid males, indicating that the triploids were not completely sterile. In natural and experimental conditions, the triploids cross with the parental species, producing abnormal egg clutches and tadpoles with malformations. The embryos and tadpoles exhibited intraindividual karyotype variability and all of the metaphases contained abnormal constitutions. Multiple NORs, detected by Ag-impregnation and FISH with an rDNA probe, were observed on chromosome 1 in the three karyotypic forms; and, additionally, on chromosome 9 in the diploids, mostly on chromosome 8 in the tetraploids, and on both chromosome 8 and 9 in the triploids. Nevertheless, NOR-bearing chromosome 9 was detected in the tetraploids, and chromosome 9 carried active or inactive NORs in the triploids. C-banding, base-specific fluorochrome stainings with CMA 3 and DAPI, FISH with a telomeric probe, and BrdU incorporation in DNA showed nearly equivalent patterns in the karyotypes of P. distincta, P. tetraploidea, and the triploid hybrids.

When the genomes existing in quadruplicate in the parental hexaploids are non-homologous, such non-homology may cause failure of chromosome pairing in a BC_ 1 or double-cross progeny. Meiotic analyses of these hexaploid hybrids showed almost complete chromosome pairing at the matephase I (MI), suggesting that the hexaploids DH and K 123 have the same genomic structure just as do SH and the sweet potato. Further, to clarify the genomic structure of the sweet potato and the I. tnfida hexaploids by estimating the degree of homology between the B_ 1 and B_ 2 genomes, meiotic pairing was observed in the tetraploid hybrids (B_ 1 B_ 1 B_ 2 B_ 2) from DH×K 221 and tetraploid hybrids (B_ 1 B_ 2 B_ 2 B_ 2) from (DH×K 221) ×K 233.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of germplasm {{of the wild}} species in sweet-potato breeding has been conducted {{for the last three}} decades. Such attempts brought some remarkable achievments in improving root yield, starch content and resistance to the nematodes of sweet potato. Some wild plants in polyploid series may have many genes potentially important for further improvement of the agronomic traits. However, the genomic relationship between the wild relatives and hexaploid sweet potato (2 n= 6 x= 90) has been unrevealed. Meiotic studies were carried out on the hexaploids synthesized with diploids and tetraploids and on the F_ 1 hybrids, when possible, with sweet potato. Chromosomes in pollen mother cells (PMC's) and root tip cells were fixed in New-comer's solution and stained according to Feulgen reaction with Schiff's reagent. The present report was concerned wlth two kinds of the synthetic hexaploids. The first was the hexaploids derived from chromosome doubling of triploid hybrids between Ipomoea lacunosa (K 61, 2 n= 30) and I. tiliacea (K 134, 2 n= 60). the synthetic hexaploid exhibited mostly regular meiosis with bivalents at the metaphase I stage (MI), and it was considered an allo- or segmental allo-hexaploid. The synthetic hexaploids were fertile, but failure in obtaining hybrids by crosses with sweet potato suggested a critical reproductive barrier between them. The second synthetic hexaploids with 2 x I, trifida (K 221, 2 n= 30) and 4 x I,trifida (K 233, 2 n= 60) showed the chromosome configurations characterized by the occurrence of <b>tetravalents</b> and hexavalents. Such multivalent associations, high in frequency and number per cell, suggested the presence of the genomes at least in quadruplicate. Similar pattern of the chromosome configura-tions was observed in a cultivar of sweet potato and the F_ 1 hybrid between the synthetic hexaploid and sweet potato. Consequently, the genomic formula for sweet potato was proposed as B 1 B 1 B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2, in which B 1 B 1 was given to 2 x I. trifida and B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2 to 4 x I. trifida. However, it is necessary to clarify the degree of homology between B 1 and B 2 genomes for more conclusive genomic constitution of sweet potato. A brief account was given for the taxonomic identification of the wild Ipomoea strains used in the present study. サツマイモ育種では,生殖質の多様化をはかる方法の一環として,近縁野生種の育種的利用を進めてきた. その成果として,線虫低抗性をもつ高でん粉多収性の系統・品種育成をみるにいたった. サツマイモは 6 倍体(2 n= 90) で,一方,その近縁野生種には 2 倍体, 4 倍体, 6 倍体がある. これら野生種およびサツマイモの倍数性に関与しているゲノムについてはいまだ十分解明されていない. 本報告では,野生種をもちいてできた 2 種類の合成 6 倍体,それらの両親,およびサツマイモとの交雑から生じたF_ 1 雑種について,減数分裂第 1 分裂中期の染色体対合を観察し,それら植物のゲノム構成を明らかにしようとした. 第 1 の合成 6 倍体はIpomoea lacunosa(K 61, 2 n= 30) とI. tiliacea(K 134, 2 例= 60) との 3 倍体雑種の染色体倍加によってえられた(Fig. 1). この 6 倍体では,低頻度の 1 価, 3 価, 4 価染色体がみられたが,平均 41. 3 の 2 価染色体がみられた. そして平均 43. 2 の 2 価染色体相当数があり,全体として異質または部分異質 6 倍体の染色体対合とみたすことができた(Table 1). 3 倍体雑種としてはI. trichocarpa(K 231, 2 n= 30) とK 134 との雑種が供試された。I. lacunssaとI. trichocarpaは共通のゲノムAをもつことが明らかにたっている・またJONES(1970) によれば, I. tiliaceaは異質 4 倍体としての染色体対合を示している. 以上のことから,I. tiliaceaのゲノム構成をA 1 A 1 TTとして,合成 6 倍体に暫定的たゲノム式AAA 1 A 1 TTを与えた. この合成 6 倍体は高い稔性をもつが,サツマイモとの交雑からは雑種を得ることはできたかった (K. A. E. S. 1963) ...|$|R
5|$|Valence 3 is {{dominant}} in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with {{the possible exception}} of nobelium). Curium can be <b>tetravalent</b> in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, more stable than that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and <b>tetravalent</b> lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms {{a number}} of {{chemical}} compounds, where it normally exists in an oxidation state of +3 or +4, and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue, terbium. Like all actinides, berkelium easily dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state. This trivalent state is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but <b>tetravalent</b> berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of the Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide surface layer; however, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds. Berkelium can also form several organometallic compounds.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was <b>tetravalent,</b> Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{berkelium}} dissolves {{in various}} aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium(III) state.

The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, terbium. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids.

5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be <b>tetravalent</b> in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be <b>tetravalent.</b> Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
