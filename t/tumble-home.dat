2500|$|When the France was {{commissioned}} in 1956 the French Line {{asked for a}} ship {{which was to be}} the longest ever built, as well as one of the fastest. But beyond the technicalities, the ship was also to be a Ship of State – an ocean-going symbol of France – and thus had to be artfully designed. Her 316-meter (1,035ft) hull was designed with a traditional <b>tumble-home,</b> but with a flared stem line at the bow, which ended in a bulbous bow beneath the waterline, evoking similar lines on [...] Also similar to the Normandie, the France was equipped with a whaleback on her bow.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the second}} Saunders {{aircraft}} to use their patented [...] "corrugated" [...] structure for the hull, first trialled on the Saunders A.14, in which longitudinal external corrugations in the skin replaced internal riveted stringers. Full trials of the A.14, revealing both {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of this technique were not made until after the Severn had flown. [...] Like the A.14 the Severn's construction largely avoided doubly curved hull plating, so the planing bottom was strictly V-shaped and the upper hull rather slab sided. [...] The hull was a two-step design with <b>tumble-home</b> sides above the chines. [...] There was a gunner's position in the nose and a side-by-side open cockpit for the pilots ahead of the engines and wing. [...] Behind the cockpit and within a windowed part of the hull were crew positions and accommodation, from which a dorsal gunner's position just aft of the wings could be accessed. [...] There was an isolated rear gunner's position at the extreme rear of the upswept rear fuselage, above the braced tailplane and between the two braced fins. [...] Twin balanced elevators projected beyond the tailplane and the fins carried balanced rudders. [...] Early flight trials showed the Severn to be heavy on rudder control, so separate servo-rudders were soon fixed on struts behind the main rudder surfaces. [...] It was also heavy on elevators, which were increased in area.|$|E
60|$|The other man, {{a slender}} German {{of five and}} twenty, with the massive {{forehead}} of a scholar and the <b>tumble-home</b> chin of a degenerate, did not trouble to reply. He was busy emptying powdered quinine into a cigarette paper. Rolling what was approximately fifty grains of the drug into a tight wad, he tossed {{it into his mouth}} and gulped it down without the aid of water.|$|E
60|$|The Snark was forty-three {{feet on the}} water-line and fifty-five over all, with {{fifteen feet}} beam (<b>tumble-home</b> sides) and seven feet eight inches draught. She was ketch-rigged, {{carrying}} flying-jib, jib, fore-staysail, main-sail, mizzen, and spinnaker. There were six feet of head-room below, and she was crown-decked and flush-decked. There were four alleged WATER-TIGHT compartments. A seventy-horse power auxiliary gas-engine sporadically furnished locomotion at an approximate cost of twenty dollars per mile. A five-horse power engine ran the pumps when it was in order, and on two occasions proved capable of furnishing juice for the search-light. The storage batteries worked {{four or five times}} in the course of two years. The fourteen-foot launch was rumoured to work at times, but it invariably broke down whenever I stepped on board.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} at the water side to look at the boat, at the wish of Madam de Lacey, the widow of my late noble Commander and Admiral; and, let other men think as they may, I am ready to swear that the 'Royal Caroline' has as well secured a {{bowsprit}} as any ship that carries the British flag! Ay, nor is that all I will say in her favour; she is throughout neatly and lightly sparred, and has no more of a wall-side than the walls of yonder church <b>tumble-home.</b> I am an old man, and my reckoning has got to the last leaf of the log-book; therefore it is little interest that I have, or can have, in this brig or that schooner, but this much will I say, which is, that it is just as wicked, and as little likely to be forgiven, to speak scandal of a wholesome and stout ship, as it is to talk amiss of mortal Christian." ...|$|E
5000|$|Model C: Model C, carries {{about the}} same {{dimensions}} as Model A, except that it has less <b>tumble-home</b> and sharper lines for and aft. It is a fairly speedy canoe. (1919 Catalog) ...|$|E
5000|$|Model D: Model D is {{a design}} with more {{freeboard}} and less <b>tumble-home.</b> Has quite a flat bottom, and is quite seaworthy. its paddling qualities in quick water are excellent, {{and it is}} unequalled as an open sailing canoe. Its principal uses are hunting and cruising. (1919 Catalog) ...|$|E
50|$|Right at {{the turn}} of the century, French design absorbed {{influences}} from foreign practice. Her newer battleships featured two twin 300mm gun turrets as opposed to single mounts, less exaggerated <b>tumble-home</b> of the hull, and abandonment of the ram bow. This led to improved seakeeping characteristics, though the ships remained small.|$|E
50|$|French capital {{ships of}} this time were {{instantly}} identifiable by their small size (10,000 tons), huge spur rams, great height and pronounced <b>tumble-home.</b> Often carrying only half the main armament of their British contemporaries, French battleships had armoured masts with electric elevators inside, outsized funnels, and elaborate davit systems to swing out boats from the narrow upper decks.|$|E
5000|$|The Queen II {{could make}} it to Isle Royale in about four hours, which nearly cut travel time in half. She possessed three Gray Marine engines (later {{replaced}} with twin diesel engines), could carry 57 people, and could carry [...] tons of extra gear. Captain F. Manzzutti, a marine surveyor who surveyed the Queen, described the new vessel as such:"a specially designed, staunch, graceful, open-water long-voyage, heavy weather ferry [...] [...] [...] with a gracefully raked stem, streamline, contour, elliptical after-splay; <b>tumble-home</b> transom; rounded forefoot; slightly flared, raised bow; straight sides; v-bow merging into semi-modest v-bottom to midship, thence to a near-flat bottom to the reinforced transom area." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{new world}} {{situation}} and important {{changes in the}} military policy of the United States have made it necessary to find new alternatives for warships. Affordability, high performance and excellent seakeeping, combined {{with a high degree}} of survivability, are essentials for the new century. The trimaran hull form holds promise in fulfilling future needs of Navy combatants. This thesis attempts to make an evaluation of the response of the trimaran hull under nine (9) different cases of damage stability. The specifications of the multihull correspond to a ' 4600 Tonnes Trimaran Warship' in the process of being evaluated by NAVSEA. Many analysis problems were encountered because of the unusual type of <b>tumble-home</b> hull and the 'wavepiecer' shape of the bow. The results show an overall good response to a damage stability analysis. The critical case, unsurprisingly, has been found to be when one side hull is flooded and the tanks in the opposite hull are completely empty. Important conclusions and data were obtained, and future research areas are identified. NANAColombian Navy author...|$|E
