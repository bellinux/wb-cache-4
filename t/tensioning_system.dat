40|$|Abstract: In <b>tension</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the main}} concern is to {{decouple}} the tension and velocity in spite of radius variations and other perturbations. To solve this control problem and design the optimal controller, this paper develops a mixed-sensitivity robust H ∞ control based on self-optimizing algorithm. First, the modeling of the <b>tension</b> <b>system</b> is presented with relative theorems. Second, a mixed-sensitivity robust H ∞ control which reduces the coupling between tension and velocity is compared to PID controller. But the H ∞ controller is conservative, the H ∞ controller method with parameter fuzzification is introduced. At low velocity, the H∞ control method with parameter fuzzification gets fine results. However, for the high velocity and real time requirements of <b>tension</b> <b>system,</b> the H ∞ control method with parameter fuzzification cannot keep the controller optimal always. Therefore the tension robust control strategy based on self-optimizing algorithm is proposed. The controller is optimized by hyper generation GA (HGGA) which reduces computing time. Furthermore, the current error and the change of the error are turned to compensate time delay. In order to test {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms, the tension experiment platform analog system is developed based on DSP (TMS 320 LF 2407 A) board. Finally the algorithms in this paper are tested in <b>tension</b> <b>system</b> platform, and the feasibility has been verified.

40|$|When {{simulating}} {{a molecular}} system, a cutoff distance for interactions {{is often used}} to speed up the simulations. This is made at the cost of neglecting some interactions which will lead to inaccurate results for energy, pressure components and surface <b>tension</b> (for <b>systems</b> with surfaces). To compensate for the neglected long-range interactions, continuum corrections can be added to the surface <b>tension,</b> <b>system</b> energies and pressures. For a homogenous isotropic system this is straight-forward but for a system with a surface it is more complicated. In this work we have derived expressions for the corrections to the surface <b>tension,</b> <b>system</b> energies and pressures that are more general than previous results. When these corrections are added to multi-component systems with a surface (or single-component systems with vacuum) they compensate for the change in surface <b>tension,</b> <b>system</b> energy and pressures due to the finite cutoff. When simulating systems with no Coulomb-interactions, the structure of the system may change significantly if the cutoffs are too short. If this is the case then these corrections alone will not be enough. The solution is to add corrections to the force acting on each molecule added during the simulation, which we derive in this work. This solves the structural problem at low cutoffs and makes it possible to calculate an accurate surface tension independent of cutoff. ...|$|R
