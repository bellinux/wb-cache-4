5|$|As of 2012 {{the ground}} and top floors of the main house, {{together}} with the adjacent wings, are used as accommodation for the elderly. The reception rooms of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> {{are open to the}} public at advertised times, and are entered by the original stairway on the south front; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family. Some items in the collection had formerly been displayed on this floor, whilst others were moved from elsewhere in the house. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> may also be hired for weddings, meetings, and conferences. It is managed by a trust, which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor,</b> possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Bodily {{and spiritual}} needs were {{balanced}} symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, {{rising from the}} semi-basement to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor.</b> This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 26, a pipe burst {{near the}} west public parking entrance, causing <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> {{of the tower}} to flood.|$|E

50|$|The 3-level {{basement}} has a food court, while <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two <b>floors</b> include <b>the</b> Hyatt's {{conference and}} banquet facilities. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> six <b>floors</b> include a shopping mall, restaurants, and nightclubs, include Pu-J's.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} {{consist of}} a brick and glass facade with some units having balconies. Amenities for residents would include a private movie theater and gym. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>floors</b> will have shops and restaurants.|$|R
5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back fireplaces, but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor,</b> and two bedrooms in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second floors are uncertain; one theory is that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> was an armoury. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, {{the remains of}} which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{described}} as a satellite terminal, the terminal building is connected by an above-ground corridor to Terminal 2.

5|$|Below {{the tower}} is an Italianate building. On {{the ground floor}} was the Scarlet Drawing Room and a {{vestibule}} with an annexe which housed a kitchen and offices. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> held the Crimson Drawing Room, sanctuary and library.|$|E
5|$|Burges {{designated}} the final room on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> an armoury {{and used it}} to display his large collection of armour.

5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn, the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> were opened.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{evacuations}} continued {{from other}} area hospitals that were flooded or damaged.

Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} had three main <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> pedestrian entrances, {{located on the}} south, east, and west elevations.

2500|$|In 2001, the Texas Medical Center was [...] "devastated" [...] {{according}} to ABC by flooding which flooded basements and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floors</b> with 18 inches of water. This resulted in retrofitting of storm doors and barriers {{to prevent future}} flooding.|$|R

5|$|In 1922, {{the lease}} passed to Arthur Dorrien-Smith, {{who agreed to}} pass several {{properties}} on Tresco, including the castle, into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works. The castle was partially excavated in 1954, uncovering coins, pottery and a buckle.

5|$|In addition, {{the house}} has nine {{bathrooms}} and one elevator, which {{were taken from the}} Mellon Mansion. Also taken from the Mellon Mansion were two fireplaces.
