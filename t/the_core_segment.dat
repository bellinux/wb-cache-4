30|$|Hence, one {{can argue}} that the Hartz reform package {{established}} a rather ‘implicit’ linkage between (i) activation-oriented active labour market and social policies aimed at reducing benefit dependency and increasing labour supply and (ii) labour market flexibilisation aiming at more dynamic job creation, in particular {{in the service sector}} (Eichhorst et al. 2008; Ebbinghaus and Eichhorst 2009; Caliendo and Hogenacker 2012). The increase in labour supply (due to activation) was to be absorbed by a more flexible labour market, i.e. in “new” flexible segments such as start-ups, part-time and minor jobs, but also temporary agency work. The expectations that of the Hartz reforms, such as significantly reducing unemployment in Germany and overcoming persistently high structural unemployment, have partly been realised as the increase in total employment and the related decline in inactivity and unemployment show. Yet, employers could now shift more and more employment risks onto the flexible part of the labour force and assign more tasks to flexible and low paid workers. The widespread perception is that the German labour market has become more flexible and more conducive to the creation of jobs, but on average this has come at the price of having more heterogeneity between jobs and an increasingly large share of non-standard, i.e. more fragile, employment and low pay. The growth of the secondary segment has also contributed to fears in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>segment</b> regarding downward mobility of pay and employment stability.|$|E

Two subsets of T cells (called A and B) interact with the same peptide, each in unique ways that reflect {{the nature of}} the complex of peptide and MHC. We show that the A and B set of T cells can be distinguished by their functional interaction with the three T cell receptor (TCR) contact residues of the bound peptide. The dominant peptide of HEL selected from processing is bound in a single register where a critical TCR contact residue is situated about the middle of <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>segment</b> of the peptide: all T cells establish functional contact with it. Three sets of T cells, however, can be distinguished by their differential recognition of two TCR contacts situated at the amino and carboxyl sides of the central TCR contact residue. Type A T cells, the conventional cells that see the peptide after processing of HEL, need to recognize all three TCR contact residues. In contrast, the type B T cells recognize the peptide given exogenously, but not when processed: these T cells recognize either one of the peripheral TCR contact residues, indicating a much more flexible interaction of peptide with I-Ak molecules.

Cluster analysis revealed 21 different biotypes based on similarities of 75 % or higher in response patterns to 21 physiological assays.

We first identify a consistent power model for the MSes and the network equipment in an integrated metro/access architecture scenario, then we define a strategy to switch on and off the network interfaces and the MSes depending on the VoD traffic load variation during the day.

Hofer, Microbiology 149 : 1475 - 1481, 2003). It comprises the PCR amplification of segments of alpha subunit genes of unknown sequence that encode the catalytic center and their fusion with sequences of the bphA gene cluster of Burkholderia xenovorans LB 400. One of the resulting chimeric enzymes, harboring <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>segment</b> of a dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain B 4 -Magdeburg, has now been characterized {{with respect to the}} oxidation of chlorobiphenyls (CBs). Its substrate and product specificities differed favorably from those of the parental dioxygenase of strain LB 400. The hybrid possessed a higher regiospecificity and yielded less unproductive dioxygenations at meta and para carbons. It attacked ortho-, meta-, and para-chlorinated rings with comparable efficiencies. It gave significantly higher yields in ortho,meta-dioxygenation of recalcitrant congeners containing a doubly ortho-chlorinated ring. While the parental enzyme yielded mainly unproductive meta, para dioxygenation of 2, 5, 4 ′-CB, the hybrid predominantly converted this congener into an ortho,meta-dioxygenated product. The subsequent enzymes of the LB 400 catabolic pathway were able to transform most of the metabolites formed by the novel dioxygenase, indicating that the substrate ranges of these biocatalysts are not adapted to that of their initial pathway enzyme. Some of the catabolites, however, were identified as problematic for further degradation. Our results demonstrate that the outlined approach can successfully be applied to obtain novel dioxygenase specificities that favorably complement or supplement known ones...|$|E
