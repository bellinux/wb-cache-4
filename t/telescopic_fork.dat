25|$|In {{motorcycles}} with <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> tubes, fork offset can {{be implemented}} by either an offset in the triple tree, adding a triple tree rake (usually measured in degrees from 0) to the fork tubes as they mount into the triple tree, {{or a combination of}} the two. Other, less-common motorcycle forks, such as trailing link or leading link forks, can implement offset by the length of link arms.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950 {{the company}} went into {{liquidation}} and was acquired by Scott enthusiast Matt Holder's Aerco Jig and Tool Company in Birmingham. From his premises in St Mary's Row, Holder, who was an expert silversmith initially continued to build the same model from Shipley-made spare parts. These [...] "Birmingham Scotts" [...] remained available into the 1960s. In 1956 Holder began development of a 596cc model with a duplex frame and <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> front. When Matt's son David Holder moved the remaining stock to the former Triumph Motorcycles 'Number 2' factory at Meriden he found {{that his father had}} accumulated a huge collection of original Scott parts, including Miller headlights and Burgess silencers. In 1958 the Birmingham Scott was updated by adding a swinging arm frame and the dynamo was replaced by an alternator. [...] A new 493cc motorcycle called the Scott Swift was announced but never went into production, although Holder continued to develop and produce one-off Scott motorcycles until 1978.|$|E
50|$|A <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> {{is a form}} of {{motorcycle}} front suspension {{whose use}} is so common that it is virtually universal. The <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> uses fork tubes and sliders which contain the springs and dampers.|$|E
50|$|The first {{production}} motorcycles with hydraulically damped <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> {{were the}} German BMW R12 and R17 in 1935. However, undamped <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> were used on bikes made by The Scott Motorcycle Company {{from the beginning}} of production in 1908, and the Danish Nimbus used them from 1934 on.|$|R
5000|$|Harley-Davidson {{introduced}} the Softail chassis in 1984. [...] The original Softails used the small FX <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks,</b> but the FLST Heritage Softail with large FL <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> {{was introduced in}} 1986. The FLSTC Heritage Softail Classic, with large front forks and retro styling, was in production by 1988.|$|R

5000|$|Scott {{produced}} a motorcycle with <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> in 1908, and {{would continue to}} use them until 1931. In 1935 BMW became the first manufacturer to produce a motorcycle with hydraulically damped <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks.</b> Most motorcycles today use <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> for the front suspension. The forks can be most easily understood as simply large hydraulic shock absorbers with internal coil springs. They allow the front wheel to react to imperfections in the road while isolating {{the rest of the}} motorcycle from that motion.The top of the forks are connected to the motorcycles frame in a triple tree clamp (known as a [...] "yoke" [...] in the UK), which allows the forks to be turned in order to steer the motorcycle. The bottom of the forks is connected to the front wheels axle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more modern}} (and more expensive) {{version of the}} {{conventional}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> is the inverted or [...] "USD" [...] (upside-down) fork.|$|E
50|$|A <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> uses fork tubes {{which contain}} the {{suspension}} components (coil springs and damper) internally. This {{is the most}} common form of fork commercially available. It may or may not include gaiters for protection against abrasive elements on the suspension cylinders. The main advantages of the <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> are that (i) it is simple in design and relatively cheap to manufacture and assemble; (ii) it is lighter than older designs using external components and linkage systems; and (iii) it has a clean and simple appearance that bikers find attractive.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, BMW fitted {{the first}} mass-produced {{hydraulically}} damped <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> to its R12 and R17 motorcycles. BMW still uses telescopic forks today on its F-series, G-series, HP, and S1000RR motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|Front: Twin <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks.</b> Oil-filled damper {{with spring}} preload {{adjustment}} only.Rear: Single rising rate shock. Pro-Link with external coil. Variable spring preload adjustment only.|$|R
50|$|The Saxon-Motodd (marketed as Telelever by BMW) has a {{wishbone}} that mounts to {{the frame}} and supports the monoshock unit. This relieves the forks of any braking and suspension forces. With a Telelever, the trail and castor angle (rake) increases during braking instead of decreasing as with traditional <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks.</b> BMW's boxer twins have been equipped with Telelever forks since 1994, but some newer boxers like the BMW R nineT have reverted to conventional <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> for aesthetic and packaging reasons.|$|R

50|$|Front {{suspension}} was revamped on {{the fifth}} generation TMAX with an upside down (inverted) <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> with radial-mounted brake calipers. Bodywork received modest styling updates. Yamaha also produced an IRON MAX special edition.|$|E
50|$|The MAC Scrambler {{was also}} the {{beginning}} of the VanTech Leading Link Fork. In addition to giving 6+ inches of travel, the fork was approximately four pounds lighter than any <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> then available.|$|E
50|$|The Ariel Ace {{comes with}} a choice of two {{alternative}} front suspensions; either a conventional upside-down <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork,</b> or Ariel's own girder fork. Rear suspension uses a single-sided swingarm. Final drive is shaft drive.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 Anstey-link plunger rear {{suspension}} was an option. It was still available when production restarted in 1946, with <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> replacing the girder forks.|$|R

5000|$|The BMW R1100RS used a {{frameless}} design, {{using the}} engine as a stressed member, an approach used by BMW for all subsequent oilheads (except the R1100S). Instead of having conventional <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks,</b> the R1100RS used BMW's own Telelever suspension which bolted {{directly to the}} engine. The Telelever design has a superficially similar appearance to <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks,</b> but braking forces are taken back horizontally, minimising [...] "fork dive". A rear subframe supported the rider, passenger and luggage. Both fully faired and half-faired variants were available.|$|R
50|$|Full {{suspension}} (or dual suspension): A bicycle {{equipped with}} both {{front and rear}} suspension. The front suspension is usually a <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork</b> {{similar to that of}} a motorcycle, and the rear by a mechanical linkage with components for absorbing shock.|$|E
50|$|The Mustang was a {{lightweight}} motorcycle built by Gladden Products Corporation in Glendale, California, from 1946 to 1965. The second production version, the Mustang Model 2, {{was the first}} motorcycle manufactured in the United States to have a <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
50|$|BMW's {{patented}} telelever front suspension {{appears at}} first glance to be conventional <b>telescopic</b> <b>fork,</b> but the fork tubes contain neither springs nor damping. Instead, a wishbone and an inboard monoshock perform suspension duties, and the forks serve to locate the front wheel and control steering.|$|E
50|$|The BMW R50/5, R60/5, and R75/5 form a {{range of}} boxer twin {{motorcycles}} manufactured in Berlin, Germany, by BMW for model years 1970-1973 and featuring electric starting and <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1950, the V-twin {{engine was}} {{enlarged}} to [...] and <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks</b> were adopted. But Indian's financial problems meant that few bikes were built. Production of the Chief ended in 1953.|$|R
5000|$|ETS250 : Sports {{version of}} the ES but with more {{traditional}} type of tank and <b>telescopic</b> <b>forks.</b> The distinctive 5 imp gal fuel tank makes this model a desirable classic motorcycle.|$|R
