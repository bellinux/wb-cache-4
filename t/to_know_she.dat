He was adamant {{that she was not}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E

[...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> would be a wonderful mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby."

500|$|Aden and Belle are {{involved}} in a storyline where the school's formal is set on fire. Belle becomes trapped and her injuries have [...] "consequences that change their relationship" [...] forever. Lasance had previously been in caught up in a real house fire; he said the director of the episode [...] "milked" [...] the fictional situation to make it seem more dramatic than a real fire. He also stated that in the months following {{there would be a lot}} of [...] "tense moments" [...] between the pair. Aden and Belle can acknowledge what they have found in each other - so [...] "it would be hard to split them up". After the attack and fire, Belle refuses to leave the hospital, even with Aden supporting her, because it is the only place she [...] "feels secure". Belle is prescribed with painkillers to help combat her anxiety disorder. However she becomes addicted to them. Tovey said she does not want Aden to know because of the [...] "shame" [...] and she doesn't want him <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> has failed. She further explained that [...] "addicts withdraw from those around them - which is exactly what she is doing." ...|$|E

500|$|Ritvo {{developed}} cardiomyopathy, {{which had}} killed her brother Louis {{at the age}} of 38, as well as her father at age 73. [...] She had been plagued by unusual fatigue since 1998, and her heart condition was formally diagnosed in January, 2001. She began taking medication and trained on a limited basis from 2003 to 2005, starting about 100 horses in that period, with 15 wins. However, her condition deteriorated. She started only one horse in 2005 and had no starters from 2006 until 2009. In 2008, {{at the age of}} 39, she was placed on a waiting list for a heart transplant. After a seven-month wait, an organ became available on November 13, 2008, and Ritvo received her new heart that day in an operation that lasted 17 hours. [...] She had been hospitalized for most of the previous six months, and {{at the time of her}} surgery her doctors assessed her as having only about two weeks to live. She was discharged from the hospital seven days after her surgery. She later gave a letter to the hospital to pass on to the organ donor's family, but has never heard from them. Ritvo has stated that she wants the donor's family <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is thankful for her new heart, but respects their privacy.|$|E
500|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{presented a}} {{legend of the}} Fairy Flag's origin. This legend concerned a MacLeod who went on a Crusade to the Holy Land. On his journey homewards, the MacLeod attempted to cross a dangerous mountainous pass on the borders of Palestine. Here, he met a hermit who gave him food and shelter. The hermit warned the MacLeod of a dangerous spirit that guards the pass, which had never failed to destroy a true believer. However, {{with the aid of}} a piece of the True Cross and certain directions from the hermit, the MacLeod is able to defeat the [...] "She Devil"—who is called [...] "Nein a Phaipen, or Daughter of Thunder". In reward for conveying some secrets that the spirit wanted some friends <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> revealed to the MacLeod [...] "the future destinies of the Clan". The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that this knowledge was said to have been held by this man's family until its extinction. The spirit then gave the Macleod her girdle, telling him to convert it into a banner. The MacLeod then used his spear as a flag pole. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that the spear was by then since lost, and that the secrets conveyed to MacLeod were lost forever. The writer also gave his own opinion on the origin of the Fairy Flag. The writer stated that the flag most probably originated as a banner used in the Holy Land, and that it was conveyed back home by the character portrayed in the legend.|$|E
2500|$|Dyson {{said the}} family would keep Alexander buried in the Dansville {{cemetery}} {{where she had been}} buried for so many years, and hold services there for her. [...] "I'm truly glad for the closure," [...] she said. [...] "But it hurts <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> died that way. It's terrible, nobody should have to be shot and dragged out into the woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh God! this's hard on me!" [...] he cried. [...] "I'm a man. I {{love that}} girl more than life. And <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>she's</b> {{suffering}} for love of me--for fear of that marriage being forced upon her--to know that while I lie here a helpless cripple--it's almost unbearable." ...|$|R

2500|$|... 26 July: The {{unlisted}} {{phone number}} {{discovered in the}} book is traced to a woman living in Glenelg (Jessica Thomson, previously Harkness). Shown the plaster cast by Paul Lawson, she did not identify that the man was Alf Boxall, or any other person. Lawson's diary entry for that day names her as [...] "Mrs Thompson" [...] and states that she had a [...] "nice figure" [...] and was [...] "very acceptable" [...] (referring to the level of attractiveness) which allows the possibility of an affair with the Somerton man. She was 27 years old in 1948. In a later interview Lawson described her behaviour as being very odd that day. She appeared as if she was about to faint. [...] Jessica Harkness requests that her real name be withheld because she didn't want her husband <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> knew Alf Boxall. Although she was in fact not married at this time, the name she gave police was Jessica Thomson with her real name not being discovered until 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Lady Avon's friends {{may have}} {{concealed}} their true views about Suez. For example, Isaiah Berlin assured [...] "dearest Clarissa" [...] that Eden had acted with [...] "great moral splendour", describing his stance as [...] "very brave", [...] "very patriotic" [...] and [...] "absolutely just", while opining to another acquaintance that his policy had been [...] "childish folly". Lady Avon herself recalled that, though she sought to [...] "bolster up" [...] {{her husband and}} scanned the newspapers for anything that she thought he ought <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> did not feel she [...] "knew enough {{about what was going}} on to try and interfere in any way". Even so, her knowledge of the inner workings of Government was such that she was able to record in her diary the precise stance, at a critical point of the Suez operation, of every member of the Cabinet:ach was asked in turn what they felt about going on. Selwyn , Alec Home, Harold , Alan , Anthony Head, Peter , [...] Eccles, Duncan , James Stuart, Gwilym , and [...] Hailsham were for going on. [...] Kilmuir, [...] Heathcoat Amory, [...] Macloed, Bobbety , Patrick Buchan-Hepburn were for doing whatever Anthony wanted and Lord Selkirk was unintelligible.|$|E
2500|$|... "Happy Anniversary" [...] {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of a dying loved one, which Pierre based on his grandmother, who died several years prior of cancer. [...] " [...] is {{basically}} [...] from the person's point of view who is dying, and all of the things that they can't necessarily say to the person that they're leaving behind," [...] remarked Pierre. The event occurred in late 2009, shortly after the band had learned of a [...] "big break, this big opportunity," [...] which Pierre skipped out on to go see his ailing grandmother. [...] "It was a weird experience being with this shell of a woman that I used <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> couldn't move or communicate," [...] he later said; she passed the next morning. He noted that had he not gone, he would not have had another experience with her, which factored into the song’s lyrics to live in the moment. The band considered it the darkest on the album. The song was so personal, it affected the group recording the song. [...] "The song gives me shivers. I couldn't sing the song [...] I kept breaking down every time I tried to sing it. It was really weird," [...] said Pierre. Pierre interpreted the final song on the album, [...] "Floating Down the River", as a celebration of his newfound excitement for life.|$|E

60|$|That {{is quite}} enough for her. That is {{all she wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> merely asked in case there might be. As it appears there is, she re- settles herself {{in her chair and}} is again all ears.|$|E

5000|$|In November 2013, Joanna Dennehy {{pleaded guilty}} to all three murders and two further {{attempted}} murders.
