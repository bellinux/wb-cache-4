5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast,</b> mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast.</b> Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E
