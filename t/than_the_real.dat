5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|This formula neglects the {{cracking}} pressure required to open both {{first and second}} stages of the regulator, and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the regulator, {{both of which are}} variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator, and flow rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> value.|$|E
5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume it to have been what he intended under that name. It is considerably larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge. The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E

50|$|The {{objectives}} of study are within <b>the</b> domain of <b>real</b> numbers. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> numbers are uniquely picked out (up to isomorphism) by {{the properties of}} a Dedekind complete ordered field, meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires use of second-order logic. The Löwenheim-Skolem theorems tell us that if we restrict ourselves to first-order logic, any axiom system for <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> admits other models, including both models that are smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> and models that are larger. Some of the latter are studied in non-standard analysis.|$|R
5|$|The final {{incident}} of Roy's playing career {{came in the}} closing pages of the last weekly issue, in March 1993, when he lost control of his helicopter and crashed into a field. Thus the weekly strip ended its 39-year unbroken run on a downbeat and unresolved cliffhanger, as Roy was taken into hospital while fans, the media and his family awaited news on his condition. The mystery {{of whether or not}} Roy had survived his crash was unresolved until the first issue of the new Roy of the Rovers Monthly in September 1993, in which readers discovered that the accident had resulted in the amputation of his famous left foot, ending his playing career and resulting in his move to Italy as the manager of Serie A side AC Monza (a fictional top-level Italian club, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> club of the same name).|$|E

The operation formed part of Operation Bodyguard, the cover plan for the Normandy landings in 1944. Titanic was carried out on 5–6 June 1944 by the Royal Air Force and the Special Air Service. The objective of the operation was to drop 500 dummy parachutists in places other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Normandy drop zones, to deceive the German defenders into believing that a large force had landed, drawing their troops away from the beachheads.|$|E

25|$|The {{inherent}} tendency test theoretically {{has a lower}} threshold <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> risk test, thereby causing {{persons who}} are charged with scandalizing contempt to be convicted for the offence with greater ease. In Shadrake, Justice Loh identified two problems with the inherent tendency test {{as it had been}} set out in Wain. First, the High Court had said that the justification for scandalizing contempt was the prevention of interference with the administration of justice as opposed to protecting public confidence in the administration of justice. The former is the concern of sub judice contempt– that is, contempt relating to a case that is currently under consideration by a court– while it is the latter that is concerned with scandalizing contempt. Secondly, such a test indicates that the words in the impugned publication or speech are to be looked at alone. This has the effect of ignoring the circumstances surrounding the utterance or publication of the words, and is excessively harsh.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{the power}} factor of an AC {{electrical power system}} {{is defined as the}} ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the apparent power in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms (V × I). Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time. Apparent power is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power will be greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source, which is normally considered the generator.|$|E

The motivation for the investigation in this topic is mainly based on the demand for an extension of a description logic system to support a default concrete domain for non-linear multivariate equations and inequations. In this report we provide a literature overview that summarizes main mathematical tools for checking whether a set of non-linear multivariate (in-) equations is satisfiable (quantifier elimination problem). In addition, the report describes the interface to a prototype implementation for complex numbers (rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals)</b> provided a description logic system.

A theorem by Doob, sometimes known as Doob's separability theorem, says that any real-valued continuous-time stochastic process has a separable modification.
