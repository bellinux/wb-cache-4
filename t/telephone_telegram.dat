The analysis did not include local telephone traffic (i. e. non-long-distance) nor did it cover incoming messages via mail, telex/telegram or telephone or internal seminars.

Decla {{had been making}} films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, Die Pest in Florenz (1919) and the two parts of Fritz Lang's The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none {{of which could be}} achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like <b>telephones,</b> <b>telegrams</b> and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.|$|R

The divestiture of NTT {{has long been}} a major industrial policy issue in Japan since the common carrier was privatized in 1985. The governmental decision to divest it may influence not only the Japanese telecommunications infrastructure, but also the global telecommunications and information industries in the world, where many common carriers are now facing an environmental change from regulation to competition. A unique feature {{of this study is that}} it employs eight different estimation techniques to obtain a cost function of NTT, so that this research avoids a methodological bias occurring in many empirical studies. This study confirms that NTT has maintained cost subadditivity, but it has failed to establish the status of a natural monopoly in the observed time period. However, it also finds that the NTT divestiture will not produce a price-reducing benefit to Japanese telecommunications consumers. This research result will serve as empirical evidence for guiding the governmental review of this large-scale industrial policy issue in Japan. telecommunications, natural monopoly, data envelopment analysis, regression analysis, goal programming, industrial policy...|$|R
