40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} growing {{literature}} on developing countries’ infrastructure performance measured through frontier analysis techniques. The focus is generally on assessments of operators’ efficiency and productivity growth {{as part of}} benchmarking exercises. Two broad types of benchmarks are identified in the literature. The first is based on cross-country or cross regional performance comparisons, the second compares performance before and after reforms, including privatization. These benchmarks are often {{used to assess the}} impact of potential or actual policy reforms in specific countries. In a growing number of instances, they are also being conducted in the context of tariff revisions to assess the efficiency gains that can be shared with users as part of these revisions. The main policy conclusions are that there is a difference in the performance effect of key reforms, in particular privatization, between the transport sector and the utilities sector but that generally incentive based regulation delivers efficiency in both sectors The main <b>technical</b> <b>conclusion</b> is that even if in developing economies data problems are constraining, these constraints are not as binding as often argued...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} perform {{research}} and scientific inquiries is often among the educational objectives of engineering programmes. While it is logical {{to think that the}} research skills can be developed in the labs, especially when engineering students perform quite a number of experiments while doing their studies, upon closer examination, it is apparent that most laboratory protocols in the introductory classes are demonstration based where students work on a protocol designed by the instructor to prove a concept learned in lecture. Often a laboratory manual starts with theory, description of apparatus, procedures, and then discussion questions. This flow focuses the students’ effort on proving the concept and it is not aligned with the scientific method that advocate starting with observation, forming a hypothesis, logically deriving predictions, performing experiments and finally drawing conclusions. This paper reports on the use of both case-based learning and the scientific method at a laboratory setting in a first year mechanical engineering course. In this case a scenario is provided whereby students need to form a research question and use the scientific method to attain viable <b>technical</b> <b>conclusions.</b> Students found this approach very useful and engaging.

40|$|Psychoanalytic {{disagreements}} are famously heated, polarized, and prolonged. These controversies {{are often}} the reflection of a shared agreement by the participants to engage in debate at an abstract level {{far removed from the}} clinical context in which the disagreement first arose. As a specimen example of such disputes, a case report by Patrick Casement is examined, together with a series of polemical discussions it inspired concerning physical contact suddenly demanded by an analysand in session. Over two dozen authors were almost evenly divided on whether to agree with Casement’s <b>technical</b> <b>conclusions,</b> but showed a disquieting indifference to the detailed information avail-able in his report regarding how this clinical crisis developed. The sub-stantive merits of the contending arguments are not at issue; rather, the point is to demonstrate the crucial need to refine a methodology of contextualization to clarify inferential assumptions in clinical discus-sions. Premature truth claims might then give way to a more rational comparison of the clinical sources of divergent opinions. The term contextual horizon is introduced to facilitate an understanding of how the psychoanalyst makes inferences from the patient’s associations.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether collider produced of subnuclear black holes might constitute a catastrophic risk is explored in a model of Casadio & Harms (2002) that treats them as quantum-mechanical objects. A plausible scenario in which these black holes accrete ambient matter at the Eddington limit shortly after their production, thereby emitting Hawking radiation that would be harmful to Earth and/or CERN and its surroundings, is described. Such black holes are shown to remain undetectable in existing astrophysical observations and thus evade a recent exclusion of risks from subnuclear black holes by Giddings & Mangano (2008) and and a similar one by Koch et al. (2009). I further question that these risk analyses are complete {{for the reason that}} they exclude plausible black-hole parameter ranges from safety consideration without giving any reason. Some feasible operational measures at colliders are proposed that would allow the lowering of any remaining risk probability. Giddings & Mangano drew different general conclusions only because they made different initial assumptions about the properties of microscopic black holes, not because any of their <b>technical</b> <b>conclusions</b> are incorrect.

40|$|In recent years, {{the pace}} of {{technological}} development has grown tremendously. As a result, the half-life of knowledge has decreased from hundreds and tens of years {{to just a few}} years or even mere months in certain fields. In {{order to be able to}} adapt efficiently to this unprecedented wave of knowledge, organizations and individuals must adopt new ways of learning and training. Web-based education is a viable solution to the problem of quickly disseminating fresh knowledge as it emerges. However, one of the main challenges of effective web-based education remains the application of sound educational principles in the design and delivery of technology-enabled courses. Our primary aim has been to provide lecturers with an effective and easy to use system that would assist web-based teaching and learning, allowing them to focus on the application of relevant educational principles rather than requiring them to master arcane technical complexities. To enhance our perspective and better inform our design decisions, we explore the factors contributing to effective web-based education and examine a number of existing lecturing systems applicable to the development and distribution of educational content over the Web. We then investigate means of preparing and presenting educational content. We place particular emphasis on the guiding principles of human interface design that have permeated our work, and have contributed to the enhanced usability characteristics of our system. We then discuss the challenges of data compression and review the technologies we chose to help make our approach viable and efficient. In describing the software architecture of the system, we introduce the various design patterns that have helped our successful implementation gain robustness and flexibility, and discuss various tradeoffs encountered throughout the design and development of the system. Finally, we present the conceptual and <b>technical</b> <b>conclusions</b> we have reached and we briefly explore future avenues of research and indicate a number of particularly interesting and potentially fruitful areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{attempts}} of geological and mining engineers {{to decipher the}} structure of the outermost formations of the earth's crust have led to many comprehensive studies, which now stand as monuments to their efforts. Their studies, in general, are confined almost exclusively to systematic collection, description, and analysis of facts which they were able to obtain by immediate observation at accessible points on and near the surface of the earth. These observations have many times been supported by other researches carried on in chemical, physical, and petrographic laboratories, but many times the complete solution of the problem has been obtained by inference, this often means that only those facts which could be seen were considered a safe basis for the inferred <b>technical</b> <b>conclusions</b> reached by a process of deduction. A disadvantage of this direct method of investigation {{lies in the fact that}} such observations can be made only at certain points where nature has provided especially favorable conditions. The seriousness of this disadvantage has stimulated attempts in the past to develop methods which do not demand direct contact with the subsurface material for the investigating of geological structure, mineral content, and the nature of subsurface formations. Only recently have these methods been developed into usable forms. They are based upon those properties of the minerals, associated minerals, rocks, or structures which produce effects observable at a distance. Therefore, in order that these methods of geological investigation succeed, it is necessary to attach to them all the resources of modern physics or geophysics, which may lead to the determination of the range of practical application of the known physical properties of matter connected with distant effects. This requires a constant improvement of methods and continuous new design of apparatus to keep abreast with new knowledge and ever increasing difficulties in the field as the more simple relations are learned, and the more complex relations left for study. ...|$|R
