5|$|Even once <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> were established, {{they were}} not {{performed}} everywhere Isis's cult was present. The only known sites for her mystery cult were in Italy, Greece, and Anatolia, although she was worshipped in nearly every province of the Roman Empire.

5|$|Some {{aspects of}} <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their {{connection with the}} afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The question of whether <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, {{as well as a}} widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E

5|$|Meditation is an {{integral}} part of the rosary. This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on <b>the</b> <b>mysteries.</b> The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis were {{religious}} initiation rites {{performed in}} {{the cult of the}} goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess Demeter, and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they were not required to worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, and they may have been thought to guarantee that the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife.|$|E

5|$|Isis {{was one of}} many non-Greek deities whose cults {{became part}} of Greek and Roman {{religion}} during the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE), when Greek people and culture spread to lands across the Mediterranean and most of those same lands were conquered by the Roman Republic. Under the influence of Greco-Roman tradition, some of these cults, including that of Isis, developed their own mystery rites. <b>The</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis could have emerged {{as far back as the}} early third century BCE, after the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of Egypt. The Ptolemies promoted the cult of the god Serapis, who incorporated traits of Osiris and of Greek deities like Dionysus and the underworld god Pluto. Isis's cult was conjoined with that of Serapis. She too was reinterpreted to resemble Greek goddesses, particularly Demeter, while retaining many of her Egyptian characteristics. <b>The</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis, modeled on those in Demeter's honor at Eleusis, could have been developed at the same time, as part of this mingling of Greek and Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{texts from}} the Roman Empire refer to <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis, {{but the only}} source to {{describe}} them {{is a work of}} fiction, the novel Metamorphoses, written in the second century CE by Apuleius.

5|$|Several {{texts from}} Roman times refer {{to people who}} were {{initiated}} in the Isis cult. However, the only direct description of <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis comes from Metamorphoses, also known as The Golden Ass, a comic novel from the late second century CE by the Roman author Apuleius.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in praise of the goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from the first century BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis {{is found in the}} first century CE, and they certainly existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. The end product would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated.

Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E

The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants.
