Recording began when Slipknot entered The Mansion and continued until they had finished touring in 2005, reportedly covering 28 months of the bands time together.

During the period in which the footage was being shot, Crahan began making little tests of the footage and revealed them to his fellow band mates, judging their reactions to help him establish areas of interest from them.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the role of intergenerational contact in shaping hiring decisions. Drawing from the intergroup contact theory, the authors investigated affective and cognitive categorization reactions as predictors of decision-makers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> older <b>people</b> and whether these relationships are moderated by intergenerational contact frequency and quality. Design/methodology/approach. The authors tested the hypotheses using data from 232 employees with hiring power. Findings. Results indicate that intergroup anxiety was negatively related to decision-makers’ willingness <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> older <b>people.</b> Further, intergenerational contact frequency exacerbated the relationship between intergroup anxiety and willingness <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> older people; whereas intergenerational contact quality buffered the negative relationship. In addition, the authors found that intergenerational contact quality facilitated the positive relationship between perceived outgroup competence and willingness <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> older <b>people.</b> Originality/value. These findings extend previous research on older worker employment. In particular, they demonstrate how intergenerational contact frequency and quality can be powerful means that influence age-related hiring decisions...|$|R

Our forefathers had, on the whole, to take care of themselves; we find it more convenient <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>people</b> to take care of us. So much the better for us, in some respects; but, it may be, so much the worse in others. So much the better; because, as usually results from the division of labour, these people, having little or nothing to do save to take care of us, do so far better than we could; and so prevent a vast amount of violence and wrong, and therefore of misery, especially to the weak; for which last reason we will acquiesce in the existence of policemen and lawyers, as we do in the results of arbitration, as the lesser of two evils. The odds in war are in favour of the bigger bully, in arbitration in favour of the bigger rogue; and it is a question whether the lion or the fox be the safer guardian of human interests. But arbitration prevents war; and that, in three cases out of four, is full reason for employing it.|$|E
