40|$|In Vietnam, {{the history}} of cities can easily be seen through their urban patterns, landscapes and housing typologies. Most recently, the {{economic}} reform in 1986 has resulted in huge impact on the Vietnamese society. The rapid economic growth and privatisation of the market {{has resulted in the}} appearance and significant development of the “new tube house” which soon became the most dominant housing type in Vietnam. Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, has a long history and also is very rich in architectural styles and typologies which are reflected in its urban pattern. However, there is no actual clear boundary in urban scale as the new <b>tube</b> <b>houses</b> are scattered all over the city and they are adapted differently to the contexts.

5000|$|Hollow Flashlight {{utilizes}} the thermoelectric {{effect to}} convert radiant body heat into electricity to power an LED bulb {{without the need}} for batteries or kinetic energy. Consisting only of a PVC <b>tube</b> <b>housing,</b> aluminum tube, Peltier tiles, and the circuit, Makosinki managed to source the materials for her prototype for $26. Applying the hand to one side of Peltier tiles while ambient air cools the other side, enough energy is generated to light several LED bulbs. She developed two working prototypes. At 5 °C temperature gradient, they produce 3 and 4 foot-candles of light, respectively. At 10 °C temperature gradient, they produce 4 and 5 foot-candles of light, respectively. At 10 °C ambient temperature, the flastlight maintains a steady beam of light for over 20 minutes. She has since made improvements to the device including the ability to store harvested electricity, adapted into a wearable headlamp, and has garnered interest for commercial production. The device can now provide over 6 lux of light at a distance of 12 inches and can provide on-demand light for 60 minutes without body contact. The [...] "hollow flashlight" [...] was inspired after learning that a friend living in the Philippines struggled in school without any light to study at night and no time during daylight-hours.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective <b>tube</b> <b>housing,</b> as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its maximum rated continuous current for its maximum rated operating voltage. From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective <b>tube</b> <b>housing.</b> As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|E

Air kerma measurements were carried out with an ionisation chamber positioned against the X-ray tube to obtain the total filtration attenuation characteristics. The framework is applicable to bowtie and non-bowtie inherent filtrations, and it accounts for the anode heel effect and the total filtration of the <b>tube</b> <b>housing.</b> The code was adjusted to the Promax 3 D Max (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) dental CBCT scanner.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experimental study is to compare the effects of various materials obstructing the flow of a blast wave {{and the ability of}} the given material to reduce the damage caused by the blast. Several methods of energy transfer in blast wave flows are known or expected including: material interfaces with impedance mismatches, density changes in a given material, internal shearing, and particle fracture. The theory applied to this research is that the greatest energy transfer within the obstructing material will yield the greatest mitigation effects to the blast. Sample configurations of foam were varied to introduce material interfaces and filler materials with varying densities and impedances (liquids and powders). The samples were loaded according to a small scale blast produced by an explosive driven shock <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> gram-range charges.

40|$|The {{most common}} scheme for the phonetic {{classification}} of consonants {{is the one}} embodied in the IPA chart. Consonants are classified along three dimensions: voicing, place of articulation and manner of articulation. In this paper the adequacy of these dimensions for the classification of sounds described as pharyngeals will be critically examined {{in the light of}} evidence from instrumental phonetic studies and {{from the perspective of the}} descriptive framework offered by Esling’s ‘laryngeal articulator ’ model (Esling 1999). The difficulty of specifying passive and active articulators, and Catford’s (1977 : 140) alternatives of ‘upper ’ and ‘lower ’ articulators, will be discussed. The IPA chart specifies ‘pharyngeal ’ as a place of articulation between uvular and glottal. However, this ‘place’, the pharynx, is not so much a specific location the way that dental and alveolar are, but rather a tubular section of the vocal tract whose length and width can be considerably altered during speech. It contains structures whose inter-relationships are not fully understood. These include the faucal pillars, the tongue root, the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, the epilaryngeal <b>tube</b> <b>housing</b> the ventricular bands, and of course the pharyngeal walls themselves.

40|$|The double crystal x-ray {{spectrometer}} is {{distinctly different}} in principle from the single crystal spectrometer and calls therefore for {{a completely new}} design rather than an adaptation of single spectrometer design. One such new design is described in this paper. Emphasis is laid {{on the fact that}} the wave-length selected by the process of two successive crystal reflections in any prescribed orders depends solely on the dihedral angle between the crystals. The advantages of rotating both crystals in equal and opposite directions with respect to a plane through their axes of rotation are pointed out and a spectrometer designed to accomplish this is described. In this spectrometer the turning of a single shaft drives the two crystals, the spectrometer as a whole and the x-ray tube, at the proper angular rates about the proper centers to insure that the x-ray beam will at all times remain centered on the crystal faces and the window of the stationary ion chamber.
