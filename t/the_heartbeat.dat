5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Heartbeat</b> Extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) {{protocols}} {{was proposed}} {{as a standard}} in February 2012 by RFC 6520. It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule Münster, implemented <b>the</b> <b>Heartbeat</b> Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put {{the result of his}} work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. The defect spread with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat,</b> may also accompany TBI.|$|E

25|$|In AF, {{the normal}} regular {{electrical}} impulses {{generated by the}} sinoatrial node in the right atrium of the heart are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses usually originating in {{the roots of the}} pulmonary veins. This leads to irregular conduction of ventricular impulses that generate <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oscilloscopes {{are used}} in the sciences, medicine, engineering, {{automotive}} and the telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat</b> as an electrocardiogram.|$|E
25|$|Impedance cardiography (often {{abbreviated}} as ICG, or Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance (TEB)) measures {{changes in}} electrical impedance across the thoracic region over the cardiac cycle. Lower impedance indicates greater intrathoracic fluid volume and blood flow. By synchronizing fluid volume changes with <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat,</b> {{the change in}} impedance {{can be used to}} calculate stroke volume, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.|$|E

25|$|The Maze procedure, first {{performed}} in 1987, {{is an effective}} invasive surgical treatment {{that is designed to}} create electrical blocks or barriers in the atria of the heart, forcing electrical impulses that stimulate <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat</b> to travel down to the ventricles. The idea is to force abnormal electrical signals to move along one, uniform path to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles), thus restoring the normal heart rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Heart rate is {{the speed}} of <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat</b> {{measured}} {{by the number of}} contractions of the heart per minute (bpm). The heart rate can vary according to the body's physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide. It is usually equal or close to the pulse measured at any peripheral point. Activities that can provoke change include physical exercise, sleep, anxiety, stress, illness, and ingestion of drugs.|$|E
25|$|The rhythmic {{electrical}} depolarization {{waves that}} trigger myocardial contraction is myogenic, {{which means that}} they begin in the heart muscle spontaneously and are then responsible for transmitting signals from cell to cell. Myocytes that were obtained in the primitive heart tube, start beating as they connect together by their walls in a syncytium. Myocytes initiate rhythmic electrical activity, before the fusion of the endocardial tubes. <b>The</b> <b>heartbeat</b> begins in the region of the pacemaker which has a spontaneous depolarization time faster than the rest of myocardium.|$|E
25|$|Some Sufi orders {{stress and}} place {{extensive}} reliance upon Dhikr.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Heartbeats</b> {{originally}} {{performed at}} parties for their medical colleagues.  As the band became known around Houston, {{they were asked}} to perform at larger social events that were fundraisers for the Texas Heart Institute and other medical institutions in Houston, as well as for organizations that support the arts, such as the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston.  The band most commonly performed a short (about 30 minutes) set during the event.  Working as such, <b>The</b> <b>Heartbeats</b> shared <b>the</b> bandstand with some of Houston’s top dance bands.|$|R
50|$|The {{group was}} formed by Barry Langtree and Kevin Heywood in the mid-1950s, then known as <b>The</b> <b>Heartbeats.</b> They {{included}} vocalist, Tommy Hart, drummer Pete Yeoman, bassist Roger Goodier and became Tommy Hart & <b>The</b> <b>Heartbeats.</b> They were spotted by BBC radio scouts and recorded alongside the Northern Dance Orchestra. Once Hart left the group, they became Barry Langtree & The Lancastrians, and recruited two new members, Terry Benson on bass and John Fleury on drums.

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of tinnitus is usually {{based on the}} person's description. A number of questionnaires exist that may help to assess how much tinnitus is interfering with a person's life. The diagnosis is commonly supported by an audiogram and a neurological examination. If certain problems are found, medical imaging, such as with MRI, may be performed. Other tests are suitable when tinnitus occurs with the same rhythm as <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat.</b> Rarely, the sound may be heard by someone else using a stethoscope, in which case it is known as objective tinnitus. Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, which are sounds produced normally by the inner ear, may also occasionally result in tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|After {{about ten}} weeks of gestational age, the embryo becomes {{known as a}} fetus. At the {{beginning}} of the fetal stage, the risk of miscarriage decreases sharply. At this stage, a fetus is about 30mm (1.2inches) in length, <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat</b> is seen via ultrasound, and the fetus makes involuntary motions. During continued fetal development, the early body systems, and structures that were established in the embryonic stage continue to develop. Sex organs begin to appear during the third month of gestation. The fetus continues to grow in both weight and length, although the majority of the physical growth occurs in the last weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|The up {{and down}} {{fluctuation}} of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat.</b> Pulse pressure {{is determined by the}} interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial system—largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries—and the resistance to flow in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant. The loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.|$|E
25|$|The Opening Ceremony {{culminated in}} the end of the torch relay, a {{tradition}} begun when Berlin hosted the games in 1936.

Actors, suspended on cables, started rising out of the crowd and ran towards the globe, carrying glowing sticks meant to simulate the Olympic torch. On the globe, the names of the cities which the torch visited were projected, and this segment ended with all the torchbearers floating mid-air coming together at the globe. After this segment ended, the lights were dimmed, and the sound of <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat</b> accompanied by thunderous cheers and applause met the torch's final arrival to the Olympic Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Saint Mechtilde of Helfta (d.1298) {{became an}} ardent devotee and {{promoter}} of Jesus’ heart {{after it was}} the subject of many of her visions. The idea of hearing <b>the</b> <b>heartbeat</b> of God was very important to medieval saints who nurtured devotion to the Sacred Heart. Mechtilde reported that Jesus appeared to her in a vision and commanded her to love Him ardently, and to honor his sacred heart in the Blessed Sacrament as much as possible. He gave her his heart as a pledge of his love, as a place of refuge during her life and as her consolation at the hour of her death. From this time Mechtilde had an extraordinary devotion for the Sacred Heart, and said that if she had to write down all the favors and all the blessings which she had received by means of this devotion, a large book would not contain them.|$|E
