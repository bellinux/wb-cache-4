The establishment of a <b>traceability</b> <b>chain</b> in materials metrology is, however, difficult because the measurement of materials properties is commonly procedure-dependent.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} Several {{different}} perspectives exist {{on the importance of}} food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> and why it is scientifically investigated. These include the assessment of food security and quality preservation, economic, logistic, supply chain management, and information technical. Because of this, the concept of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> is defined in many different ways, depending on the scientific area of the research perspective used for investigation. This makes the concept and the scientific value of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> sometimes hard to understand theoretically. Thus, it is of great importance to position the concept theoretically and in relation to other scientific research areas. The purpose {{of this paper}} is to examine how food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> can be theoretically positioned in academic supply chain research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a literature review of definitions and perspectives of food supply traceability, and of the concepts and definitions used within the paradigm thinking found in relevant scientific articles and books. Findings: The results show that food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> is pre-paradigm research and further suggests that it should be treated as a “physical representational space” in scientific theory. The results also verify that food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> is a complex research field, which is studied by using several perspectives in different research areas, especially logistics. It is important to clarify the perspective that has been applied when making suggestions concerning logistics development. Research limitations/implications: The literature review only includes definitions and methods for positioning food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> from a scientific theoretical perspective. The study excludes the concepts “track and trace”, “internal traceability” and “external traceability”, which are used in food supply chain management. Practical implications: The results of this paper are useful for practitioners as well as researchers since it addresses and aims to explain the concept of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> from a scientific perspective. This should influence future supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> setups. What is original/value of paper: The paper provides an extended understanding of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> in relation to scientific theory in a new unique way that can influence future research in and development of the area, particularly concerning societal perspectives...|$|R

40|$|Traceability in {{food supply}} chains has {{received}} increased {{attention in the}} last decade. The efforts of governmental authorities have also increased to regulate and control food supply chains and product characteristics related to information to ensure safety, quality, and preservation of living resources. Previous studies in the area take an industrial focus and exclude the governmental authority focus. This thesis thus focuses on exploring governmental authority and industrial effects on traceability in food supply chains. The purpose is to extend the traceability capabilities in food supply chains that are influenced by governmental authorities. The thesis reports findings from literature reviews and case studies that investigated three research questions. The first question embraces different perspectives of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> in supply <b>chain</b> management (SCM) literature, {{as well as the}} science theoretical perspective of food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability.</b> The second question explores modelling techniques for mapping food supply chains based on two dimensional flows of information between a governmental authority and actors, and of the flows of physical goods in three fresh food supply chains. The third question concerns the effects on operational activities and traceability information in fresh food supply chains by implementing the RFID based smart goods concept. The results show that food supply <b>chain</b> <b>traceability</b> is a multidisciplinary concept which is important for governmental authorities. Supply chain management techniques for mapping descriptive information flows and for capturing information in supply chains are applicable to improve traceability in fresh food supply chains.

Because {{of their potential}} health impacts {{on a wide variety}} of biota, including human beings, they belong to the twelve classes of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) selected by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) under the Stockholm Convention on POPs in 1997. For this reason, the European Community requires the development of measurement methods and standards in order to obtain comparable, consistent, reliable and high quality results for the measurements of these kinds of compounds. The present work deals with the establishment of a <b>traceability</b> <b>chain</b> for the analysis of various PCBs congeners in organic solutions. Traceability is the property of the result of a measurement or the value of a standard whereby it can be related to stated references, usually national or international standards, through an unbroken chain of comparison all having stated uncertainties. The unbroken chain of comparisons is called <b>traceability</b> <b>chain.</b> A correct <b>traceability</b> <b>chain</b> needs to be established in order to obtain high quality reliable results and to compare results of measurements carried out in different places and by different laboratories. Traceable PCBs standards in iso-octane were prepared by accurate weighings from certified reference materials; an uncertainty budget was made, which took into account all the possible uncertainty sources, as the uncertainty of the reference materials and the uncertainty in the mass measurements. Various PCBs congeners were determined via gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry. The identification of the PCBs congeners in different organic solutions was made by means of the interpretation of the mass spectra obtained in the scan mode.
