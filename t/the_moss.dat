5|$|Chat Moss {{makes up}} the largest area of prime {{farmland}} in Greater Manchester, but farming on <b>the</b> <b>moss</b> is in decline. In 2003, {{it was reported that}} of the 54farms on <b>the</b> <b>moss,</b> occupying , almost half the area of the bog, only three were growing vegetables. Others had turned to arable farming, turf growing or horse livery instead of salad and vegetable crops. Chat Moss also contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Salta, and <b>the</b> <b>Moss</b> in particular, {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of plant and animal life, {{including}} some rare specimens. Adders, Britain's only native venomous snake, are seen on <b>the</b> <b>Moss,</b> and prey upon small rodents, such as voles. Many wild bird species inhabit Salta and the surrounding area, including larger species such as pheasants, which are also bred locally for hunting.|$|E
5|$|All nuthatches nest in cavities; {{except for}} the two species of rock nuthatches, all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with soft {{materials}} on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining consists of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes <b>the</b> <b>moss,</b> grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|E
50|$|Rhytidiadeplus loreusis {{is similar}} to many {{contrasting}} species of moss. It {{is considered to be}} part of <b>the</b> feather <b>moss</b> species. <b>The</b> species that is the most similar hail from the Rhytidiadelphus and Kinbergia genera. Two plants in particular are <b>the</b> Bent- leaf <b>moss</b> and <b>the</b> Goose-necked <b>moss.</b> <b>The</b> goose-necked <b>moss's</b> branches do not grow to the same height as <b>the</b> Lanky <b>Moss</b> branches. <b>The</b> Kindbergia species that is located in British Columbia is different compared to the Ryhytidiadeplus loreusis because of its smaller size with a complex branch structure.The Oregon Beaked Moss or Kindbergia oregana is a yellow- light green moss compared to Lanky Moss and grows in a similar loose mat structure. <b>The</b> Oregon Beaked <b>Moss</b> is similarly a coastal moss species and grows at similar elevations on decaying logs or in an epiphytic manner like <b>the</b> Lanky <b>Moss.</b> Its major difference is that it is more contained and regular in its growth patterns compared to <b>the</b> Lanky <b>Moss.</b> <b>The</b> Slender Beaked <b>Moss</b> or Kindbergia praelonga is also like <b>the</b> Lanky <b>Moss</b> because of its irregularity in structure and growth.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, mosses {{were grouped}} with the liverworts and hornworts in the {{division}} Bryophyta (bryophytes, or Bryophyta sensu lato), within which <b>the</b> <b>mosses</b> made up <b>the</b> class Musci. This definition of Bryophyta, however, was paraphyletic, and is now split into three divisions, Bryophyta, Marchantiophyta and Anthocerotophyta. Currently, the division Bryophyta contains only <b>the</b> <b>mosses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Preindustrial {{societies}} {{made use}} of <b>the</b> <b>mosses</b> growing in their areas.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moss</b> {{contains}} several {{varieties of}} heather, {{as well as}} the purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. Ferns and gorse are common too, and in areas where peat has been cut in the past, there are bog mosses, the bog bean Menyanthus trifoliata, and marsh pennywort.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been cut}} with {{irrigation}} channels, and been {{the site of}} burning and peat working, Salta Moss has different flora than other bogs or mires on the Solway Plain. <b>The</b> <b>Moss</b> today is common ground, but a track runs through it to provide access for local farmers to outlying fields, which surround it. An irrigation ditch has also been dug to provide drainage to the surrounding farmland.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{properties}} in Salta is known to date from the 16th century, and the hamlet has been continually inhabited ever since. During the Second World War, 43 evacuees from the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne area were billeted to the parish of Holme St. Cuthbert, and several ended up in Salta. Development in the 20th century saw new houses built, but mainline water and electricity arrived later than {{in other parts of}} Britain, perhaps due to the small population. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside, beyond <b>the</b> <b>Moss</b> to the southeast of Salta, were conducted in 1989–1990 by Robert H. Bewley.|$|E

50|$|Takakia is a genus of {{two species}} of mosses known from western North America and central and eastern Asia. The genus is placed as a {{separate}} family, order and class among <b>the</b> <b>mosses.</b> It has {{had a history of}} uncertain placement, but the discovery of sporophytes clearly of the moss-type firmly supports placement with <b>the</b> <b>mosses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Salta {{can only}} be {{accessed}} from the lane from Mawbray, which goes on to join the B5300 coast road, although two public bridleways provide access over the fields from Hailforth and Mawbray. The hamlet consists of mainly bungalows, and a farm is still in operation in the vicinity. A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across <b>the</b> <b>Moss</b> to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of Edderside.|$|E
5|$|There is {{some concern}} that areas of <b>the</b> <b>Moss</b> {{have been damaged}} or partly {{destroyed}} {{as a result of}} agricultural activity, including the digging of drainage ditches. Natural England, the agency responsible for the management of SSSIs in England, has suggested that no further irrigation channels should be dug, existing ones should not be deepened, and that the area should not be exposed to fertilisers or surface water run-off. Natural England further notes that the site's continued status as an SSSI depends on maintaining a high water table.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from <b>the</b> <b>moss</b> or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons Johnson {{featured}} intermittently in the first team. He scored five goals in 12 appearances for the first team in 1920–21, playing more regularly for the reserves, for whom he was the leading goalscorer with 18 goals. He became a regular first team selection in 1922–23, playing 35 matches. In 1923 Manchester City moved from Hyde Road to a new stadium, Maine Road, in <b>the</b> <b>Moss</b> Side area of the city. Johnson scored in the first match at the new stadium, against Sheffield United. While Johnson was a regular goalscorer {{at this point in}} his career, he did not score as frequently as teammates Frank Roberts and Horace Barnes. Firmly established in the first team, he missed only one match in the 1924–25 season.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. <b>The</b> <b>moss</b> and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
5|$|Temperature: The species {{appears to}} require the cool, mild {{temperatures}} and relatively constant conditions provided by the waterfalls and the mist they generate. Water volume and flow rates within the Chittenango Creek watershed influence {{the size of the}} waterfall as well as the mist-zone and the actual temperature at the site. Active Novisuccinea chittenangoensis are generally found at temperatures from 12 to 20°C. During warmer periods, snails retreat to cool areas provided by the moist rock and moss, or aestivate in the vegetation. During cold winter temperatures, it is believed that the snails at the Falls retreat into cracks or fissures in the rocks and remain inactive. Various temperature readings were gathered during the summers of 1980-1982. In the spray zone, the rock surface temperatures averaged 16°C, <b>the</b> <b>moss</b> averaged 14°C, and the combined temperatures of the substrate, water, and vegetation averaged 16°C. Seasonal and daily temperature variation has been monitored for 2 years using data loggers that record temperature every hour, but this data has not yet been analyzed (Breisch, unpublished data).|$|E
