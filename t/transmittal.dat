40|$|Abstract: Meaningful {{interoperability}} between physics-based models {{requires a}} common understanding and stan-dardized {{description of the}} physical laws governing physical objects, i. e., an ontology of physics and the resulting metadata. For example, currently, the Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specifica-tion (SEDRIS) standard addresses the description of model data objects, their spatiotemporal coordinates, and many physical attributes. What is not described in SEDRIS are model dynamics, i. e., how a model evolves in time between the discrete states that are represented in <b>transmittals.</b> If model dynamics are not specified with the data, a data recipient {{will be required to}} infer how he/she should use the received data, making an inference that will vary depending on the recipient. Of the many factors that may affect model dynamics, such as military doctrine, human behavior, or physics, we focus on representing physical dynamics. This is commonly a necessary aspect of model dynamics. The key concepts in representing physical dynamics are the equations of physics, usually phrased as differential equations, and how they relate to static representations of physical objects, such as those represented in SEDRIS. This paper frames the structure of how to incorporate considerations of dynamics in an ontology of physics and begins to detail the types of physical dynamical relationships that may be modeled. ...|$|R

In response the Executive Secretary recommended and the Group endorsed an interim review after two years to check up on progress. In what was cited as a ground breaking step, the review included an appraisal of the organizational culture of ICARDA, and contained recommendations for influencing the culture toward a more problem-solving approach.

The panel suggested that IITA should have a global mandate for research in high rainfall, low altitude tropics. There was a danger that too much identification with Nigeria, or even a region of Africa, might invite political interference. The panel believed that IITA should have the CGIAR mandate for soybeans, starchy bananas, and cocoyams. TAC joined the panel in citing research progress on breeding cassava varieties resistant to diseases, biological control of cassava pests, weevil resistant sweet potatoes, improved methods for propagating yams, short duration varieties of cowpea, and genetic resistance to maize streak virus. TAC recommended that IITA should decentralize its activities more beyond its host country. TAC saw IITA's mandate as involving work on farming systems and crops for which it held secondary responsibilities in the humid and sub-humid areas only, and work on its primary mandate crops, cowpeas, yams, and sweet potatoes, in collaboration with other centers on a global basis...|$|R

Work on the priorities and strategies paper began at TAC 66 in March 1995, and continued until the paper was made final at TAC 72 in March 1997.

In its final paper, TAC emphasized the goals of poverty alleviation, natural resource conservation, alternative sources of supply of CGIAR products, and the likelihood of success. The paper includes annexes defining CGIAR activities, describing the methodologies used, and providing an overview of production sectors and commodities. At TAC 72, the Committee approved the allocation to centers for the period.

The plan was to be revised under the new director general. The panel commented on mandate, strategy and research priorities, and reviewed the work of the bean, cassava, rice and tropical pastures programs. It also considered supporting research and other services, and discussed seven selected themes of CIAT research. Other sections of the report dealt with international cooperation, training and communications. A chapter on organizational structure and process was prepared jointly with the EMR panel. Recommendations concern, among other things, the screening and processing of backlogged bean germplasm materials; identification of major constraints to bean production in Africa; establishment of an internal biosafety committee; population improvement and yield measurement methodologies used by the rice program; increased fund raising for the seed unit, and appointment of a Coordinator of Research Support...|$|R
25|$|As {{passed by}} Congress, FATCA {{was meant to}} {{form the basis for}} a {{relationship}} between the U.S. Department of the Treasury and individual FFI's. Personnel at some FFIs responded by asserting, however, that it was not possible for the FFIs to follow their own countries' laws (privacy, confidentiality, discrimination, etc.) and simultaneously to comply with FATCA as is. Discussions from financial industry lobbyists resulted in the creation of Intergovernmental Agreements (IGA's) between the Executive Branch of the United States government with foreign governments. This development resulted in foreign governments to implement the US FATCA requirements into their own legal systems, which in turn allowed those governments to change their privacy and discrimination laws to allow the identification and reporting of US persons via those governments. In an IGA, a government agrees that all of its financial institutions shall comply with FATCA (whereas without the IGA each FFI {{would have been able to}} decide if it were to comply with FATCA or not). With the IGA's, the private data of suspected US persons would be collected and handled by the FFI's, whereas the many governments would then collect and store that data for further <b>transmittal.</b> The IGA added the applicable government to the list of handlers of the data.|$|E

The document contains {{a summary of the}} CGIAR discussion of the two reviews at its meeting of October-November 1988, a TAC commentary, ICARDA's response, <b>transmittals</b> from the chairmen of the panel and TAC, and the conclusions and recommendations of the EMR. The report was discussed at TAC 46. The review characterized ICARDA as a firmly established and mature IARC with visible and accumulating impact on national programs in the Middle East and North Africa Region. Reviewers called for ICARDA's strategic plan to be more explicit, with more analysis underpinning proposed decision making and priority setting in the center's future program. Increased research is suggested on winter rainfall farming systems, water harvesting and supplemental irrigation, and efficiency of water use. The panel endorsed the focus on lentils because of their importance as livestock feed and in human diets. Members recommended stopping faba bean improvement research and reducing work on food legumes, increased staffing of socioeconomic research (including a full time social anthropologist), and increased livestock research. Linkages with basic research institutions and establishment of a biotechnology laboratory were encouraged with the caveat that such upstream work be needs-driven and problem-oriented. There were several joint recommendations with the EMR panel.

Review Panel recommendations include: greater attention by the board to performing all its critical functions, and improvement of its internal structure and procedures; appointment of a deputy director general for research and training; establishment of a management committee headed by the director general; strengthening the accountability and performance evaluation criteria for units and individuals; developing a project-based management and budget system; international recruitment of a Human Resources Officer; relieving the financial burden on national staff resulting from the depressed state of the Mexican economy; adopting a fund raising strategy; and increasing the prominence of the internal audit function.

With the development of activities in Sub Saharan Africa, ICRISAT had become the largest CGIAR center. The EPR panel noted that information on impact in Africa was still largely anecdotal, and recommended more attention to impact assessment. It encouraged emphasis on soil-related problems of sustainability, and supported the trend toward strategic research. Emphasis on plant protection and integrated pest management was appropriate. More attention should be given to {{the role of women in}} agriculture. The EMR panel noted favorable results from the decentralization of management. It recommended a joint study by ICRISAT and Indian research institutions on the future of their mutual endeavors, although relations were presently good. It also suggested a project management system for research. The faster turnover of international as compared to national scientists was creating an undesirable age spread between these groups. The EMR contained suggestions for improved coordination among CGIAR centers in the SADCC region, and improved NARS inputs to the ICRISAT Sahelian Center [...] TAC urged greater clarity on priorities and future activities in the next draft of the strategic plan.
