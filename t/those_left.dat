5|$|Jews were a {{significant}} {{minority in the}} Byzantine state throughout its history, and, according to Roman law, they constituted a legally recognised religious group. In the early Byzantine period they were generally tolerated, but then periods of tensions and persecutions ensued. In any case, after the Arab conquests, the majority of Jews found themselves outside the Empire; <b>those</b> <b>left</b> inside the Byzantine borders apparently lived in relative peace from the 10th century onwards.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, Hanover, Saint Elizabeth, Saint James, and Westmoreland parishes were {{considered}} disaster areas. A task force {{was established by}} the Prime Minister Michael Manley for reconstruction efforts. About 7,758families, a total of 36,391people, required assistance with food supplies for over 13weeks. The Housing Task Force called {{for the construction of}} 582new houses, 300of which for <b>those</b> <b>left</b> homeless. The houses constructed for the people rendered homeless were prefabricated by the Ministry of Housing and then erected by the local authorities, under the guidance of the Ministry of Local Government. In response to the disaster, the Government of Jamaica established the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management in July1980.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized {{loss of life}} along the coast. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone. A total of 586homes were damaged there. Just outside {{the city in the}} Hinthada District, a flash flood killed at least 18people. Overall, the storm claimed 37lives in the country and left US$6.7million in damage. In the wake of Mala, the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house <b>those</b> <b>left</b> homeless. Government and social organizations donated 5.4million kyat (US$4,320) in cash to survivors in the Ayeyarwady Region.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. <b>Those</b> <b>left</b> behind {{had to make it}} appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 two thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E

40|$|There {{are only}} a small number of studies on the health effects of {{involuntary}} unemployment (e. g., downsizing), and results are contradictory. The authors studied the mortality through 2002 of 13, 370 Pan American World Airways employees who were born before 1940 and whose records were available after the company’s bankruptcy in 1991. The cohort was divided into <b>those</b> who <b>left</b> work voluntarily (55 %), involuntarily (39 %), and because of illness (6 %). The mean year of first employment was 1963, the mean year of last employment was 1987, and the mean age at leaving the company was 55 years. Of <b>those</b> who <b>left</b> involuntarily, 56 % left at the time of bankruptcy in December 1991 or later. Twenty-two percent of the cohort died during follow-up, which began at the time of leaving the company. Standardized mortality ratios relative to the US population for all causes for <b>those</b> who <b>left</b> voluntarily, involuntarily, and because of illness were 0. 72 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 69, 0. 76), 0. 69 (95 %CI: 0. 65, 0. 74), and 2. 40 (95 % CI: 2. 22, 2. 60), respectively. Ischemic heart disease mortality showed a similar pattern. Internal analyses comparing involuntary to voluntary leavers after adjusting for age, race, sex, calendar time, and education yielded all-cause and ischemic heart disease rate ratios of 0. 96 (95 % CI: 0. 87, 1. 07) and 1. 11 (95 % CI: 0. 93, 1. 35), respectively. Subanalyses of <b>those</b> who <b>left</b> involuntarily at age 60 years, or <b>those</b> who <b>left</b> involuntarily at the time of bankruptcy, did not indicate any excess mortality (all-cause standardized mortality ratios 0. 69 and 0. 64, respectively).

Queen especially was badly damaged and unable to make the British lines again, wallowing between the newly reformed French fleet and the British battleline along with several other shattered ships.(Manderson served as a lieutenant aboard HMS Queen) Royal George and Glory had between them disabled Scipion and Sans Pareil in a bitter exchange, but were also too badly damaged themselves to take possession.

5|$|Around {{this central}} motif are {{arranged}} elements of eight other stories, {{all of them}} represented {{at least in part}} by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as <b>those</b> <b>left</b> by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri.

5|$|Call of Duty 2 is a first-person shooter {{that has}} a single-player story mode and a {{multiplayer}} mode. The player takes on the roles of several Allied protagonists in specific missions during World War II. The player can crouch and lie prone, {{and is able to}} scale low walls and other obstacles. Two firearms can be carried, which can be swapped with <b>those</b> <b>left</b> on the battlefield, and both fragmentation and smoke grenades can also be carried. A gun's iron sights can be used to aim more accurately. A compass on the heads-up display (HUD) shows both allies and enemies, and objective markers to indicate locations the player must reach, areas to defend, or enemy cannons or tanks that the player must plant explosives on to disable. Emplaced weapons such as machine guns and flak cannons are available in some locations to take out enemy troops. In addition, some missions place the player in control of a tank.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports from}} Nukuʻalofa on December31 {{indicated}} severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses. Following {{the passage of}} Waka, communication with Niuas and Vava'u were lost. According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly every tree. Surveys by the Red Cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and <b>those</b> <b>left</b> standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, yams and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest {{brought on by the}} storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs. In one instance, a yacht was brought onshore by the surge and crashed into a restaurant, destroying both.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{residents}} across Guam {{were critical}} of the delayed response by the U.S. government; no aid had arrived within two days of the storm, but unsafe conditions at airports had prevented aircraft from landing. With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam, structures that remained standing were used as temporary shelter for <b>those</b> <b>left</b> homeless. Similarly, damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians. By November14, the USS Daniel I. Sultan arrived in Guam with 1,100troops to provide emergency power. A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies. About 400troops and 80public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November14. The Red Cross and civil defense offices were placed in charge of coordinating recovery efforts. Water distribution centers were set up across the island to provide residents with clean drinking water.|$|E

5|$|Judging {{relationships}} {{based on}} shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently. Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation {{similar to those}} of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or <b>those</b> <b>left</b> over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} this style of warfare was a level of {{casualties}} unknown in previous conflicts. Approximately 2 million Germans and 1.3 million Frenchmen died during the war; 720,000 British soldiers died, along with 61,000 Canadian, 60,000 Australian and 18,000 New Zealand servicemen. On the Eastern front, 300,000 Romanians alone died. The war had a global impact, and at least 2,000 Chinese died in the European theatre of the conflict alone. Many of the deaths occurred within {{a short period of}} time, or affected particular groups: half of France's casualties occurred during the first 17 months of the war, for example, while the French middle and upper classes suffered disproportionate losses. Many of those who survived were injured {{in the course of the}} fighting; some injuries, such as facial traumas, resulted in the victim being shunned by wider society and banned from public events. These losses also left large numbers of widows and orphans – 1.36 m in France alone – and affected most families in some way: in Australia, every second family had lost a relative. Even <b>those</b> <b>left</b> at home had suffered extensively from stress, anxiety and grief.|$|E
5|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{rational}} nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from <b>those</b> <b>left</b> outside the group. To satisfy the second stage, {{there must be a}} discernible basis of classification. All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against. Examples of such features include gender, age, race, religion, seniority of professional qualification and area of residence. Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship. Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself, but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects, does not constitute classification. If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently, the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid. If there is an intelligible differentia, the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage.|$|E

5|$|While moving northward off {{the coast}} of Florida, Irene was {{initially}} expected to make landfall along the South Carolina coastline, prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue a Hurricane Warning from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Because of this, voluntary evacuation orders were issued for portions of South Carolina. However, when the track shifted further to the east, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for coastal areas of North Carolina, with tens of thousands removed from their homes. The evacuation order included several beach towns; those living in low-lying areas and mobile homes were advised to seek shelter. In addition, many of <b>those</b> <b>left</b> homeless from Hurricane Floyd's passage just weeks before were evacuated to shelters. Jim Hunt, the Governor of North Carolina, declared a state of emergency, with the state's emergency management team switching from a recovery objective towards a preparations mission.|$|E
5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III, {{the events of}} which have killed off much of the population; <b>those</b> <b>left</b> alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the {{survivors}} have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels {{from town to town}} in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing the voice on the other end, the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx.
