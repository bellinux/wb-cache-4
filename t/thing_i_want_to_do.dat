500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E

Listening to someone play the guitar is the very last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> right now!" [...] But he kept insisting {{and he ended up}} playing the record for me. I told him I thought it was really good and then he said, [...] "You know, the guy's only playing with two fingers on his {{fretboard}} hand because of an injury he sustained in a terrible fire." [...] I was totally knocked back by this revelation and was so impressed by what I had just heard that I suddenly became inspired to start trying to play again.|$|E
2500|$|As the Belmont Stakes {{was held}} only 12 {{days after the}} Met Mile, Croll elected to bypass it to focus on races later in the year. [...] "The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is {{jeopardize}} his future," [...] he said. Holy Bull returned in the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park on July 3, where he faced only three rivals. Once again, {{he went to the}} early lead then pulled away in the stretch to win by [...] lengths. [...] "He's an amazing horse," [...] said Croll, who had shipped Holy Bull in from Monmouth Park {{on the day of the}} race. [...] "This morning, getting on the van, he knew exactly where he was going. If I hadn't put him on the van, he'd have been disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, she {{had become}} tired of the rape themes and school-girl roles which were common in her videos, but she enjoyed {{the fact that she was}} getting more {{dominant}} roles in her later AVs. [...] "Making men play along to me is something new so it's fun to do. I think that's the type of <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more of." [...] Nozomi's July, 2002 video release, Popular Actresses Fucking Virgin Boys, was in this genre. As the title implied, the video had Nozomi and two other AV actresses have sex with amateur virgin males, including a college student and a middle-aged man. Her video Home Delivery Call Girl, from August 2002, worked with a similar documentary-style concept. In this case, the actress appears at a male amateur's home to perform sex with him. A posthumously-released compilation DVD released by CineMagic from 2006, entitled La Vie En Nose, includes one of Nozomi's videos from 2002. This was the first in a series of DVDs focusing on a nose fetish, indicating that Nozomi had worked in that genre also.|$|E

5000|$|In 1972, {{independent}} {{production company}} Kelly-Jordan Enterprises approached William Gunn, an African-American artist {{known at the}} time primarily as a playwright and stage director, {{with the idea of}} making a [...] "black vampire" [...] film with a budget of $350,000. Though Gunn later told a friend, [...] "the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is make a black vampire film," [...] he accepted the project with the intention of using vampirism as metaphor for addiction.
