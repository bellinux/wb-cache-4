TMC is an autonomous ‘Civic Body’ under the municipal charter granted in 2003, as per the Bhutan Municipal Act of 1999.

25|$|<b>Thimphu</b> was {{selected}} to be the capital of Bhutan in 1952 but was not officially established as capital of Bhutan until 1961. It was then a hamlet of a few houses built, around the Tashichhoe Dzong. The city has expanded slowly over the years along river banks and on high ground. Lower plains along the river have also been occupied. It was only after the country was opened for foreign visitors that it grew rapidly. <b>Thimphu</b> is now a city of 91,000 people. The city has all civic amenities such as well planned wide roads with traffic police controlling the traffic, banks, hotels and restaurants, institutions of arts, culture, media, sports and also the traditional dzongs, monasteries and chortens. Consequently, a boom in property value in <b>Thimphu</b> has been reported.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} in the 1960s that roads were built in Bhutan and <b>Thimphu</b> when the Third King of Bhutan took the {{initiative}} after receiving education in it. Prior to that, education was limited to monastic teachings in monasteries, except for a few privileged people who went to Darjeeling to receive western-type education. Dzongkha is compulsory in all schools. Schools are co-educational and education is not compulsory but school education is virtually free. Now, education has spread to all parts of the country. <b>Thimphu</b> has several educational institutions from schooling level to the college level in several disciplines. There are more private schools in <b>Thimphu</b> than in any other place in Bhutan, which are all {{under the control of the}} Department of Education. The National Training Authority administers three technical institutes.|$|E
25|$|Access to {{potable water}} is {{available}} to 90% {{of the population in}} <b>Thimphu,</b> though water supply is intermittent, attributed to leakage and high consumer demand.|$|E

25|$|Under the Wangchu Dynasty, {{the country}} enjoyed peace and {{progress}} under successive reformist monarchs. The third king, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, reformed the old pseudo-feudal systems by abolishing serfdom, redistributing land, and reforming taxation. He also introduced many executive, legislative, and judiciary reforms. Reforms continued and in 1952 {{the decision was}} made to shift the capital from the ancient capital of Punakha to <b>Thimphu.</b> The fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, opened the country for development and India provided the needed impetus in this process with financial and other forms of assistance. In 1961, <b>Thimphu</b> officially became the capital of Bhutan.|$|E

25|$|The Civic Administration of <b>Thimphu</b> city is the {{responsibility}} of the <b>Thimphu</b> Municipal Corporation (TMC). It was established in 1995 through a royal decree. It became an autonomous corporation in 1999, following the enactment of the Municipal Act of 1999. Its headquarters is at the Lungtenzampa zone of <b>Thimphu.</b> The corporation is headed by a mayor (currently Dasho Nima Wangdi) who is called Thrompon in the Bhutanese language. The mayor is appointed by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS). An executive committee comprising 17 members governs the corporation; 8 members are elected from 6 zones and 7 members are nominated from government organizations and meet nearly every 6 weeks. However, its capacity to deal with the problems is hindered by lack of adequate staff (without any proportionate increase in staff strength to deal with its large jurisdiction) and its expenditure far outstrips the revenue earned. In order to provide cost effective services, the Corporation (as the regulating body) has contemplated privatization of public services, particularly water supply, solid waste, sewerage and parking.|$|E
