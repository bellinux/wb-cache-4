5|$|As a {{legal advisor}} {{working for the}} United States Department of War, he drafted {{recommendations}} and reports that were used by Congress and the executive branch in governing the United States' new territories following the Spanish–American War. These reports were collected as a published book in 1902, then considered the seminal work on the subject. During his time as a governor, Magoon worked <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> recommendations into practice.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1890s, Tesla {{would pursue}} his ideas for {{wireless}} lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements {{on the possibility}} of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.|$|E
5|$|Since no {{consensus}} could be reached, the committee decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> three definitions {{to a wider}} vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from {{two of the three}} proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf planet and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot.|$|E

25|$|Following {{reports from}} missionaries, there was growing moral outrage, {{particularly}} in Britain and the United States. The Congo Reform Association, led by Edmund Dene Morel, was {{particularly important in}} this campaign, and published numerous best-selling tracts and pamphlets (including Red Rubber) which reached a vast public. King Leopold appointed and financed his own commission <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> accusations to rest, but it too confirmed the atrocities.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> figures into a {{personal}} perspective, when Mount Stephen died in 1921, after providing for his wife, step-daughter and charities, he left £1,414,319 {{to be divided}} between nineteen relatives, which worked out at about £75,000 each. Though hardly an inconsequential sum, he gave substantially more to charity than he left to his individual heirs. In his will, he left little to charities in Canada, believing that through the donations mentioned above and his legacy that was the Canadian Pacific Railway, he had given more to Canada than it had given to him.|$|E
25|$|There, James Pinchot's primary {{endeavor}} {{was planning}} and designing Grey Towers {{and the land}} around it. At first, he developed the land along lines of the ornamental farm advocated by Andrew Jackson Downing. The original drive up the hill was meant {{to show off his}} orchards. In 1884, he retained Hunt, a family friend, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> ideas for a French-style chateau, modeled after the Marquis de Lafayette's LaGrange and reflecting the Pinchot family's origin in France, on paper for eventual construction. Two years later it was complete, but not before Pinchot altered the plans slightly to save money. While Hunt was away in Europe, he also had Edwards-Ficken alter Hunt's design slightly when bedrock on the site made it difficult to build the raised foundation Hunt had originally planned. Edwards-Ficken added some of his own decorative touches to the house, such as the front door, interior paneling and wrought iron porches on the south and east facades.|$|E

I have spent the best part of my life trying <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful.

500|$|She did {{not agree}} with {{allowing}} spiritual and magical techniques to transmit between different cultures, believing that to do so caused damage; she for instance cautioned against allowing Western esoteric teachings to be practiced in India because [...] "the Hindu dies readily from shock". Equally she strongly opposed the adoption of Asian religious techniques into Western esotericism, distancing herself from occultists who did so. In her words, she must [...] "recommend to the white races the traditional Western system, which is admirably adapted to their psychic constitution". She nevertheless perceived value in Westerners studying Asian disciplines like Yoga on a theoretical level, so long as they eschewed any attempt <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> teachings into practice.|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} CO 2 laser marking was studied {{with a view}} <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> <b>these</b> lasers <b>to</b> {{practical}} use in the semiconductor industry. The marking {{is found to be}} due to surface spattering rather than burning, which is the main factor in YAG laser marking. The visibility greatly increases by the application of a surface treatment such as marker ink, varnish or poster color. The CO 2 laser may therefore be used in place of the YAG laser, now widely used for marking, with some merits: CO 2 laser marking is cheaper and faster, and in addition there is not danger of injury from irradiating laser light...|$|R
60|$|She avoided her rosary, because, {{moving her}} with curious passion as it did, it meant only these not very {{significant}} things. She put it away. It was her instinct <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all <b>these</b> things away. It was her instinct to avoid thinking, to avoid it, to save herself.|$|R

500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
500|$|... "Three of a Kind" [...] {{functions}} as a sequel of sorts to the fifth season episode [...] "Unusual Suspects", concluding a minor story-arc featuring The Lone Gunmen and Susanne Modeski, the woman who {{led to the creation}} of the trio. At the time of filming for [...] "Three of a Kind", David Duchovny, who portrays Fox Mulder, was unavailable for filming because he was preparing his directing debut, [...] "The Unnatural". Only David Duchovny's voice appears in the episode, during a scene when The Lone Gunmen electronically synthesize it in order to convince Scully to travel to Las Vegas. In order to compensate for this loss, co-executive producers Vince Gilligan and John Shiban decided to write an episode based around The Lone Gunmen. The two wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines, mostly notably the disappearance of Susanne Modeski. Gilligan explained, [...] "I'd been thinking a lot about what happened to Susanne Modeski—what happened to her after she drove off with X in that mysterious car at the end of 'Unusual Suspects'". Gilligan and Shiban soon formulated a plot that revolved around the Lone Gunmen in Las Vegas. [...] "Las Vegas just seemed a really good place <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> guys. First of all, because the idea of them running through a casino is instantly hilarious. But the other thing [...] is that Las Vegas is in some ways the most watched city in the world". Furthermore, Michael McKean, who portrayed Morris Fletcher in the two-part episode [...] "Dreamland", makes a brief cameo as one of the men flirting with Scully.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his tenure, {{healthcare}} costs continued to moderate.

2500|$|All {{that was}} still to come for Bradman when he toured England with the Australian team in 1930. [...] Bradman scored heavily, 974 runs {{at an average of}} 139.14 [...] {{including}} a then world record 334 at Leeds, two other double centuries and another single. [...] Watching these displays of batting was Douglas Jardine, playing for Surrey. [...] Following discussions with other observers such as Percy Fender and George Duckworth, he developed a tactic to limit the prodigious run scoring of Bradman and the others. [...] The tactic, originally called fast leg theory and later called bodyline involved fast short pitched bowling directed at the batsman's body and a packed leg side field.

[...] In addition, children also experience cognitive symptoms like fear of dying, feelings of being detached from oneself, feelings of losing control or going crazy, but {{they are unable to}} vocalize these higher order manifestations of fear. [...] They simply know that something is going wrong and that they are very afraid. Children can only describe the physical symptoms. They have not yet developed the constructs <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>these</b> symptoms together and label them as fear. Parents often feel helpless when they watch a child suffer. [...] They can help children give a name to their experience, and empower them to overcome the fear they are experiencing ...|$|E

In this paper, we present a two-stage method {{for the assessment of}} the opportunity cost of the periodical release of flushing flows in the lower reaches of rivers with regimes that are basically controlled by series of dams equipped with hydropower generation facilities. The methodology is applied to the Lower Ebro River in Spain. The results show that the cost of the reduced power generation resulting from the implementation of flushing floods is lower than the observed willingness to pay for river restoration programmes...|$|R
