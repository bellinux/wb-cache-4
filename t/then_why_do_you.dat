60|$|DAISY. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{treat me}} as an outcast? Oh, it's cruel, cruel.|$|E
60|$|HUSH <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> cry? It's {{you and me}} {{the same}} as before.|$|E
60|$|MISS T. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> always {{stand out}} after {{half a dozen}} turns? I thought {{officers}} in the Army didn't tell fibs.|$|E
60|$|INSPECTOR. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say <b>you</b> <b>did?</b> There's been a theft here, and {{anything}} you say {{may be used}} against you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{come and}} disturb me?" [...] she said, almost angrily, if not quite, an {{enlarging}} red spot rising in each cheek.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{begin with}} your detestable red-nosed giantesses? And she would, she would, she would, she would, she WOULD powder it!’ cries Rosa, {{in a little}} burst of comical {{contradictory}} spleen.|$|R
6000|$|BARBARA. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> keep {{thinking}} about it? Why does it keep coming up against {{you in your}} mind? You're not getting converted, are you? ...|$|E
6000|$|Tall black Bacchae of midnight, why <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> rush to assail me? Do I {{intrude on}} your rites nocturnal? What should it avail me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand. We {{are quite}} willing, since it lies upon our road. But <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come against us, who are {{peaceful}} travellers, with your spears lifted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am nearly six. Did <b>you</b> love {{grandmother}}? <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{never come}} to see her? Did grandmother know you was here? Why not? Why didn't I not know about you till after grandmother died?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God help me," [...] {{said the}} poor man, {{searching for his}} handkerchief, and utterly confounded, [...] "why is it you have come to me, <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> wake me up?" [...] he added, so far forgetting himself.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was much}} {{surprised}} by this explanation, {{and a good deal}} relieved to find that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; but instead of replying, I said, [...] "If it be as <b>you</b> state, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> take me from my island, and <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not now take me back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still I do not understand," [...] said Margaret more softly. [...] "You {{say that}} your life or welfare hung on this shameful business. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> reveal it to me now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{all three}} prefer Douglas? And you, boys, who are such Tories, {{will you go}} see a play which is wrote by a Whig Scotchman, who was {{actually}} made prisoner at Falkirk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you take}} it <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> do it? Your life is not like his. Oh, Scatcherd! Scatcherd!" [...] and the doctor {{prepared}} to pour out the flood of his eloquence in beseeching this singular man to abstain from his well-known poison.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon. I {{should not have}} said so. It was very wrong; but, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ask so foolish a question? Did I not tell you to let there be an end of it? And now will you {{let me give you}} one little bit of advice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] {{she said}} at length, [...] "were you in the square garden {{on the night of}} that dance at which I came out? Oh! I see by your look that <b>you</b> were. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not speak to me instead of {{standing}} behind a bush, watching in that mean fashion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have children? <b>Why</b> weren't you celibate? They have to {{live among}} men. If they have no place among men, why have you put them there? If the peace of God {{is no more than}} the peace of death, why are your sons born of you? How can you have peace with God, if you leave no peace for your sons--no peace, no pride, no place on earth? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know how}} willing I am to help you, Cytherea,' she added reproachfully. 'You know it. Why {{are you so}} obstinate <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> selfishly bar the clear, honourable, and only sisterly path which leads out of this difficulty? I cannot, on my conscience, countenance you; no, I cannot.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{and twice}} {{in the months that}} {{followed}} you passed me on the street and did not know me, Martin almost said aloud. Each time I was hungry and heading for the pawnbroker. Yet it was work performed. You did not know me <b>then.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know me now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What in {{the name}} of Pluto is the matter with you all?" [...] cried the amazed senator, whose night of potations had left him in no mood for patience. [...] "Why do you stand moping there? Stephanos, Vacculus, is {{anything}} amiss? Here, Promus, you are the head of my household. What is it, <b>then?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> turn your eyes away from me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|If Mrs. Brook {{was less}} {{diverted}} she followed perhaps more closely. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{me so much}} justice <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> put to me such a cold cruel question?--I mean when you so oddly challenged me on my handing on your news to Mitchy. If the principal beauty of our effort to live together is--and quite according to your own eloquence--in our sincerity, I simply obeyed the impulse to do the sincere thing. If we're not sincere we're nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{would have}} murdered you, Master, {{and you made}} him fast! <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not stop to keep him till I came along, {{and we would have}} haled him to the stocks? That would have been sport and all. You call me fool--but if you found a man covered with blood and hurts tied to a tree, and he daft and not able to speak, had you not cut him loose? Well, he's gone, and this alone is left of him,' and he spun the piece into the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "You like it, <b>then?</b> But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{think it}} is yours, my lass?" [...] asked Dr. Alec, as he sat down looking well pleased, and drew his excited little niece to his knee.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] {{cried the}} girl. [...] "Your own schemes have all failed, you say; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{not think of}} {{becoming}} a priest in reality, and getting the good there must be in such a calling? It is singular that I should venture to {{say such a thing}} to you, and it must seem presumptuous and ridiculous for me, a Protestant--but our ways are so different."... She paused, coloring deeply, then controlled herself, and added with grave composure, [...] "If you were to pray"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] said Mrs. Peyton pettishly, [...] "nor do I want to! You know, John, how distasteful and {{unpleasant}} {{it is for}} me to have those dreary, petty, and vulgar details of the poor child's past life recalled, and, thank Heaven, I have forgotten them except when you choose to drag them before me. You agreed, long ago, that we were never to talk of the Indian massacre of her parents, so that we could also ignore it before her; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> talk of her vulgar friends, who are just as unpleasant? Please let us drop the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But was I more {{happy when}} I was drudging? I was not. I was just bedraggled and unhappy. It's work--but not my work. I could run an office or a library, or nurse and teach children. But solitary dish-washing isn't {{enough to satisfy}} me--or many other women. We're going to chuck it. We're going to wash 'em by machinery, and come out and play with you men in the offices and clubs and {{politics}} you've cleverly kept for yourselves! Oh, we're hopeless, we dissatisfied women! <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to have us about the place, to fret you? So it's for your sake that I'm going!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has said}} nothing about that. He will {{probably}} be at the House of Commons, or too busy somewhere {{to come to me}} <b>then.</b> But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> ask? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> wish to hurry through town?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why has {{he called}} himself an {{attorney}}, <b>then,</b> and <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> call him one? An attorney is an attorney, in my eyes, and little difference is there atween 'em. Rattlesnakes would fare better in a clearin' of Thousandacres' than the smartest attorney in the land!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sushil Narsian (born November 1, 1978) is a Mumbai-based design {{consultant}} {{who became a}} minor celebrity all over India on April 1, 2017 {{when he became a}} social media celebrity for being erroneously charged INR 149 crore ($22 million) by Indian taxi-hailing company Ola Cabs. Sushil is a universal brother and friend, but Aditya Joshi is his close brother[...] His friends say that he loves to give additional information about things. He is quite a trivia master and makes the best Sangria in the world. Sushil will praise restaurant X for 2 months, take you there and while you are there, he will spend time praising restaurant Y. [...] "Fir X mein kyun laaya, Y mein kyun nahi leke gaya" [...] (<b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get me to X, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not take me to Y), you will wonder.|$|R
6000|$|MADGE. [Moving for {{the first}} time.] There, Annie, you see that! I told George Rous, [...] "Don't think to have my company till you've made an end of all this trouble. You ought to be ashamed," [...] I said, [...] "with your own mother looking like a ghost, and not a stick {{to put on the}} fire. So long as you're able to fill your pipes, you'll let us starve." [...] "I 'll take my oath, Madge," [...] he said, [...] "I 've not had smoke nor drink these three weeks!" [...] "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> go on with it?" [...] "I can't go back on Roberts!" [...] . That's it! Roberts, always Roberts! They'd all drop it but for him. When he talks it's the devil that comes into them.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not give}} you all this account, my good Sir, to flatter you. I mean it to reproach you. Such {{relations}} the first peer in the realm might own with pride; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not keep up more correspondence with these so amiable young folks? I had a thousand questions to answer about you. I had to describe the little ones with the minuteness of anatomy. They were highly delighted when I told them that John[48] was so good a boy, and so fine a scholar, and that Willie was going on still very pretty; but I have it in commission to tell her from them, that beauty is a poor silly bauble without she be good. Miss Chalmers I had left in Edinburgh, but I {{had the pleasure of}} meeting with Mrs. Chalmers, only Lady Mackenzie being rather a little alarmingly ill of a sore throat somewhat marred our enjoyment.|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} {{in a bitter}} voice, [...] "are you like all the others? Do you scorn me also because I am of a race more ancient and honourable than those of any of your {{mushroom}} lords and kings? You know my life: say, what have I done wrong? Have I caught Christian children and crucified them to death? Have I defrauded my neighbour or oppressed the poor? Have I mocked your symbol of the Host? Have I conspired against the rulers of this land? Have I been a false friend or a cruel father? You shake your heads; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> stare at me as though I were a thing accursed and unclean? Have I not a right to the faith of my fathers? May I not worship God in my own fashion?" [...] And he looked at Peter, a challenge in his eyes. [...] "Sir," [...] answered Peter, [...] "without a doubt you may, or {{so it seems to}} me. But then, why for all these years have you appeared to worship Him in ours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wretch!" [...] exclaimed the clergyman: [...] "and had <b>you</b> not, <b>then,</b> <b>done</b> enough? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{expose the}} paramour of one brother {{to become the}} wife of another?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Boldwood, {{in a more}} elastic voice. [...] "Oh, Troy, if {{you like}} her best, <b>why</b> <b>then</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> step in here and injure my happiness?" ...|$|R
500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|R
