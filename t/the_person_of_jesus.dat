25|$|Following the Apostolic Age, {{from the}} 2nd century forward, several controversies {{developed}} {{about how the}} human and divine are related within <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Eventually in 451, {{the concept of a}} Hypostatic union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human. However, differences among Christian denominations continued thereafter. See the article on Christology for details.|$|E
25|$|God in Christianity is {{the eternal}} being who created and {{preserves}} all things. Christians believe God {{to be both}} transcendent (wholly independent of, and removed from, the material universe) and immanent (involved in the world). Christian teachings of the immanence and involvement of God and his love for humanity exclude the belief that God is of the same substance as the created universe but accept that God's divine Nature was hypostatically united to human nature in <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ, in an event known as the Incarnation.|$|E
25|$|Barth's {{doctrine}} of election involves a firm rejection {{of the notion of}} an eternal, hidden decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract absolute decree is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in Jesus Christ. God's absolute decree, if one may speak of such a thing, is God's gracious decision to be for humanity in <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human sin. While some regard this revision of the {{doctrine of}} election as an improvement on the Augustinian-Calvinist doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely Brunner, have charged that Barth's view amounts to a soft universalism, thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.|$|E
5000|$|This {{position}} is {{in opposition to}} the Monothelitism position in the Christological debates. The debate concerning the Monothelite churches and the Catholic Church came to a conclusion at the Third Council of Constantinople in 681 CE. The Council declared that in line with the declarations of the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, which declared two natures in <b>the</b> one <b>Person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ, there are equally two [...] "wills" [...] or [...] "modes of operation" [...] in <b>the</b> one <b>Person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ as well.|$|R
50|$|The Incarnation implies three facts: (1) <b>The</b> Divine <b>Person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ; (2) <b>The</b> Human Nature <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ; (3) The Hypostatic Union of the Human {{with the}} Divine Nature in <b>the</b> Divine <b>Person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ. Without {{diminishing}} his divinity, he {{added to it}} all that is involved in being human. In Christian belief it is understood that Jesus was {{at the same time}} both fully God and fully human, two natures in one <b>person.</b> <b>The</b> body <b>of</b> Christ was therefore subject to all the bodily weaknesses to which human nature is universally subject; such are hunger (Matt.4:2), thirst (John 19:28), fatigue (John 4:6), pain, and death. They were the natural results of the human nature He assumed.|$|R

25|$|Leo's {{writings}} (both the sermons and the letters) {{are mostly}} concerned with theological questions concerning <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ (Christology) {{and his role}} as mediator and savior (Soteriology), which is partially connected to the Council of Chalcedon in which Roman legates participated in Leo's name. Subsequently, through numerous letters addressed to bishops {{and members of the}} imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also {{in the eastern part of}} the Roman empire. Leo defends the true divinity and the true humanity of the one Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.|$|E
500|$|While Maximus was in Carthage, a {{controversy}} broke out regarding how {{to understand the}} interaction between the human and divine natures within <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and were intensified following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The Monothelite position was developed as a compromise between the dyophysitists and the miaphysists, who believed dyophysitism is conceptually indistinguishable from Nestorianism. The Monothelites adhered to the Chalcedonian definition of the hypostatic union: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they {{went on to say that}} Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for [...] "one will"), which led some to charge them with Apollinarian monophysitism.|$|E
500|$|In Christian theology, the Messiah is the saviour of the Jewish {{people and}} humankind. The Messiah who is called Christ, is {{identified}} with <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> known by his followers as the Christ or [...] "Jesus Christ". Handel's Messiah {{has been described}} by the early-music scholar Richard Luckett as [...] "a commentary on [...] Nativity, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension", beginning with God's promises as spoken by the prophets and ending with Christ's glorification in heaven. In contrast with most of Handel's oratorios, the singers in Messiah do not assume dramatic roles; there is no single, dominant narrative voice; and very little use is made of quoted speech. In his libretto, Jennens's intention was not to dramatise the life and teachings of Jesus, but to acclaim the [...] "Mystery of Godliness", using a compilation of extracts from the Authorized (King James) Version of the Bible, and from the Psalms included in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.|$|E

2500|$|In time, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's {{claim of}} being the Mujaddid (reformer) of his era became more explicit. In {{one of his most}} {{well-known}} and praised works, Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya, a voluminous work, he claimed to be the Messiah of Islam. Muslims have maintained that Jesus will return in the flesh during the last age. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, by contrast, asserted that Jesus had in fact survived crucifixion and died of old age much later in Kashmir, where he had migrated. According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the promised Mahdi was a symbolic reference to a spiritual leader and not a military leader in <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ as is believed by many Muslims. With this proclamation, he also rejected the idea of armed Jihad and argued that the conditions for such Jihad are not present in this age, which requires defending Islam by the pen and tongue but not with the sword. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote two books named [...] "Tuhfa e qaisariah" [...] and [...] "Sitara e Qaisaria" [...] in which he invited Queen Victoria to embrace Islam and forsake Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|This dogma is {{inherently}} {{related to the}} Christological dogma of the hypostatic union which relates the divine and human natures <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ.

50|$|Many theologians {{argue for}} a Christology that is {{expressly}} based on the Trinity {{and an understanding of}} the interpersonal relationships between Father and Son and between Son and Holy Spirit.

2500|$|As a {{graduate}} of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures. Hegel's thoughts on <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion, Part 3 Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof. He espouses that, [...] "God is not an abstraction but a concrete God... God, considered {{in terms of his}} eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit." [...] This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and Human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but [...] "...rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed." ...|$|E
2500|$|I would {{propose that}} {{the subject of the}} {{ministry}} of this house, as long as this platform shall stand, and as long as this house shall be frequented by worshippers, shall be <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ. I am never ashamed to avow myself a Calvinist, although I claim to be rather a Calvinist according to Calvin, than after the modern debased fashion. [...] I do not hesitate to take the name of Baptist. You have there (pointing to the baptistry) substantial evidence that I am not ashamed of that ordinance of our Lord Jesus Christ; but if I am asked to say what is my creed, I think I must reply: [...] "It is Jesus Christ." [...] My venerable predecessor, Dr. Gill, has left a body of divinity admirable and excellent in its way; but the body of divinity to which I would pin and bind myself for ever, God helping me, is not his system of divinity or any other human treatise, but Christ Jesus, who is the sum and substance of the gospel; who is in himself all theology, the incarnation of every precious truth, the all-glorious personal embodiment of the way, the truth, and the life.|$|E
2500|$|The prologue of the Gospel of John {{describes}} the incarnated Logos, {{the light that}} came to earth, in <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> The Apocryphon of John contains a scheme of three descendants from the heavenly realm, the third one being Jesus, {{just as in the}} Gospel of John. The similarities probably point to a relationship between gnostic ideas and the Johannine community. According to Raymond Brown, the Gospel of John shows [...] "the development of certain gnostic ideas, especially Christ as heavenly revealer, the emphasis on light versus darkness, and anti-Jewish animus." [...] The Johannine material reveals debates about the redeemer myth. The Johannine letters show that there were different interpretations of the gospel story, and the Johannine images may have contributed to Second Century Gnostic ideas about Jesus as a redeemer who descended from heaven. According to DeConinck, the Gospel of John shows a [...] "transitional system from early Christianity to gnostic beliefs in a God who transcends our world." [...] According to DeConinck, the John shows a beginning bifurcation between Jesus' [...] "Father in Heaven," [...] and the Jews [...] "Father of the Devil," [...] which may have developed into the gnostic idea of the Monad and the Demiurge.|$|E

50|$|As theologians {{continued}} {{to search for}} a compromise between the Chalcedonian definition and the Monophysites, other Christologies developed that partially rejected the full humanity of Christ.

2500|$|Devotions are prayers or pious {{exercises}} used {{to demonstrate}} reverence {{for a particular}} aspect of God or <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> or for a particular saint. Catholic devotions have various forms, ranging from formalized prayers such as novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such as Eucharistic adoration, the veneration of the saints, and even horticultural practices such as maintaining a Mary garden. Common examples of Catholic devotions include the Rosary, the Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and the veneration of various saints, etc. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a Directory of devotions and pious practices. The Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of joy, of sorrow and the glory of Jesus and Mary.Sister Lucia dos Santos said:"The Most Holy Virgin in these last times {{in which we live}} has given a new efficacy to the recitation of the Rosary {{to such an extent that}} there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or above all spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families...that cannot be solved by the Rosary.

2500|$|Teachings about Jesus and testimonies {{about what}} he {{accomplished}} during his three-year public ministry are found throughout the New Testament. [...] Core biblical teachings about <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ may be summarized that Jesus Christ was and forever is fully God (divine) and fully human in one sinless person at the same time, and that through the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation {{and the promise of}} eternal life via his New Covenant. [...] While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus, Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate and [...] "true God and true man" [...] (or both fully divine and fully human). [...] Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. [...] As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. [...] Scripture asserts that Jesus was conceived, by the Holy Spirit, and born of his virgin mother Mary without a human father. [...] The Biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include miracles, preaching, teaching, healing, Death, and resurrection. [...] The apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the 1st century, said, [...] "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." [...] Most Christians now wait for the Second Coming of Christ when they believe he will fulfill the remaining Messianic prophecies.|$|E
2500|$|In The Antichrist, [...] Nietzsche fights {{against the}} way in which Christianity has become an {{ideology}} set forth by institutions like churches, and how churches have failed to represent the life of Jesus. Nietzsche finds it important to distinguish between the religion of Christianity and <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Nietzsche attacked the Christian religion, as represented by churches and institutions, for what he called its [...] "transvaluation" [...] of healthy instinctive values. Transvaluation consists of the process by which one can view the meaning of a concept or ideology from a [...] "higher" [...] context. Nietzsche went beyond agnostic and atheistic thinkers of the Enlightenment, who simply regarded Christianity as untrue. He claimed that the Apostle Paul may have deliberately propagated Christianity as a subversive religion (a [...] "psychological warfare weapon") within the Roman Empire as a form of covert revenge for the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and of the Second Temple in 70 AD during the Jewish War of 66-73 AD. Nietzsche contrasts the Christians with Jesus, whom he regarded as a unique individual, and argues he established his own moral evaluations. As such, Jesus represents a kind of step towards his ideation of the Übermensch. Ultimately, however, Nietzsche claims that, unlike the Übermensch, who embraces life, Jesus denied reality in favor of his [...] "kingdom of God". Jesus's refusal to defend himself, and subsequent death, logically followed from this total disengagement. Nietzsche goes further to analyze the history of Christianity, finding it has progressively distorted the teachings of Jesus more and more. He criticizes the early Christians for turning Jesus into a martyr and Jesus's life into the story of the redemption of mankind in order to dominate the masses, and finds the Apostles cowardly, vulgar, and resentful. He argues that successive generations further misunderstood the life of Jesus as the influence of Christianity grew. [...] Nietzsche also criticized Christianity for demonizing flourishing in life, and glorifying living an apathetic life. [...] By the 19th century, Nietzsche concludes, Christianity had become so worldly as to parody itself—a total inversion of a world view which was, in the beginning, nihilistic, thus implying the [...] "death of God".|$|E
