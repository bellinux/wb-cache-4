5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{railways}} in Weymouth was that until 1987 main-line trains ran though <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway to the Quay station at {{the eastern end of}} the harbour, to connect with ferries to mainland Europe. Due to declining business, goods traffic ceased in 1972, but passenger services continued until they ceased in 1987 from lack of use.|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing on <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|Designed as the {{commercial}} heart of San Marco, the square had declined seriously by the 1970s, with many businesses closing. The original, compass-themed fountain was demolished. In the 1990s the City of Jacksonville undertook a major renovation and streetscaping project, which included restoring the fountain with three lion statues {{inspired by the}} Piazza San Marco. Since then, the square has become a popular commercial destination with many shops, restaurants and bars. In 2013 the square underwent another renovation project that rerouted <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> expanded the small park in the center, named Balis Park, into a larger pedestrian green space.|$|E

50|$|As of {{the early}} 2000s, the Eaton Centre's owners have {{redesigned}} <b>the</b> mall's Yonge <b>Street</b> façade, bringing it closer to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> making it more closely resemble an urban shopping district, with stores opening directly onto <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> presenting a variety of façades to create the perception of an urban streetscape.|$|R
5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually {{forcing the}} ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused their forces to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., {{the sounds of}} battle died down. By midnight, the ICU front in Jilib had collapsed, and the ICU began to flee. By 2:00a.m., they had fled from Kismayo. Local militiamen patrolled <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>and</b> looting began of former ICU property. They were reported to be fleeing towards Ras Kamboni island in southern Somalia, or the Kenyan border.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>and</b> total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E
5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes the danger of <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into {{the danger of the}} streets.|$|E
40|$|Street {{children}}, {{or children}} who live and/or spend time on <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> are a vulnerable group of considerable {{concern to the}} global public health community. This paper describes the results of two linked qualitative studies conducted with children living or spending time on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> in orphanages in and around urban areas in the Republic of Georgia between 2005 and 2006. The studies examined perceived causes of children going to <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> as well as indicators of healthy functioning and psychosocial problems among these children. Results on causes indicated a range of “push” factors leading children to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> “pull” factors that keep children living on <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Findings also showed a range of internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms among children on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> within orphanages. Some differences in responses were found between children living on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> in institutions. It {{is important to understand}} the perspectives of these vulnerable populations to guide decisions on appropriate interventions that address their primary problems...|$|R

5|$|He was {{appointed}} to several offices within the Buenos Aires Cabildo in the 1781-1794 period. On April 7, 1789, he helped a number of shoemakers to establish a guild. Although there were several in Spain, no guild constitution from Spain {{was used as a}} model. He promoted the pavement of <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>and</b> the improvement of the buildings. Supported by the viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo, he collected $8,000 and provided 500 cattle to mine rocks from the Martín García Island for this work. He married his cousin Justa Rufina de Basavilbaso y Garfias on February 6, 1795.|$|E
5|$|Mackay died at {{his home}} in East Lindfield, New South Wales, on 30 September 1966 and was cremated after a service at St Stephen's, Sydney. He was survived by his wife, his son and his two daughters. Veterans lined <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> he had ten generals for his pallbearers: Herring, Woodward, Stevens, Pulver, Stevenson, Macarthur-Onslow, Dougherty, Harrison, Cullen and Galleghan. Mackay's papers and portraits are held in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2006, Monsoor's platoon engaged four {{insurgents in}} a firefight, killing one and {{injuring}} another. Anticipating further attacks, Monsoor, three SEAL snipers and three Iraqi Army soldiers {{took up a}} rooftop position. Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>and</b> a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people {{to fight against the}} Americans and the Iraqi soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E

Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices.|$|E

After defeating the Baroness, she reveals that she has also infected herself and is about to detonate. Cate hurries to clear the civilians off <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>and</b> hides inside a building as the Baroness explodes.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Milian's {{previous}} albums had pop and R stylings, she {{was encouraged}} by Island Def Jam to target a new audience and release an urban record. Explaining the change, Milian {{said that one of}} her main problems was that previous releases would often find mainstream success, but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio. As an R artist, she wanted to build her core audience–a true fan base that would support her through time–to increase her career's longevity. The main purpose of her genre change was to go back to <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> add to her core audience.|$|E

5|$|Bath Abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and became a {{religious}} centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties {{of water from the}} springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many of <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II.|$|E
