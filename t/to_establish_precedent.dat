40|$|In {{light of}} the 50 th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this group of first-year Honors {{scholars}} from Governors State University undertook close-reading and analysis {{of one of the}} most famous documents to emerge from the Civil Rights era, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail. ” This panel presents the results of that analysis across a range of sub-topics, including the biblical imagery King uses <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>precedent</b> and lend ethos appeal to his argument; the manner in which King uses “kairos,” or the opportune moment, to make his argument for the urgency of justice; the organizational strategies of the Civil Rights movement and the need for similar organization in the continued struggle for racial equality today; how King’s style and diction create a legendary illustration of the “pathos” appeal; and finally, how across the entirety of the text, through imagery and exhortation, King evokes the full catalog of primary human emotions. Using the lens of rhetoric, this panel illuminates the historical witness we encounter and the contemporary urgency we feel when we read “Letter from Birmingham Jail” today...|$|E

2500|$|The new decision, {{handed down}} {{a month after}} Quon, {{followed}} it in declining <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a <b>precedent.</b> [...] "The Supreme Court's more-recent precedent shows a marked lack of clarity in what privacy expectations as to content of electronic communications are reasonable...Given the lack of precedent, we now question {{whether it would be}} prudent in this case and on this limited factual record <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> broad <b>precedent</b> as <b>to</b> the reasonable privacy expectation in email content". The panel thus limited its decision to finding for the appellees on qualified immunity grounds.|$|R
40|$|The rule of {{stare decisis}} creates a {{presumption}} that a court’s ruling on a legal question remains binding in later decisions {{by the same}} court or hierarchically inferior courts. This presumption promotes stability in the law and protects reliance interests. Decisions that narrowly construe or overrule prior opinions can therefore seem like unprincipled threats {{to the rule of}} law. This article seeks to highlight some countervailing themes in the case law, showing that stability and the protection of reliance interests are not the exclusive concerns underlying the law of precedent. The relevant doctrine attempts to balance these objectives with competing goals, such as restraining judicial overreaching and ensuring that precedent-setting courts observe time-honored decision making practices. As developed by the Supreme Court, the law of precedent allows later judges to narrowly construe or accord diminished weight to a prior opinion if it resolves issues not before the precedent-setting court, addresses legal questions without adequate briefing or argument, or fails to justify the court’s legal conclusions. Since judicial authority consists of the power to 2 ̆ 2 say what the law is 2 ̆ 2 (Marbury v. Madison), these cross-currents in the law of precedent serve separation of powers functions. The ability of a court <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>precedent</b> acts as a check on the power of judges who come later in time. On the other hand, the ability of later judges to ignore dicta and to limit the precedential effect of opinions decided without adequate care provides a counterbalancing check on the power of the earlier court. The law of precedent thus distributes the law speaking power over time, reserving the greatest precedential impact for opinions that address only the issues before the court, based on plenary briefing and argument, and with adequate explanation of the rationale. After tracing these themes in the law of precedent, the article considers their application to three issues likely to come before the Supreme Court in future cases. Specifically, the analysis addresses how these limitations on the rule of stare decisis might affect the precedential value of Baker v. Nelson, dealing with the constitutional status of same-sex marriage; Iqbal v. Ashcroft, discussing the liability of supervisory personnel based on constitutional violations committed by their subordinates; and the viability rule of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, forbidding state regulation of abortion prior to feta...|$|E

50|$|The above {{sense of}} de facto {{is related to}} the {{relationship}} between common law traditions and formal (statutory, regulatory, civil) law, and common-law marriages. Common law norms for settling disputes in practical situations, often worked out over many generations <b>to</b> <b>establishing</b> <b>precedent,</b> are a core element informing decision making in legal systems around the world. Because its early forms originated in England in the Middle Ages, this is particularly true in Anglo-American legal traditions and in former colonies of the British Empire, while also playing a role in some countries that have mixed systems with significant admixtures of civil law.|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{discussion}} of the definition of taxation has focused narrowly on Latham's statement in Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board. in this paper we analyse the cases prior to Matthews and the formation of the so-called Latham definition of taxation. This paper questions whether these precedents produced the definition of taxation and sheds light on the perceived "watering down" of Latham's "definition" in subsequent cases. we conclude that Latham's statement of taxation was never intended to be an exhaustive list of the essential features of taxation. Accordingly, the subsequent case law, which has been described as eroding Latham's definition, is simply treating some of Latham's features as non-essential according <b>to</b> <b>established</b> <b>precedent.</b> Max Bessell, Karen Burford, Scott Henderso...|$|R

40|$|This {{comparative}} study into {{the integration of}} technology into teaching and learning, examines cases of computer use and e-learning in Science classrooms in two Southern African states, namely, South Africa (SA) and the Kingdom of Lesotho.

The Lesotho teachers are enthusiastic and keen to persevere, but consistent integration of technology as a teaching and learning tool has yet to emerge. The study identified the following main issues that hinder ICT integration: Teachers require appropriate training and workshops; more time should be set aside for technological orientation, lesson planning, and for students to use computers; hardware and software infrastructures require systematic maintenance and upgrades.

40|$|Supporting human {{decision}} making in tasks such as disaster planning and time-sensitive targeting is challenging because of the {{breadth and depth of}} knowledge that goes into the {{decision making}} process and the need to reason with this knowledge within tight time constraints. Ontologies are well suited for representing the concepts that humans use in describing the domain of interest. However, ontologies can be costly to develop and,by themselves, are inadequate to capture the kinds of decision making knowledge that arise in practice—for instance, those that refer to multiple ontologies or <b>to</b> <b>established</b> <b>precedent.</b> Such decision making knowledge can be represented by using a knowledge representation formalism that we call decision rules. These decision rules are similar to the rules used in rule based systems but can (a) include primitives from multiple ontologies and primitives that are defined by algorithms that run outside of the rule framework (b) be time dependent and (c) incorporate default assumptions. We report on our ongoing experience in using such a combination of ontologies and decision rules in building a decision support application for time sensitive targeting...|$|R

50|$|Law {{professors in}} common law traditions play {{a much smaller}} role in {{developing}} case law than professors in civil law traditions. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable <b>to</b> <b>establishing</b> <b>precedent,</b> much of the exposition {{of the law in}} civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called doctrine and may be published in treatises or in journals such as Recueil Dalloz in France. Historically, common law courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as Coke and Blackstone). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as persuasive authority; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent. Thus common law systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in civil law jurisdictions.|$|R

50|$|This text {{appears to}} answer the {{hypothetical}} {{question of whether the}} office or merely the powers of the Presidency devolved upon the Vice President on his succession.
