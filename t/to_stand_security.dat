25|$|On 24 August, Bland {{received}} a deputation from the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce, comprising Leong Lok Hing, J.P. (Chairman), Lim Hua Cheam, J.P. Lim Eu Toh, Goh Taik Chee, and Yeoh Guan Seok, {{who wished to}} address the Resident Councillor on the regulations for the quarantine of passengers. Also in attendance at that meeting were, Dr. Sidney Herbert Reginald Lucy, Acting Senior Medical Officer, Penang, Dr. George Williamson Park, Municipal Health Officer, and Mr. David Beatty, Acting Assistant Protector of Chinese, were in attendance. The Chamber desired the Government to allow any member from an imported port to land provided he produces a certificate of membership, with his photograph affixed; and that that its members may be allowed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>security</b> for the daily appearance of any passenger before the Municipal Health Officer. In both cases the member guaranteeing his own or any one else's appearance will pay a penalty of $100 in default. The deputation had been appointed {{to explain to the}} Resident Councillor the Chamber's request that its certificate of membership should be recognised as a sufficient guarantee to permit of the landing of a passenger from an infected port. Bland requested the deputation to supply further particulars concerning the constitution of the Chamber before giving his reply. They were not heard from again.|$|E

50|$|As tense as the {{situation}} in Lebanon was, ship and marines quickly settled into a routine. Too quickly perhaps, for on 23 October 1983, a terrorist shattered that routine when he drove an explosives-laden truck into {{the lobby of the}} headquarters of the Marine Corps units stationed ashore. The detonation of the mobile bomb destroyed the headquarters, killed 241 men and injured over 100 others. Austin responded to the emergency quickly by providing men <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>security</b> watches and help in the search for survivors. In November, the amphibious transport dock departed the eastern Mediterranean and began the voyage home. On 7 December, she disembarked the remnants of BLT 1/8 and MAU 24 at Morehead City. The following day Austin put into port at Little Creek, Virginia, and began postdeployment leave and upkeep.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{match against}} Braintree Town in February 2016, Bower was {{involved}} in a controversial incident described as [...] "disgraceful unsporting behaviour." [...] Recognising that a Guiseley player needed treatment, a Braintree player kicked the ball into touch. Fair play protocol dictates that the ball be passed to the Baintree goalkeeper, Tom King, on resumption of play, but Oliver Norburn instead lobbed the ball past King to score an equalising goal. A fracas resulted but the goal was allowed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> after <b>security</b> staff separated the players and management, and Bower refused to allow Braintree to walk through and score. Bower went on to defend his decision, stating that King [...] "stood there with his arms in the air and allowed the ball to into the net. It put us in a really difficult position whether we should allow them to score or not but we decided no. I think their keeper was trying to be clever and had simply let the ball go in." [...] King responded that he was [...] "bewildered" [...] by Bower's statement, and speaking on the incident itself said that: [...] "It {{is one of those things}} that will be remembered for a long time, I'll be remembered for a long time and it will carry on forever". The following week, Guiseley chairman Phil Rogerson released a statement recognising the fair-play convention had not been followed: [...] "... myself, Mark Bower and the club find the situation most regrettable and not in line with the general ethos of Guiseley AFC. Fair play is and always has been at the heart of the club. The decision to continue playing as normal after the goal was taken on the spur of the moment and under extreme pressure, not helped at all by the heated atmosphere." [...] On 21 August 2016, Bower parted company with Guiseley, after the team lost their first five matches of 2016-17.|$|R

5000|$|King {{returned}} to the National League on 19 February 2016, joining Braintree Town on an initial 28-day emergency loan. He {{was involved in a}} controversial incident in only his second appearance for the club, during a 1-1 draw with Guiseley at Nethermoor Park. He conceded the equalising goal after Oliver Norburn broke a fair play protocol and lobbed him from 30-yards out rather than passing the ball to him, after Braintree had kicked the ball into touch to allow a Guiseley player to receive treatment; a five-minute fracas followed but the goal was allowed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> after <b>security</b> staff separated the players and management, and Guiseley manager Mark Bower refused to allow Braintree to walk through and score. Bower went on to say: [...] "Their keeper stood there with his arms in the air and allowed the ball to into the net. It put us in a really difficult position whether we should allow them to score or not but we decided no. I think their keeper was trying to be clever and had simply let the ball go in." [...] King said he was [...] "bewildered" [...] by Bower's statement, and speaking on the incident itself said that: [...] "It {{is one of those things}} that will be remembered for a long time, I'll be remembered for a long time and it will carry on forever". The incident was described as [...] "one of the biggest on-field controversies seen in non-league football", and Braintree manager Danny Cowley said that: [...] "it’s the worst thing I’ve seen on a football pitch and it was disgraceful unsporting behaviour on their part". The following week, Guiseley chairman Phil Rogerson released a statement recognising the fair-play convention had not been followed: [...] "... myself, Mark Bower and the club find the situation most regrettable and not in line with the general ethos of Guiseley AFC. Fair play is and always has been at the heart of the club. The decision to continue playing as normal after the goal was taken on the spur of the moment and under extreme pressure, not helped at all by the heated atmosphere." [...] King went on to extend his loan at Cressing Road until the end of the 2015-16 season, and Braintree qualified for the play-offs, losing out to Grimsby Town at the semi-final stage following a 2-1 aggregate defeat.|$|R
