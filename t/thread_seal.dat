5000|$|The term [...] "plumber's tape" [...] {{has been}} applied to <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape in recent years. In the {{plumbing}} trade, plumber's tape is the name given to a strap of material with holes in it used for supporting pipes and fixtures.|$|E
5000|$|In a bind, master {{plumbers}} {{have been}} known to replicate the sealing action of a ferrule by using an artfully [...] "woven" [...] piece of <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape. This is attempted as a temporary solution to prevent a leak until a proper ferrule can be procured.|$|E
50|$|Thread tape is {{appropriate}} for use on tapered <b>threads,</b> where the <b>sealing</b> force is a wedge action. Parallel <b>threads</b> may not <b>seal</b> effectively with or without tape, as {{they are intended to}} be sealed by a gasket.|$|R
50|$|Pipe dope is any <b>thread</b> lubricant, <b>thread</b> <b>sealing</b> compound, and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are}} used to make a pipe thread joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the mating components. The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape (also {{known as}} PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. <b>Thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|E
5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|E
50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a pipe wrench.|$|E

50|$|Petroleum-based {{pipe dope}} is not {{intended}} for use on threaded PVC, CPVC or ABS pipe and fittings since it will deteriorate the plastic.

50|$|From 1886 to 1905, Heinrich Witzenmann {{continued}} to develop numerous noteworthy profiles for hose production {{which are still}} of technical significance today. In 1894, he registered a patent for the double metal hose consisting of two coaxial metal hoses twisted in opposite directions. Further modifications of the original form focused {{on the use of}} different hose materials and different substances for the <b>thread</b> <b>seal,</b> including rubber, textile threads, asbestos and wire.|$|E
50|$|Thread {{sealants}} such as {{joint compound}} (pipe dope or <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on compression fitting threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape used in {{plumbing}} applications is {{most commonly}} white, {{but it is}} also available in various colors. It is often used to correspond to color coded pipelines (US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand: yellow for natural gas, green for oxygen, etc.). These color-codes for thread sealing tape were introduced by Bill Bentley of Unasco Pty Ltd in the 1970s. In the UK, tape is used from coloured reels, e.g. yellow reels for gas, green for potable water.|$|E
50|$|Permacel, a {{division}} of the Nitto Denko company, is an industrial adhesive tape manufacturing company. Headquartered in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, United States, the company produces 350 kinds of tape used in a broad range of industries, including paper masking tape, reinforced strapping tape, paper packaging tape, PTFE tape, film tape, double coated tape, transfer tape, repulpable tape, <b>thread</b> <b>seal,</b> foil tape, surface protective films and vinyl tape. Permacel manufactured and sold graphic art tapes until 2004 when that part of their business was sold to Shurtape Technologies.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is slightly conical. Examples are the NPT and BSP series. The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint is created when a tapered externally threaded end is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires {{the application of a}} separate sealant in the joint, such as <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape, or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope, however some threaded pipe joints do not require a separate sealant.|$|E
50|$|The {{buttress}} thread form, {{also known as}} the breech-lock thread form, refers to two different thread profiles.
