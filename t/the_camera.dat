30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> are identical in every respect. <b>The</b> left <b>camera</b> is operated {{as a master}} while <b>the</b> right <b>camera</b> is operated as a slave but this distinction is merely {{the result of the}} way the outputs from <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> are treated by the video concentrator.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, a multiple-camera setup can be used, with <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> showing <b>the</b> {{subject at}} {{different}} sizes.

500|$|In November 2006, the Crown Fountain {{became the}} focus of a public {{controversy}} when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower.

City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but not Plensa himself. Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> as inappropriate and a blight on the towers. [...] The city said that <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> would be replaced with permanent, less intrusive models in several months; it contended that <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> similar to those used throughout Chicago in high-crime areas and at traffic intersections, had been added largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out LED lights on the fountain. The Chicago Tribune published an article on <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and <b>the</b> public reaction; <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were removed <b>the</b> next day, with Plensa's support.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> were {{delivered}} to the ISS on the Progress M-21M (Progress 53P) cargo spacecraft, which docked with the station on 29 November 2013. On 27 December 2013, {{an attempt was made}} to install <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> on <b>the</b> Russian Zvezda module of the ISS, during a spacewalk by Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky, which also broke the record for the longest Russian spacewalk ever. A problem occurred that prevented <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> from properly transmitting telemetry data, so the installation was not completed and <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were taken back inside the space station. A second attempt to install <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> by <b>the</b> same pair of spacewalkers, was made on 27 January 2014. <b>The</b> high resolution <b>camera</b> was successfully installed. The second of <b>the</b> two <b>cameras,</b> <b>the</b> medium-resolution unit, did not send any telemetry.

5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which they turn {{to the right and}} back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
50|$|The {{direction}} of the adjustment relative to <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> meter reading depends on the dynamic range (or contrast ratio) of the scene. Typically, with low-contrast scenes, an increase in exposure over that indicated by <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> meter will be required. When attempting a single-exposure of a high dynamic-range scene, a reduction in exposure from the meter's reading may be needed. In the final analysis, however, <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> meter is irrelevant to ETTR since the ETTR exposure is established, not by a meter reading, but by <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> exposure indicators, <b>the</b> histogram and/or the highlight-clipping indicators (blinkies/zebras).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} linear method for self-calibration of a moving rig when no {{correspondence}} are available between <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> Such a scenario occurs, for example, when <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> have different viewing angles, different zoom factors or different spectral range. It {{is assumed that}} during {{the motion of the}} rig, the relative viewing angle between <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> remains fixed and is known. Except for the fixed relative viewing angle, any of the internal parameters and any of the other external parameters of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> may vary freely. The calibration is done by linearly computing multilinear invariants, expressing the relations between the optical axes of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> during <b>the</b> motion. A solution is then extracted from these invariants. Given the affine calibration, the metric calibration is known to be achieved linearly (e. g. by assuming zero skew) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Twokey {{problems}} for camera networks that observe wide areas with many distributed cameras are self-localization and camera identification. Although {{there are many}} methods for localizing <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> one of <b>the</b> easiest and most desired methods is to estimate camera positions by having <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> observe each other; hence the term self-localization. If <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> have a wide viewing field, e. g. an omnidirectional camera, and can observe each other, baseline distances between pairs of cameras and relative locations can be determined. However, if the projection of a camera is relatively small on the image of other cameras and is not readily visible, the baselines cannot be detected. In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the baselines and relative locations of these “invisible ” <b>cameras.</b> <b>The</b> method consists of two processes executed simultaneously: (a) to statistically detect the baselines among <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> and (b) to localize <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> by using information from (a) and propagating triangle constraints. Process (b) works for the localization in the case where <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> are observed each other, {{and it does not}} require complete observation among <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> However, if many cameras cannot be observed each other because of the poor image resolution, it dose not work. The baseline detection by process (a) solves the problem. This methodology is described in detail and results are provided for several scenarios...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> are {{positioned}} {{next to each}} other at waist height. They point {{down the length of the}} room and the combined image shows two widely disparate views.

He walks back to <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and adjusts them, rotating one slightly inward and then the other. As he walks down the room again, the two images of him are much closer together. At a point close up to <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> <b>the</b> images converge to make a single image of his body. He again approaches <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and turns them further inward. As he walks the length of the room this time, the images of his body are much closer together. The point where they appear as one is far away, at the other side of the room, indicating that he did not only rotate <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> inwards, but also may have inadvertently moved them closer together.|$|R
