25|$|Paleotologists {{compared}} the taxonomic diversity {{and patterns of}} morphological disparity in mosasaurs with sea level, sea surface temperature, and stable carbon isotope curves for the Upper Cretaceous to explore factors that may have influenced their evolution. No single factor unambiguously accounts for all radiations, diversification, and extinctions; however, the broader patterns of taxonomic diversification and morphological disparity point <b>to</b> <b>niche</b> differentiation in a “fishing up” scenario {{under the influence of}} “bottom-up” selective pressures. The most likely driving force in mosasaur evolution was high productivity in the Late Cretaceous, driven by tectonically controlled sea levels and climatically controlled ocean stratification and nutrient delivery. When productivity collapsed {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, coincident with bolide impact, mosasaurs became extinct.|$|E

25|$|In 1952 the FIM, motorcycling's {{international}} governing body, set up {{an individual}} European Championship using a 500cc engine displacement formula. In 1957 it was upgraded to World Championship status. In 1962 a 250cc world championship was established. In the smaller 250cc category companies with two-stroke motorcycles came into their own. Companies such as Husqvarna from Sweden, CZ from the former Czechoslovakia and Greeves from England became popular due to their lightness and agility. Stars of the day included BSA-works riders Jeff Smith and Arthur Lampkin, with Dave Bickers, Joe Johnson and Norman Brown on Greeves. By the 1960s, advances in two-stroke engine technology meant that the heavier, four-stroke machines were relegated <b>to</b> <b>niche</b> competitions.

25|$|Dale Russell {{described}} the new {{genus and species}} Daspletosaurus torosus. He classified it in the family Tyrannosauridae rather than the historical home of tyrannosaurs, the Deinodontidae, setting a trend among paleontologists that would see the latter familial name fall into disuse {{in favor of the}} former. He observed that Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus lived {{at the same time and}} place, while Daspletosaurus was less common. He also noticed that hadrosaurs and ceratopsians were both present in the same deposits, with ceratopsians being less common. He speculated that this parallel may have been due <b>to</b> <b>niche</b> partitioning between the tyrannosaurs as each specialized in prey, with the lighter built and more common Gorgosaurus feeding on hadrosaurs and the more rugged and less common Daspletosaurus specializing in the rarer and more dangerous ceratopsians. He noted that while adult tyrannosaurs may have fed on such large prey, very young individuals would be limited to quarry like birds, frogs, mammals, and small reptiles.|$|E

500|$|Organisms {{are subject}} to {{environmental}} pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The regulatory feedback between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a beaver pond) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or silica skeleton deposits from marine organisms. The process and concept of ecosystem engineering is related <b>to</b> <b>niche</b> construction, but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes {{to the environment and}} the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: [...] "organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Yule {{model is}} based on a much earlier, GaltonWatson model which was used to {{describe}} the distribution of species among genera. The Yule model assumes random branching of species trees, with each species (branch tip) having the equivalent probability of giving rise to new species or becoming extinct. As the number of species within a genus, within a clade, has a similar distribution to the number of individuals within a species, within a community (i.e. the [...] "hollow curve"), Sean Nee (2003) used the model to describe relative species abundances. In many ways this model is similar <b>to</b> <b>niche</b> apportionment models, however, Nee intentionally did not propose a biological mechanism for the model behavior, arguing that any distribution can be produced by a variety of mechanisms.|$|E

2500|$|Unified {{neutral theory}} is a {{hypothesis}} proposed by Stephen Hubbell in 2001. The hypothesis aims {{to explain the}} diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities, although like other neutral theories in ecology, Hubbell's hypothesis assumes that the differences between members of an ecological community of trophically similar species are [...] "neutral," [...] or irrelevant to their success. Neutrality means that at a given trophic level in a food web, species are equivalent in birth rates, death rates, dispersal rates and speciation rates, when measured on a per-capita basis. [...] This implies that biodiversity arises at random, as each species follows a random walk. [...] This {{can be considered a}} null hypothesis <b>to</b> <b>niche</b> theory. The hypothesis has sparked controversy, and some authors consider it a more complex version of other null models that fit the data better.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marketing}} management school, {{evolved in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s, is fundamentally linked with the marketing mix framework, a business tool used in marketing and by marketers. In his paper [...] "The Concept of the Marketing Mix", Neil H. Borden reconstructed {{the history of the}} term [...] "marketing mix". [...] He started teaching the term after an associate, James Culliton, described the role of the marketing manager in 1948 as a [...] "mixer of ingredients"; one who sometimes follows recipes prepared by others, sometimes prepares his own recipe as he goes along, sometimes adapts a recipe from immediately available ingredients, and at other times invents new ingredients no one else has tried. The marketer E. Jerome McCarthy proposed a four Ps classification (Product, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1960, which has since been used by marketers throughout the world. Robert F. Lauterborn proposed a four Cs classification (Consumer, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1990 which is a more consumer-oriented version of the four Ps that attempts to better fit the movement from mass marketing <b>to</b> <b>niche</b> marketing. Koichi Shimizu proposed a 7Cs Compass Model (corporation, commodity, cost, communication, channel, consumer, circumstances) to provide a more complete picture of the nature of marketing in 1981.|$|E

The Metro noted that if one does not purchase any of the additional hardware controllers, [...] "it's not much different to Rock Band 2". Goldstein commented that the amount of investment into the game will affect one's perception of the game's value: [...] "either something completely new and challenging or just more tracks to rock out to". Goldstein further noted that with the cost and time spent on the Pro guitar models, [...] "why not spend a little more and buy the real thing". Several reviewers commented that the buttoned Mustang Pro guitar is not as sturdy as other instruments and does not have the same tactile feel as a real guitar. Specifically, the reviewers noted that the width of the button impressions do not vary in width as real guitar strings would, and there is no tactile feedback as one would have with a fretboard. These reviewers suggested that players, if dedicated to the Pro guitar mode, to wait for the stringed Fender Squier which had more favorable reviews.|$|E
