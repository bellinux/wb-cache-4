40|$|Elevated {{arterial}} pressure levels increase the hemodynamic load on heart and vessels, thus leading to functional and structural abnormalities. Because cardiac and vascular changes {{increase the risk}} of cardiovascular disease, their reversal is an important target of antihypertensive therapy, even though the prognostic value of this regression has not been fully established. In patients with untreated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, <b>trandolapril,</b> a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, reduces blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral resistance and improves both systolic and diastolic ventricular function. The latter effect is not only functional in nature because, after long-term antihypertensive treatment, the improvement in diastolic ventricular function is detectable also after 1 -month withdrawal of <b>trandolapril.</b> The concurrent reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy may contribute to the improved left ventricular diastolic function. However, plethysmographic studies suggest that long-term antihypertensive treatment with <b>trandolapril</b> is also able to reverse structural vascular changes in the forearm vascular bed, because after 1 -month washout forearm peripheral resistance also is lower than in control conditions.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compute a cost-effectiveness ratio relating the economic cost of <b>trandolapril</b> to the number of effectiveness units (i. e. life-years) gained. Design and Setting: The <b>trandolapril</b> cardiac evaluation (TRACE) study was a prospective placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to determine the long term effect of the oral angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>trandolapril</b> in postinfarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction. We used the individual data of the TRACE trial to compute a cost-effectiveness ratio relating the economic cost of <b>trandolapril</b> to the number of life-years saved. The analysis was differential and was conducted from a payer perspective in a French setting. Costs were computed from individual data related to the use of resources during the TRACE trial. For drug treatments, we chose French public prices, and for hospitalisations, we used the mean cost as determined by the diagnosis related group (DRG) from the 1996 Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information (PMSI) database from the French Ministry of Health. Life expectancy was estimated through an accelerated failure-time model with an exponential distribution specification; we made the conservative hypothesis that the effect of <b>trandolapril</b> on mortality after the end of the trial was nil. We assessed the standard deviation and the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the ratio through its bootstrap distribution. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of treating patients with <b>trandolapril</b> rather than with placebo was estimated as 4910 French francs (FF) per life-year saved. Discounting both costs and health effects led to a ratio of FF 6950 per life-year saved. The bootstrap estimate of the ratio reached FF 5950 and the 95 % CI was FF 5650 to FF 6250 per life-year saved. Conclusions: These results could be considered as highly cost effective, even though our estimation was very close to the design and the conditions of the TRACE trial.

40|$|Background. Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists such as {{verapamil}} {{are equally}} {{effective in reducing}} proteinuria as ACE inhibitors in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. To date it is unknown whether verapamil elucidates such an antiproteinuric capacity in non-diabetic renal disease. Methods. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled. random cross-over study which compared the antiproteinuric effect of 6 weeks treatment with verapamil SR (360 mg) {{to that of the}} ACE inhibitor <b>trandolapril</b> (4 mg), and their fixed combination vera/tran (180 mg verapamil SR and 2 mg <b>trandolapril)</b> in 11 non-diabetic patients with proteinuria of 6. 6 (5. 1 - 8. 8) g/day, a creatinine clearance of 87 (74 - 106) ml/min, and a 24 -h blood pressure of 136 / 85 (126 / 76 - 157 / 96) mmHg at baseline. Results. Twenty-four-hour mean arterial pressure did not change during verapamil, whereas both <b>trandolapril</b> and vera/tran induced a significant reduction in MAP. Verapamil showed no significant effects on renal haemodynamics. <b>Trandolapril</b> and vera/tran did not significantly change GFR, but ERPF increased and FF decreased during both treatments (P < 0. 05). The antiproteinuric response of verapamil was significantly less compared to that of <b>trandolapril</b> and vera/tran (- 12 % (- 17 /- 1) vs - 51 % (- 56 /- 25) and - 41 % (- 50 /- 19) respectively). The blood pressure and antiproteinuric response during verapamil tended to be greater in hypertensive patients than in normotensive patients, although this difference was not significant. Baseline blood pressure was related to the change in blood pressure during verapamil (r = - 0. 70; P < 0. 02). Conclusions. The antiproteinuric and antihypertensive response of verapamil is less than that of the ACE inhibitor <b>trandolapril</b> in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. In contrast to the antiproteinuric response of <b>trandolapril,</b> the antiproteinuric reponse of verapamil seems to be completely dependent from effective blood pressure reduction.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the effect of treatment with verapamil, <b>trandolapril</b> and their combination on peripheral microcirculation vasoreactivity. METHODS: Twenty hypertensive patients were randomized to receive oral <b>trandolapril</b> (4 mg oid; TRA) or verapamil (240 mg oid; VER) for 6 months and then the combination of the two drugs for additional 6 months. At baseline, 6 months and 12 months, peripheral microcirculation vasoreactivity was evaluated by forearm blood flow technique (venous plethysmography), as vasodilation to an endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and an endothelium-independent stimulus (sodium nitroprusside, SNP); minimal forearm vascular resistances (MFVR) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Blood pressure decreased similarly and progressively in both groups throughout the study period. In VER, 6 -month verapamil treatment significantly increased vasodilation to acetylcholine, but not to SNP. The superimposition of <b>trandolapril</b> increased the response to SNP, and less to acetylcholine. In TRA group, 6 -month treatment with <b>trandolapril</b> improved the response to SNP, but not to acetylcholine. In this group, the superimposition of verapamil caused a significant improvement in the response to acetylcholine, but not to SNP. At the end of the study, MFVR were significantly reduced in both groups, but to a greater extent in TRA. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that chronic treatment with verapamil ameliorates endothelial function in the forearm microcirculation of essential hypertensive patients, while <b>trandolapril</b> protects microcirculation from structural alterations. The combination of the two drugs is potentially a powerful tool to counteract hypertension-related microvascular dysfunction and damage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} long-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>trandolapril</b> in diabetic patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUNDPatients with diabetes mellitus have a high mortality following AMI, probably due to {{a high risk of}} congestive heart failure and reinfarction. Because ACE inhibition effectively reduces progression of heart failure, it could be particularly beneficial in diabetic patients after AMI. METHODSThe study is a retrospective analysis using data from the <b>Trandolapril</b> Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of <b>trandolapril</b> in 1, 749 patients with AMI and ejection fraction ≤ 35 %. The mean follow-up time was 26 months. RESULTSA history of diabetes was found in 237 (14 %) of the 1, 749 patients. Treatment with <b>trandolapril</b> resulted in a relative risk (RR) of death from any cause for the diabetic group of 0. 64 (95 % confidence interval 0. 45 to 0. 91) versus 0. 82 (0. 69 to 0. 97) for the nondiabetic group. In the diabetic group, <b>trandolapril</b> reduced the risk of progression to severe heart failure markedly (RR, 0. 38 [0. 21 to 0. 67]), and no significant reduction of this end point was found in the nondiabetic group.

MethodsTo address this issue, we studied {{the effect of a}} late treatment with the angiotensin-convertine enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>trandolapril</b> in the Fisher 344 to Lewis rat kidney transplant model. Seven months after transplant a renal biopsy was done for graft histology examination. Thereafter rats received either no treatment (allograft-none) or <b>trandolapril</b> until sacrifice at month 13. ResultsAll animals were alive {{at the end of the}} study with the exception of a rat in the untreated group that died of renal insufficiency at day 292.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} <b>TRAndolapril</b> Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) {{trial was}} to {{evaluate}} whether mortality of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction shortly after myocardial infarction (MI) is reduced by long term treatment with an ACE-inhibitor, regardless {{of the presence of}} heart failure or ischemia. 7001 consecutive enzyme confirmed Mis in 27 Danish hospitals were screened for entry into the study 2 – 6 days following MI. At screening 2 dimensional echocardiography was recorded on videotape at the center and evaluated centrally. Wall motion index (WMI) was evaluated, and patients with WMI :≤ 1. 2 (corresponding to left ventricular ejection fraction :≤ 0. 35) were eligible for the study. Heart failure and ischemia did not exclude patients. After receiving a test dose. patients were randomly allocated to receive oral treatment with <b>Trandolapril</b> or placebo 3 – 7 days following the MI. The primary endpoint was all cause mortality (intention to treat). Follow up was a minimum of 2 years (range 2 – 4 years). Results 2606 (37 %) of the screened MIs had WMI :≤ 1. 2. This represented a high risk group with an overall 1 -year mortality of 34 %. In contrast, patients with WMI> 1. 2 had a one year mortality of only 12 %. Of patients eligible for the study based on LV function, 1749 patients (67 %) were included. 876 patients received <b>Trandolapril</b> and 873 patients Placebo. Baseline characteristics did not differ. <b>Trandolapril</b> caused a highly significant reduction in overall mortality. Overall risk reduction was 22 %, p= 0. 0007. At study closure mortality of <b>Trandolapril</b> treated patients was 35 % and that of placebo treated patients 42 %. ConclusionLong term treatment with <b>Trandolapril</b> of patients with LV dysfunction shortly after MI, significantly reduced mortality. The study adds to the results of the SAVE trial by including a large proportion of eligible patients and not excluding patients with heart failure or ischemia...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{ambulatory}} {{blood pressure}} monitoring in clinical studies offers some advantages {{in comparison to}} the clinic blood pressure measurement. In fact, this approach does not induce any alerting reaction and provides 24 -h blood pressure values that are more reproducible and not affected by the placebo effect. This allows a better evaluation of blood pressure under antihypertensive treatment and an optimization of the number of patients to be studied in pharmacologic trials. In a recent double-blind, parallel-group study, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to investigate the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, <b>trandolapril,</b> in 62 mild and moderate hypertensive patients. After a washout period, patients received <b>trandolapril,</b> 2 mg o. d., or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a second washout period. Clinic and 24 -h blood pressures were assessed {{at the end of each}} period. In comparing the pre- and post-treatment period, <b>trandolapril</b> significantly reduced clinic and 24 -h systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The fall was evident throughout the 24 h and was statistically significant also in the last 4 h of blood pressure monitoring. The placebo group did not show any significant blood pressure change. Thus, <b>trandolapril,</b> 2 mg once daily, is effective in reducing blood pressure. Its efficacy over 24 h is better documented by 24 -h blood pressure monitoring than by isolated clinic blood pressure measurement...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of <b>trandolapril</b> and {{losartan}} on plasminogen activator inhib-itor type 1 (PAI- 1) levels and insulin sensitivity in hyper-tensive postmenopausal women. We studied 89 hyperten-sive (diastolic blood pressure. 90 and, 110 mm Hg) postmenopausal women, aged 51 to 60 years not taking any hormone replacement therapy. Diabetic, obese, and smoking patients were excluded. After a 4 -week placebo period, they were randomized to receive 2 mg of oral <b>trandolapril</b> (n 5 45) or 50 mg of oral losartan (n 5 44) for 12 weeks according to a double-blind, parallel group de-sign. At the end of the placebo and active treatment periods, blood pressure (BP) was measured, plasma sam-ples were drawn to evaluate PAI- 1 antigen levels, and insulin sensitivity was assessed. Both <b>trandolapril</b> and losartan reduced systolic BP (by a mean of 16. 9 mm Hg and 15. 2 mm Hg, respectively, P,. 01 v placebo) and diastolic BP (by a mean of 13. 1 mm Hg and 11. 9 mm Hg, respectively, P,. 01 v placebo) with no difference be-tween the two treatments. The PAI- 1 antigen levels were significantly decreased by <b>trandolapril</b> (from 36. 9 6 21 ng/dL to 27. 2 6 17 ng/dL, P,. 05), but not by losartan (from 35. 3 6 22 ng/dL to 37. 1 6 23 ng/dL, P 5 not significant). Glucose infusion rate was significantly in-creased by <b>trandolapril</b> (from 6. 67 6 0. 56 mg/min/kg to 7. 9 6 0. 65 mg/min/kg, P,. 05), but was not significantly modified by losartan (from 6. 7 6 0. 47 mg/min/kg to 6. 9 6 0. 50 mg/min/kg, P 5 not significant). In the <b>trandolapril</b> group the PAI- 1 decrease correlated with glucose infusion rate increase (r 5 0. 36, P 5. 045) These results provide evidence of different effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT 1 antagonists on fibrinolysis and suggest that the PAI- 1 decrease induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is related to their action on insulin sensitivity and is not dependent on angiotensin II antagonism but rather on other mechanisms. It remains to be seen whether these findings apply to other patient populations than postmenopausal women. Am J Hyper...|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have largely been attributed to a class effect. However, this opinion is now increasingly challenged {{in view of the}} findings from recent clinical trials, which have demonstrated differential effects of ACE inhibitors, in particular with respect to secondary cardiovascular prevention outcomes. In this experimental study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with five different ACE inhibitors (enalapril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and <b>trandolapril)</b> at equihypotensive doses. All ACE inhibitors increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and activity in the aorta (both P <b>trandolapril</b> approximately quinapril approximately ramipril approximately enalapril (P< 0. 05 perindopril versus <b>trandolapril</b> and ramipril and P< 0. 01 perindopril versus enalapril, respectively). Levels of circulating nitrite/nitrate, the end-metabolites of nitric oxide, were also significantly affected by ACE inhibition, with the same order of potency. Our findings provide further evidence in favor of differential effects associated with ACE inhibitor therapy and suggest that the clinical benefits associated with these drugs may not solely reflect a class effect extending their benefit beyond blood pressure-lowering effec...|$|E
