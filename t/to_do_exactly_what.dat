[...] When they joined the band, they [...] "cleaned up and tightened our sound." [...] The new lineup's first song was [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt. II." [...] They began writing new material, {{and in a few}} months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new.

According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we wanted to because some of us were new." ...|$|E

Garrett Martin of the Boston Herald give high marks for the game's cutscenes and stated they were [...] "good enough to warrant a Cartoon Network TV show." [...] The reviewer from GameTrailers compared the game to a combination between the Nintendo game Ninja Gaiden and the modern open-world game [...] He also lauded the controls and stated that the scheme [...] "bends and yields to allow you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you want precisely when you want to." ...|$|E

During that time, in 1965, she became romantically involved with David Dalton, a professional photographer. She studied the way he worked during photo shoots, learning about how he set up shots and managed lighting and composition. When she began to do more of her own shoots, such as with music groups, he said he was [...] "astonished" [...] at how easily she was able to take control of unruly or uncooperative musicians. She was able to get her subjects <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she wanted without much fuss. Dalton said that shooting rock groups was [...] "a bloody pain in the neck. But with the lovely Linda, all this changed...Now their eyes were pinned on her." ...|$|E

"The Carolina {{fans that}} week were {{carrying}} around a poster {{with the image}} of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail," [...] Jay McCormick said. [...] "Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. [...] After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they are your rival, they're going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you told them not to do." ...|$|E

It really is “research from page to stage. ” For those with little theatre experience, Saldaña provides excellent suggestions for additional readings and comparisons {{of different types of}} plays. There is much merit in this book as a text for a qualitative research class or special interest class. The exercises provided are great way for students and researchers to be more reflective as they move towards ethnodrama or autoethnodrama as a new form of writing...|$|R

60|$|Be {{sure that}} in this temper of mind lies a sin and a snare. If we wish to keep up true {{independence}} and true self-respect in ourselves and our children, we should be careful to keep up respect for our forefathers. A shallow, sneering generation, which laughs at those who have gone before it, is ripe for disaster and slavery. We are not bound, of course--as those old Rechabites considered themselves bound--to <b>do</b> in everything <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> our forefathers <b>did.</b> For we are not under the law, but under grace; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty--liberty to change, improve, and develop as the world grows older, and (we may hope) wiser. But we are bound <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> not <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> our forefathers <b>did,</b> but what we may reasonably suppose {{that they would have}} done, had they lived now, and were they in our places. We are to obey them, not in the letter, but in the spirit.|$|R
40|$|The Book of Job {{displays}} {{well the}} reality of the human predicament. However, does the Book of Job provide an answer to the problem it so vividly displays: the existence of God and {{the reality of}} suffering? This paper is a quest for an answer, which, if correct, is no. The purpose of the book has less <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with an answer for why good people suffer and more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> God has <b>done,</b> and continues <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> rectify suffering, culminating in the Christ event. Stated simply, the Book of Job exists as a harbinger, to all those with eyes to see and ears to hear, to the life and ministry of Jesus Christ: explaining what to expect and how to respond to a suffering messiah. What follows should not be mistaken as an argument for the interpretation of the Book of Job but rather one suggesting a potential interpretation as an alternative to theodicy...|$|R

Now, {{after the death of}} her husband Bardolph, she can enjoy the new-found freedom of being able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and say <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she wants. But the return of her eccentric missionary sister, Ruth, together with some disturbing revelations forces Grace to confront the truth of her marriage. Set in a lush vicarage garden complete with real grass, plants and a stream with running water, the play is filled with sharp-edged comedy and probing wit with Penelope Keith giving a widely acclaimed performance as Grace.|$|R

[...] "I'll make a clean breast of it <b>to</b> Blyth, and <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he tells me, when I meet him at the turnpike."

Then you might have gone, notwithstanding, if you thought there was no danger, just as you went out upon the grass because you thought it was not wet, notwithstanding my saying that you must keep in the path.

Again, you see it is only a single line, and not above ten feet wide, which is against us, for the wider the line the better chance it has of being smashed by an explosion some forty feet below it. Well, we will have another look at the bridge and the waggons to-morrow. Of course the bridge is the great thing if it can be managed, though I don't say that blowing up the yard would not be a good thing if we can't make sure of the other.

40|$|Work {{for this}} essay {{began with a}} problem that will sound all too {{familiar}} {{to most of us}} in higher education: It has re-cently dawned upon administrators and faculty in many de-partments across our university’s curriculum that our stu-dents can’t write. Or more accurately, enough of our stu-dents write poorly enough that we have cause for concern. This concern is usually expressed in the unequivocal if vague resolution that something ought <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> But <b>exactly</b> <b>what?</b> And by whom? Our university has no institutionalized way of trying to solve this problem. There is no single writing course that all students are required to take. Indeed, students at our university can avoid taking any writ-ing course at all. Moreover, it is unlikely that our university will undertake any formal writing across the curriculum pro-gram. Such a program existed at our university a decad...|$|R

The challenge is deciding whether or not banking the unbanked must be pursued through personal or remote channels.

It found that banks are currently using an integrated approach combining personal and remote interaction and emphasising the promotion of financial literacy.

This was such an extremely natural, not to say habitual, state of things with Joe, {{that he was at}} least a couple of seconds in realising the fact that there was unusual cause for haste and vigorous action. Like a giant refreshed Joe leaped to his work. Every fibre of his huge frame was replete with energy, and his heart beat strong, but it beat steadily; not a vestige of a flutter was there, for his head was clear and cool. He knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was being <b>done.</b> Surprise did, indeed, fill him when he reflected that it was his own house which had caught fire, but that did not for a moment confuse him as to the certainty that the engine must be already out, and his comrades rushing to his assistance.|$|R
