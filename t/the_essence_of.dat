5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> his artistic statement.

5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried to retain <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> {{the world and}} rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E

5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E
5|$|During the Edo period Noh {{continued}} to be aristocratic art form supported by the shogun, the feudal lords (daimyōs), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While kabuki and joruri popular {{to the middle class}} focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} stage of development, the game had no {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode; it focused on the story instead of the cyberpunk element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> the Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of the co-op prototype was positive; testers said it fit with the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned the use of an online pass, unlike most EA games at that time.|$|E
