Enraged, he {{challenges}} Phineas to a fight right there, but boxing champion Evander Holyfield arrives and convinces them to instead fight in an organized thumb wrestling match later that day, which Buford accepts. Despite being cautioned by Phineas's friends Baljeet and Isabella, Holyfield trains Phineas through simple tasks, including punching a chain of sausages and playing Dance Dance Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Starting in November, {{the twins}} {{developed}} an on-screen relationship with The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), appearing in numerous backstage segments with them, and accompanying {{them to the}} ring. In February 2009, the storyline expanded to include John Morrison and The Miz, who flirted with the Bellas and took them on a date for Valentine's Day. The date provoked a rivalry between the teams of The Miz and Morrison and Primo and Carlito, with the four competing for the affection of the twins, who were seemingly unable to choose between them. On March 17 on ECW, Carlito and Primo, aiming for Morrison and The Miz, accidentally spat apples {{in the face of}} Brie. Nikki began <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> Brie's misfortune, and a fight broke out between the two, which led to Nikki leaving with The Miz and Morrison, while Brie stayed with Primo and Carlito. Brie won her first match over Nikki in a six-person intergender tag team match on SmackDown the following week. On ECW on March 31, Nikki pinned Brie in their first singles match against each other, after a distraction from Morrison and The Miz.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of alchemy soon developed an arcane and secretive technical vocabulary designed to conceal {{information from the}} uninitiated. To a large degree, this language is incomprehensible to us today, though {{it is apparent that}} readers of Geoffery Chaucer's Canon's Yeoman's Tale or audiences of Ben Jonson's The Alchemist were able to construe it sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|E

25|$|The {{alternate}} history novel Diverge And Conquer by Tom Anderson {{begins with}} Prince Frederick being exiled to the American Colonies in 1727 by George II after George stumbles at his coronation, leading Frederick <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> his father. Though Frederick is {{stripped of his}} title as Prince of Wales in favor of his brother William, after George II dies Frederick lays claim to the throne, defeats both William and the Jacobite rising of 1745, and establishes a more formalized structure to govern the American Colonies, thus bringing them closer to Britain and averting the American Revolution.|$|E
25|$|In Book Eight of the Odyssey, {{the blind}} singer Demodocus tells of how Aphrodite {{committed}} adultery with Ares, {{the god of}} war. The sun-god Helios saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus's bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a net of gold. The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both. Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> the captured adulterers, but Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon had sympathy for Ares and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares's release. Humiliated, Aphrodite returned to Cyprus, where she was attended by the Charites. This narrative probably originated as a Greek folk tale, originally independent of the Odyssey.|$|E

25|$|Macmillan {{had picked}} a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions. Ernest Bevin or Arthur Deakin {{would not have}} allowed such a strike, but Cousins felt {{compelled}} to support it, and Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell criticised the government in a speech at Glasgow. Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never forget a face, but I will make an exception for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E
500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E

500|$|Music halls, {{where both}} Nan and Kitty are employed—and put on display—as male impersonators, allow {{about half the}} novel's action and {{commentary}} on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers {{for the first time}} to perform as Kitty's partner and realises the impact of their double act together, she states, [...] "whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy". Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London [...] "swells": gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> themselves. Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.|$|E

In {{a review of the}} day, Johnston was describing how Ian Botham, while batting, had overbalanced and tried, but failed, to step over his stumps. Botham was consequently given out hit wicket. Agnew's comment on this action was: [...] "He just didn't quite get his leg over." [...] Botham had attracted a number of headlines during his career for his sexual exploits and in British English, [...] "" [...] is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse.|$|E
