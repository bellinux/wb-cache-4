5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> under which Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin {{took charge of the}} operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1–0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in draws. The series was originally intended as a four Test series; however the abandonment of the Second Test due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of the field at the SVR Stadium in Antigua led to the rapid inclusion of an additional game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five, rather than four match Test series.|$|E
5|$|From batting in the middle-order, Ganteaume was {{eventually}} promoted {{to open the}} batting as a theory at the time suggested that wicketkeepers might make good openers as they became accustomed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> while keeping wicket; Ganteaume neither believed this theory nor enjoyed being an opener. He scored his maiden first-class century in 1946; a second followed later in the year.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E
5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never say they would attend to something and then let it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in Nice for four years suddenly felt pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in Nice and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E

5|$|Nilofar {{originated}} {{from a low}} pressure area between India and the Arabian Peninsula. It developed into a depression on October25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October26. Quickly organizing due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions,</b> Nilofar developed a well-defined eye and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October28. At the time, Nilofar was expected to make landfall in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations. However, high wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and Nilofar degraded into a remnant low pressure area on October31 off the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Still {{commanded}} by its last wartime commander, Major General Eric Bols, the division began deployment to Palestine in 1945. The advance party arrived on 15September, {{followed by the}} Tactical Headquarters on 24September, then the 3rdParachute Brigade on 3October, the 6thAirlanding Brigade on 10October and the 2ndParachute Brigade on 22October. After arriving by sea at Haifa, the newly arrived troops were sent to camps in the Gaza Subdistrict to acclimatize <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions,</b> and to regain their fitness after the long sea journey from England. By {{the end of the}} month divisional headquarters was established at Bir Salim. The 2nd Parachute Brigade at remained at Gaza, the 3rd Parachute Brigade moved to the Tel Aviv and Jaffa region, while the 6th Airlanding Brigade moved to Samaria.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 world {{championship}} season opened with the Monaco Grand Prix. Brabham {{was affected by}} a cold, and qualified poorly before retiring when the BT19's gearbox failed. Surtees led the race in his Ferrari before his differential failed on lap 15; the race was won by Jackie Stewart in a 2-litre BRM P261. At the following Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit, Brabham survived an enormous 135miles per hour (215km/h) slide in the rain on the first lap. The shower eliminated half the field, including Stewart, who would miss the next race with his injuries. The BT19, using Goodyear tyres that were not suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions,</b> came home fourth of five classified finishers. Surtees won the race for Ferrari, the last before he quit the Italian team.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Groundhog Day tornado {{outbreak}} was a localized but devastating tornado {{event that}} took place in central Florida early on February 2, 2007. Early morning temperatures had risen well above average for the season; combined with increased moisture and a powerful jet stream, this created enough instability and wind shear for thunderstorms to rotate and spawn tornadoes. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions,</b> a long-tracked supercell formed and produced three tornadoes over one hour and seventeen minutes. The supercell resulted in a 70-mile (110-kilometer) trail of damage.|$|E
5|$|The Blues and the Greens {{were now}} more than simply sports teams. They gained {{influence}} in military, political, and theological matters, although {{the hypothesis that the}} Greens tended towards Monophysitism and the Blues represented Orthodoxy is disputed. It is now widely believed that neither of the factions had any consistent religious bias or allegiance, {{in spite of the fact}} that they operated in an environment fraught with religious controversy. According to some scholars, the Blue-Green rivalry contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> that underlay the rise of Islam, while factional enmities were exploited by the Sassanid Empire in its conflicts with the Byzantines during the century preceding Islam's advent.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} Grizzlies seasons had given average {{attendance}} {{in the middle}} third of the league.

5|$|The {{success of}} ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from {{its ability to}} adapt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The {{predictable}} flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators {{under the control of}} a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people {{in the context of an}} elaborate system of religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|With funding {{provided}} by the Fitch and the Jamaica Tourist Board, training was conducted in Canada and Austria {{in preparation for the}} 1988 Winter Olympics. Sepp Haidacher was recruited as a coach, and the team began to be featured in North American media with a comical angle. An agreement was reached with the Fédération International de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing in order to allow for entrance in both the four-man and the two-man events at the Games. Once in Calgary, the team conducted test runs on a frozen lake in order to get used <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions,</b> but Allen fell and was injured. Chris Stokes, who was only in Canada in order to support his brother Dudley, was added to the four-man team three days before the first run having never been in a bobsleigh before.|$|E
5|$|About 1,150 {{species of}} fungi have been {{recorded}} from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths {{as a result of}} evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces antarcticus, and Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.|$|E
