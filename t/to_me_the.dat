5|$|If I {{wanted to}} get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up. I think it's because it is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> least flawed; let me put it that way. It is the most {{successful}} for what I tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> ideal film— which I've never {{succeeded in}} making— {{would be as}} though the reel were behind one's eyes and you were {{projecting}} it yourself, seeing what you wish to see. This {{has a great deal}} in common with thought processes... That's why I think the camera is an eye as well as a mind. Everything we do with the camera has physiological and mental significance.|$|E
25|$|Due to its well-preserved colonial-era cityscape, {{a number}} of movies have been filmed in George Town, such as Anna and the King, Lust, Caution and You Mean the World <b>to</b> <b>Me,</b> <b>the</b> latter {{of which is the}} first movie to be filmed entirely in Penang Hokkien. Singaporean drama series, The Little Nyonya and , were also filmed within the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Furthermore, Penang Island became one of the pit-stops of The Amazing Race 16, The Amazing Race Asia 4 and The Amazing Race Asia 5.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of LGBT theatre in Singapore, {{it was only in}} the second half of the 1980s that gay writers started to explore the {{hitherto}} taboo area of homosexuality in their works. The licensing authority, however, was not quite ready so that in 1988, three plays with gay themes were banned from being performed. These were Eleanor Wong's Jackson on a Jaunt, Chay Yew's As If He Hears and Russell Heng's Lest The Demons Get <b>To</b> <b>Me.</b> <b>The</b> first two plays were subsequently staged in 1989/1990 after negotiations with the authority. The third was staged in 1992 after Singapore's culture policy was liberalised by its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{that there}} are many reasons for expounding the Madhyamakalankara, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, our {{incomparable}} guide, unbounded in his kindness, whose very name I hardly dare to pronounce, who is the very personification of the compassion of the abbot Bodhisattva, of the master Padmasambhava, and of King Trisongdetsen, who is the sovereign among the learned and accomplished, who is supreme Manjushri appearing {{in the form of a}} monk in saffron robes, and whose renown fills the world, gave <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Indian and Tibetan commentaries on the Madhyamakalankara, asking me to study them well and to compose a commentary. And as his diamondlike injunction came down upon my head, I earnestly gave myself to the task.|$|E
25|$|Marxian {{economics}} seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for <b>the</b> {{most part}} either false or obsolete or meaningless in application to contemporary economic phenomena.

25|$|The 1950-51 side under Freddie Brown...was full of inexperienced {{players and}} we paid the penalty. I'm sure {{if we had}} {{selected}} one or two solid players such as Jack Robertson, Dennis Brookes, Jack Ikin and Bill Edrich we would have won the Ashes - in spite of once again being caught on a glue-pot at Brisbane. Two Tests were lost by a very small margin and we won the last. In addition Denis Compton was a complete failure in the Tests, scoring only 53 runs in four matches. In spite of the critics the bowling proved adequate and Freddie Brown did a grand job {{in view of the}} shortcomings of the side. <b>To</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> annoying part was that we had players in England who could have won the series for us.|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff". He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand-off, explaining that [...] "instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I tilt up, and now I'm shooting up his nose almost, {{and it was kind}} of like very disorienting.

500|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{challenges}} Burke's rhetoric as much as, or more, {{than his}} political theory.
