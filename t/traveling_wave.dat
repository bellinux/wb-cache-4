Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes.

In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, <b>traveling</b> <b>wave</b> tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the 1 -dimensional complex Ginzburg–Landau equation(CGLE) {{which is a}} generic modulation equation describing the nonlinear evolution of patterns in fluid dynamics. The existence of a Hopf bifurcation from the basic solution was proved by Park [15].

25|$|If a <b>traveling</b> <b>wave</b> has a fixed {{shape that}} repeats in space or in time, it is a {{periodic}} wave.

25|$|The {{stationary}} wave {{can be viewed}} as the sum of two traveling sinusoidal waves of oppositely directed velocities. Consequently, wavelength, period, and wave velocity are related just as for a <b>traveling</b> <b>wave.</b> For example, the speed of light can be determined from observation of standing waves in a metal box containing an ideal vacuum.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{wavelength}} {{is most often}} applied to sinusoidal, or nearly sinusoidal, waves, because in a linear system the sinusoid is the unique shape that propagates with no shape change – just a phase change and potentially an amplitude change. [...] The wavelength (or alternatively wavenumber or wave vector) is a characterization of the wave in space, that is functionally related to its frequency, as constrained by the physics of the system. [...] Sinusoids are the simplest <b>traveling</b> <b>wave</b> solutions, and more complex solutions can be built up by superposition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the special}} case of dispersion-free and uniform media, waves other than sinusoids {{propagate}} with unchanging shape and constant velocity. In certain circumstances, waves of unchanging shape also {{can occur in}} nonlinear media; for example, the figure shows ocean waves in shallow water that have sharper crests and flatter troughs than those of a sinusoid, typical of a cnoidal wave, a <b>traveling</b> <b>wave</b> so named because it is described by the Jacobi elliptic function of m-th order, usually denoted as [...] [...] Large-amplitude ocean waves with certain shapes can propagate unchanged, because of properties of the nonlinear surface-wave medium.|$|E

Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, <b>traveling</b> <b>wave</b> tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices.
