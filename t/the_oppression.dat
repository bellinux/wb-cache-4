5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in <b>the</b> <b>oppression</b> of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced <b>the</b> <b>oppression</b> that their black counterparts faced.|$|E

5|$|Radical {{feminism}} {{considers the}} male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression {{and the total}} uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Conservative feminism is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. Libertarian feminism conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist. Ecofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for <b>the</b> <b>oppression</b> of women and destruction of the natural environment; ecofeminism {{has been criticized for}} focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.|$|E

40|$|Dalit {{literature}} articulates <b>the</b> <b>oppressions</b> and exploitations {{faced by}} Dalits in a caste ridden society. Dalit {{writing as a}} political form of writing records the cultural and social lives of Dalits and ideologically the writing offers a call for resistance. Bama is a Tamil Christian Dalit writer who writes {{about the lives of}} Dalit Women in Tamil Nadu. This paper attempts a look at Bama’s novel Sangathi as a site representing Dalit women and analyses how caste and gender act as tools of double oppression in their life. This critical feminist reading of the novel from a Dalit Feminist perspective focuses on how women are discriminated in the Paraiya community in their relations with different social institutions like education, marriages, electoral politics etc. Simultaneously, we see how this text through its form and theme builds up a resistance against <b>the</b> <b>oppressions</b> <b>the</b> women face in their everyday lives...|$|R
5|$|In Besançon, the Catholics had {{executed}} Protestants {{for religious}} reasons since 1528. Despite the punishment, prosecution, and banning of Protestants in Besançon, Archbishop Antoine struggled {{to contain the}} spread of Protestant ideas. The preaching of William Farel, Theodore Beza and John Calvin had resulted in people converting to Protestantism; Protestant propaganda, religious gatherings, and iconoclastic attacks on Catholic imagery had also maintained the Protestant community in Besançon. On 1 March 1562, the murder of Huguenots in Wassy, France began the French Wars of Religion. By then, Besançon had become part of an independent republic protected by the Holy Roman Empire, which mostly untouched {{in the beginning of}} the conflict. Despite <b>the</b> <b>oppression</b> in Besançon, many French Protestant reformers continued to flock to the city.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for black people to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape <b>the</b> <b>oppression</b> of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Jesuits {{who arrived}} in Mangalore in 1878, devoted {{themselves}} to the study and development of Konkani, and were thus responsible for {{the revival of the}} Konkani language in Mangalore. The origin of their literature dates to 1883, when Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei, an Italian Jesuit, published the first An English–Konkani Dictionary in Mangalore. He published a book on Konkani grammar in 1882, with a revised version in 1893. In 1912 the first Konkani periodical, Konknni Dirvem (Konkani Treasure), was published in Mangalore by Louis Mascarenhas. Popular Konkani periodicals published in Mangalore include Raknno (Guardian) (1938) by Mons. Sylvester Menezes, Konkan Daiz (Heritage of Konkani) (1958), and Kannik (Donation) (1965) by Raymond Miranda. The twentieth-century literature focused on themes like the suffering of the Mangalorean Catholics during their 15-year captivity at Seringapatam and <b>the</b> <b>oppression</b> of Goan Catholics during the Goa Inquisition. The first Konkani novel in Karnataka Aangel (1915), was written in the Kannada script by Joachim Santan Alvares. In Bombay—which had a small Mangalorean Catholic community—periodicals like Sukh-Dukh (Ups and Downs) (1948) by G.M.B. Rodrigues, Konknni Yuvak (Konkani Youth) (1949) by George Fernandes, Poinnari (Traveller) (1950) by V.J.P. Saldanha, and Divo (Lamp) (1995) by J.B. Moraes were published.|$|E

5|$|The secular popular {{tradition}} of music continued, despite {{attempts by the}} Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played. Large numbers of musicians continued to perform, including the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620). In the Highlands the seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairlock. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen in Lewis alone. <b>The</b> <b>oppression</b> of secular music and dancing began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 {{and the level of}} musical activity was reflected in a flood musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius (1725). The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay.|$|E
