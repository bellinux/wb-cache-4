Following <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation in western Slavonia, the 105th Brigade of the ZNG {{was raised in}} the city, largely equipped with small arms only, and plans for a blockade of the routes {{in and out of the}} city were developed. A crisis headquarters was set up to coordinate the defence of the city and the manufacture of weapons in industrial plants which had been modified for their production.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. <b>The</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the {{lighthouse}} underwent major repairs for its anniversary. As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was painted with high quality oil paint, which became the main contributor to <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of paint did not allow the limestone to dry. The mortar began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from <b>the</b> <b>Deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E

5|$|Due to {{a variety}} of factors, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s. Then on October 3, 1860, the board of trustees for the school resolved {{to begin the process of}} building a new primary hall to be used by the university. Reverend Alvin F. Waller was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds needed for a building. However, this was unsuccessful and on November 19, 1862, the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, Gustavus Hines, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, J. Lamson, and John H. Moores to prepare plans.|$|E

5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{wood of the}} {{exterior}} balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. On {{each of the three}} floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the mills}} {{built in the}} Derwent Valley for the cotton {{industry}} survive and were reused after {{the decline of the}} industry. Some have been reused. Most of the worker's housing survives and are still in used as homes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, local authorities in partnership with English Heritage attempted to prevent <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses and mills by giving advice to owners and using grants to undertake conservation work. When the application for World Heritage Site status was made in 2000, 26 of the 838listed buildings in the area were on English Heritage's At Risk Register and were in a state of disrepair.|$|E
5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria {{it was decided}} that the two countries should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was decided that the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.|$|E

5|$|The Hastings family {{suffered}} financially as {{a result}} of the war, and Ferdinando was imprisoned for debt in 1659. The family moved to Donington Hall, although some of the remains of the castle were repaired to form a house called Ashby Place, which lay on the north side of the site in the old outer court. Selina Hastings, the Countess of Huntingdon, lived there after 1746. With <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle and the departure of the Hastings, the neighbouring town also fell into decline. With the death of Francis Hastings in 1789, the castle was inherited by Francis Rawdon, who later became the Earl of Moira.|$|E
5|$|The Mall was {{initially}} a huge success, but its popularity declined as new retail outlets in Little Rock drew customers away. Then {{the departure of}} its anchor stores, beginning with the bankruptcy of Montgomery Ward in 2001, left {{more than half the}} building empty. Throughout the 1990s, the mall steadily declined as retailers and customers left. Due to the waning popularity and litigation involving <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, the mall was sold in 2007 to Strode Property Company, and the remaining few tenants were told to vacate. Demolition began for the primary structure in early 2008. Prior to this, associated buildings were razed beginning in December 2007, starting with the former Montgomery Ward auto center, as well as the former JCPenney auto center, which had been used several years as an automotive maintenance facility for the City of Little Rock.|$|E
5|$|The attacks {{also caused}} {{extensive}} damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40percent {{of the urban}} area of the 66 cities subjected to area attacks were destroyed. This included the loss of about 2.5million housing units, which rendered 8.5million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced {{the morale of the}} Japanese population, and postwar surveys conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks were {{the most important factor in}} convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese social fabric. However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle {{continued}} into the reign of Elizabeth I, who was advised {{that it no longer}} had any military utility. Robert Redhead, the tower keeper, became infamous at the time for taking parts of the castle to pieces and selling off the stonework for his own profit. Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this, Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford's Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because of the strength of local feeling.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reforming}} the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however viewed with suspicion {{not only by}} its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth and abhorred {{the thought of a}} resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 troops overall; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire, 200,000 each).|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{contributed to}} <b>the</b> <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish–Lithuanian relations and further discouraged the Lithuanians from joining Piłsudski's proposed Międzymorze federation. The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan {{to overthrow the}} Lithuanian government in a coup d'état. After the uprising, the Lithuanian police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup. They made mass arrests of Polish activists from August 27 {{to the end of}} September 1919. During the investigations, lists of PMO supporters were found; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania, arresting members.|$|E
