40|$|Objective: To assess {{hospital}} waste management in nonteaching hospitals of Lucknow city. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive {{study was conducted}} on the staffs of nonteaching hospitals of Lucknow from September 2012 to March 2013. A total of eight hospitals were chosen as the study sample size. Simple random sampling technique was used for the selection of <b>the</b> nonteaching <b>hospitals.</b> A pre-structured and pre-tested interview questionnaire was used to collect necessary information regarding <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> and biomedical waste (BMW) management of <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> <b>The</b> general information about the selected hospitals/employees of <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> was collected. Results: Mean {{hospital waste}} generated in <b>the</b> eight nonteaching <b>hospitals</b> of Lucknow was 0. 56 kg/bed/day. About 50. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> did not have BMW department and colored dustbins. In 37. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>hospitals,</b> there were no BMW records and segregation at source.

Conclusion: There is a need for appropriate training of staffs, strict implementation of rules, and continuous surveillance of <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> of Lucknow to improve the BMW management and handling practices...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> in 1720.

As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out alms to the poor.
