5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. He talks about how the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E

In keeping with the established <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> practice, but unlike the convention with today's internet mailboxes, Prestel Mailbox numbers were published by default, and were available via the Prestel computers in a dedicated directory accessible from page *486#.

25|$|The {{emergency}} <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> is {{a special}} case in the country's <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> plan. In the past, calls to the emergency <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though {{with the advent of}} electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they still may be able to access circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is set up so that once a call is made to an emergency <b>telephone</b> <b>number,</b> it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.|$|R

50|$|The NANP {{divides the}} territories {{of its members}} into {{numbering}} plan areas (NPAs) which are encoded numerically with a three-digit <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> prefix, commonly called the area code. Each telephone is assigned a seven-digit <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> unique only within its respective plan area. The <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> consists of a three-digit central office code and a four-digit station number. The combination of an area code and the <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> serves as a destination routing address in the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). For international call routing, the NANP has been assigned the international calling code 1 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The North American Numbering Plan conforms with ITU Recommendation E.164, which establishes an international numbering framework.|$|R
