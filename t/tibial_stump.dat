40|$|Antipersonnel mines {{are very}} {{commonly}} used in modern warfare. They produce a recognisable pattern of injury to the leg, which frequently spares the gastrocnemius muscle. Surgical amputation is often indicated. Medial gastrocnemius myoplastic below-knee amputation is suitable for these injuries. The technique permits cover and preservation of an acceptable <b>tibial</b> <b>stump...</b>|$|E
30|$|Animal studies (Fleming et al. 2008) {{showed that}} {{repairing}} a torn ACL to the <b>tibial</b> <b>stump,</b> does not improve sagittal plane laxity intra-operatively. The likely {{reasons for this}} are due to the inherent difficulties in placing a stitch in a short ligament stump composed primarily of longitudinal fibres. Even with grasping suture techniques there {{is likely to be}} significant suture sliding along longitudinal fascicles. However, anchoring of the suture to the tibial ACL footprint, particularly centrally/anteriorly did restore sagittal plane laxity, thus suggesting that a suture bridge from the tibial to the femoral side is crucial in restoring and maintaining early sagittal plane stability.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{integration}} of the tendon graft is a crucial prerequisite for successful ACL reconstruction. Histological studies showed that the human ACL remnants contain a cellular capacity for healing potential. The goal of this technical note is to describe an ACL reconstruction technique, using ACL remnants as a biological sleeve for the graft. In case of complete ACL rupture with a large remnant, the tibial tunnel was performed inside and through the ACL <b>tibial</b> <b>stump</b> by careful sequential drilling. Femoral tunnel placement was performed by an outside-in technique. The hamstring graft was kept attached to the tibia and routed through the ACL remnant to the femur. The aim of this technique is {{the preservation of the}} biological and mechanical properties of the ACL remnant. In order to preserve large remnants resulting in greater graft coverage, the best period to perform this reconstruction is during the first weeks after the injury...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{recovery}} is usually poor following {{peripheral nerve injury}} when reinnervation is delayed. Early innervation by sensory nerve has been indicated to prevent atrophy of the denervated muscle. It is hypothesized that early protection with sensory axons is adequate to improve functional recovery of skeletal muscle following prolonged denervation of mixed nerve injury. In this study, four groups of rats received surgical denervation of the tibial nerve. The proximal and distal <b>stumps</b> of the <b>tibial</b> nerve were ligated in all animals except {{for those in the}} immediate repair group. The experimental groups underwent denervation with nerve protection of peroneal nerve (mixed protection) or sural nerve (sensory protection). The experimental and unprotected groups had a stage II surgery in which the trimmed proximal and distal <b>tibial</b> nerve <b>stumps</b> were sutured together. After 3 months of recovery, electrophysiological, histological and morphometric parameters were assessed. It was detected that the significant muscle atrophy and a good preserved structure of the muscle were observed in the unprotected and protective experimental groups, respectively. Significantly fewer numbers of regenerated myelinated axons were observed in the sensory-protected group. Enhanced recovery in the mixed protection group was indicated by the results of the muscle contraction force tests, regenerated myelinated fiber, and the results of the histological analysis. Our results suggest that early axons protection by mixed nerve may complement sensory axons which are required for promoting functional recovery of the denervated muscle natively innervated by mixed nerve...|$|R
30|$|This was a {{retrospective}} {{study in which}} the medical records of 14 paediatric patients who had undergone surgery for gap nonunion of tibia with ipsilateral tibialization of the fibula between 1998 and 2003 were reviewed. The radiographs, clinical records and functional status of these 14 patients (10 boys, 4 girls), who {{ranged in age from}} 2 to 13 (average 8.35) years, were evaluated. All of these patients had tibial defects, either secondary to massive diaphyseal sequestration after osteomyelitis (infection group; 10 patients) or following open fracture of the tibia (trauma group; 4 patients). One patient in the trauma group had an ipsilateral open femur fracture with degloving injury to the popliteal region. One patient in the infection group had proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation, and another had pre-operative varus deformity at the ankle joint. All patients had segmental tibial loss ranging from 4.5 to 11 (average 7) cm. The inclusion criteria were patients aged < 15  years with a defect of > 4  cm, an intact fibula, no distal neurovascular deficit, no contraindication for surgery, an adequate <b>tibial</b> <b>stump</b> at both the proximal and distal level for fixation with fibula and a minimum follow-up period of 5  years. Two patients with similar clinical criteria were treated primarily with Ilizarov’s technique: one was lost to follow-up during the treatment and even did not turn up for frame removal, and the other patient, although doing well, was admitted to hospital five times due to problems related to frame readjustment and pin site infection.|$|E
