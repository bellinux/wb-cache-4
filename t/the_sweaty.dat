2500|$|Andrew Dreschel of the Hamilton Spectator stated proroguing {{parliament}} was {{the right}} move, imposing a [...] "cooling-off period on <b>the</b> <b>sweaty</b> rhetoric and dank distortions that have been steaming up the political spectrum". MP Bruce Stanton said the suspension of parliament until late January [...] "was perhaps the last tool in our basket {{to be able to}} allow parliamentarians to take a step back". Before Russell revealed the conditions Jean placed on her acceptance of Harper's advice, there was some concern that Jean's decision may have set a precedent for a prime minister to seek prorogation or dissolution when confronting a potential vote of non-confidence. Nelson Wiseman, {{a professor of political science}} at the University of Toronto, said the following of Harper's advice [...] "has been a blow to parliamentary democracy in Canada" [...] and Helen Forsey, daughter of Eugene Forsey, claimed that Jean's granting of prorogation was a shameful encouragement of [...] "flagrantly subversive behaviour by a Prime Minister" [...] and that, had he still been alive, the senior Forsey's [...] "denunciations would have been ringing from the rooftops." [...] Margaret Wente at the Globe and Mail opined that the Governor General was the only person who emerged from the situation with any gained respect.|$|E
2500|$|In early jam sessions, musicians would {{encourage}} {{one another to}} [...] "get down" [...] by telling one another, [...] "Now, put some stank on it!". At least as early as 1907, jazz songs carried titles such as Funky. The first example is an unrecorded number by Buddy Bolden, remembered as either [...] "Funky Butt" [...] or [...] "Buddy Bolden's Blues" [...] with improvised lyrics that were, according to Donald M. Marquis, either [...] "comical and light" [...] or [...] "crude and downright obscene" [...] but, {{in one way or}} another, referring to <b>the</b> <b>sweaty</b> atmosphere at dances where Bolden's band played. As late as the 1950s and early 1960s, when [...] "funk" [...] and [...] "funky" [...] were used increasingly in the context of jazz music, the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company. According to one source, New Orleans-born drummer Earl Palmer [...] "was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable." [...] The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving, insistent rhythm, implying a more carnal quality. This early form of the music set the pattern for later musicians. The music was identified as slow, sexy, loose, riff-oriented and danceable.|$|E

2500|$|In the video, Spears {{and fifteen}} dancers employ the same choreography seen in her with Spears looking over a balcony whilst singing with cars {{down in the}} distance. Spears is portrayed as a slave to the music who dances all day until she and the other dancers are sweaty and near dehydration, forcing them to search for water, Spears is {{standing}} by a mirror at the sink. Two alternative versions of the video clip {{can be found on}} the [...] DVD released on November 9, 2004. The music video was nominated in three categories at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, and Best Choreography. The video clip for [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] was noted for its influence from Janet Jackson, with one review saying [...] "Spears’ main musical and visual influence has not been Madonna but Janet Jackson, particularly in her visual element. The Jackson influence can be seen in the video for 'I’m A Slave 4 U', and it continues through 'Me Against the Music,' 'Boys,' and 'My Prerogative,' as well as her live performances in general." [...] The video ranked #1 in the list of the [...] "50 Sexiest Music Videos of All-Time" [...] published by Canadian music channel MuchMusic in 2007. An official remix video used the [...] "Miguel Migs Petalpusher Vocal Mix" [...] was also released. There are another 2 unreleased remix videos using the Thunderpuss Club Mix and the Thunderpuss Dark Mix. Nearly 10 years later in 2011, the video would be compared to her [...] "Till The World Ends" [...] music video. Several references from the [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] video were made in the video for [...] "Till The World Ends", such as the dancers crowding around her and <b>the</b> <b>sweaty</b> dancers scene.|$|E
60|$|Brackton's {{ramshackle}} establishment stood {{down at the}} end of {{the village}} street. There was not a sawed board in all that structure, and some of the pine logs showed how they had been dropped from the bluff. Brackton, a little old gray man, with scant beard, and eyes like those of a bird, came briskly out to meet an incoming freighter. The wagon was minus a hind wheel, but the teamster had come in on three wheels and a pole. <b>The</b> <b>sweaty,</b> dust-caked, weary, thin-ribbed mustangs, and the gray-and-red-stained wagon, and the huge jumble of dusty packs, showed something of what the journey had been.|$|E
6000|$|The {{successor}} of the sheet-iron {{hamlet of}} the mangrove marshes has that other Australian specialty, the Botanical Gardens. We cannot have these paradises. The {{best we could}} {{do would be to}} cover a vast acreage under glass and apply steam heat. But it would be inadequate, the lacks would still be so great: the confined sense, the sense of suffocation, the atmospheric dimness, <b>the</b> <b>sweaty</b> heat--these would all be there, in place of the Australian openness to the sky, the sunshine and the breeze. Whatever will grow under glass with us will flourish rampantly out of doors in Australia.--[The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is an authoritative record of, was at Sandhurst, in January, 1862. The thermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade. In January, 1880, the heat at Adelaide, South Australia, was 172 degrees in the sun.] ...|$|E

6000|$|QUALITIES OF LITERATURE. The first {{significant}} {{thing is the}} essentially artistic quality of all literature. All art is the expression of life in forms of truth and beauty; or rather, it is the reflection of some truth and beauty which are in the world, but which remain unnoticed until brought to our attention by some sensitive human soul, just as the delicate curves of the shell reflect sounds and harmonies too faint to be otherwise noticed. A hundred men may pass a hayfield and see only <b>the</b> <b>sweaty</b> toil and the windrows of dried grass; but here is one who pauses by a Roumanian meadow, where girls are making hay and singing as they work. He looks deeper, sees truth and beauty where we see only dead grass, and he reflects what he sees in a little poem in which the hay tells its own story: ...|$|E

5000|$|Whether or not {{the show}} is racist, many contend that {{productions}} of it should continue as {{it serves as a}} history lesson of American race relations. According to African-American opera singer Phillip Boykin, who played the role of Joe in a 2000 tour, Whenever a show deals with race issues, it gives <b>the</b> audience <b>sweaty</b> palms. I agree with putting it on the stage and making the audience think about it. We see where we came from so we don't repeat it, though we {{still have a long way}} to go.

5000|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} major critics. Andy Webster of The New York Times said that [...] "rarely has a movie so humorously illustrated {{the meaning of}} 'frenemy'", David Edelstein of New York Magazine called Fort Tilden [...] "a brisk comedy packed with sharply drawn characters", and Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times said that the film [...] "has an easy, funky groove and captures <b>the</b> <b>sweaty</b> perfection of a New York City summer, where things always look better on Instagram".|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing Debut, Heather Phares of AllMusic, {{noted that}} [...] "Björk's playful energy ignites the dance-pop-like [...] "Big Time Sensuality" [...] {{and turns the}} genre on its head with [...] "There's More to Life Than This." [...] Recorded live at the Milk Bar Toilets, it captures <b>the</b> dancefloor's <b>sweaty,</b> claustrophobic groove, but her impish voice gives it an almost alien feel". The website cites the track as an All Media Network-pick, and in a track review, Stacia Proefrock defined the track as an [...] "aggressive, screechy dance number" [...] that [...] "While not {{scraping}} {{the top of the}} charts... was part of an album unusual enough to stand out among its fellow pop releases as a quirky and complex experiment that worked most of the time".|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "dear little ship" [...] {{presented}} a horrid picture of confusion, and its occupants of weariness and ill-humour.
