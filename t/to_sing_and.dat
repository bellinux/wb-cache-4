5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys.

Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>and</b> play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E

5|$|When rehearsals {{began in}} October 1874, the {{orchestra}} had difficulties with the score, finding some parts unplayable. The chorus likewise declared {{some of their}} music impossible <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>and</b> were dismayed {{that they had to}} act as individuals, smoking and fighting onstage rather than merely standing in line.
