40|$|Abstract. Five {{methods are}} used to measure values of {{circumferential}} Young’s modulus and three methods {{are used to}} obtain shear modulus using the closed and open ring specimens. Based {{on the assumption that}} the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a strain gage must yield the correct value of Young’s modulus, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a closed ring specimen gives more consistent results than the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> an open ring specimen. For the simplicity of measurement, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a closed ring specimen under compression can be used as long as the thickness of the used specimen remains thin enough to neglect the effects of shear deformation. To measure the shear modulus, G 12, both <b>techniques</b> <b>using</b> the open and closed ring seems to have the same trend as a function of thickness. As expected from the loading scheme, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> an open ring gives more consistent results for the shear modulus...|$|R

5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the <b>techniques</b> <b>used</b> to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Small-molecule and {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{differ in}} the range of possible <b>techniques</b> <b>used</b> to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E
