5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist <b>thinking.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. <b>Thinking</b> <b>to</b> disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is a fundamental}} tool in a child's education. Today, most educational opportunities are tied to one's performance on standardized tests that are often multiple choice in nature. When a student contemplates the possible answers available, they use convergent <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> weigh alternatives within a construct. This allows one to find a single best solution that is measurable.|$|E

25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} is also linked to knowledge as it involves manipulating existing knowledge {{by means of}} standard procedures. Knowledge is another important aspect of creativity. It {{is a source of}} ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. Convergent {{thinking is}} used as a tool in creative problem solving. When an individual is using critical <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> solve a problem they consciously use standards or probabilities to make judgments. This contrasts with divergent thinking where judgment is deferred while looking for and accepting many possible solutions.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} decade in Nyasaland after {{returning}} from Lynchburg, Virginia, Chilembwe had reasonable success. After 1910 his mission faced rising debt as support from its American backers dried up. His personal life was clouded {{by the death of}} a daughter, his asthma attacks and his declining eyesight and general health. These problems increased Chilembwe's bitterness toward Europeans in Nyasaland, and moved him towards thoughts of revolt. However, the outbreak and effects of the First World War was the key factor in moving him from merely <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> planning action, which he believed would lead to the deliverance of the African people of Nyasaland.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus {{mentions that}} Agricola, while governor of Roman Britain (AD 78 - 84), considered conquering Ireland, believing {{it could be}} held with one legion plus auxiliaries and entertained an exiled Irish prince, <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> use him as a pretext for a possible invasion of Ireland. This Roman author tells us that around those years Agricola had with him an Irish chieftain (may be Tuathal Techtmar) who later returned to conquer Ireland with an army. Excavations at sites linked to the tale of Tuathal have produced Roman material of the late 1st or early 2nd centuries. It would be consistent for Tuathal to have been that Irish chieftain.|$|E

He joins the Doctor and Vicki as a companion in the following serial, The Time Meddler, when they discover that he stowed-away in the TARDIS after having escaped the burning Mechanoid City.

25|$|In 1956, {{he applied}} the same <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> the Riemann–Roch theorem, {{which had already}} {{recently}} been generalized to any dimension by Hirzebruch. The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem was announced by Grothendieck at the initial Mathematische Arbeitstagung in Bonn, in 1957. It appeared in print in a paper written by Armand Borel with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. He went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which were then {{in a state of}} flux and under discussion in Claude Chevalley's seminar; he outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians.|$|E

25|$|Minye Kyawswa {{brought a}} fresh <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> Ava's battle plan. Instead of {{directly}} attacking the well-defended Pegu capital region, he would attack {{what he believed}} were less defended regions. In late 1410, the prince invaded the Irrawaddy delta by river and land with an army (7000 men, 600 horses, and 40 elephants) and a navy that transported 7000 men. Combined Ava forces proceeded to attack the key delta cities of Myaungmya and Bassein (Pathein). But the prince found that the key delta cities were well fortified and prepared for long sieges. He pulled back his forces to Prome, and invaded Arakan in early 1411. There, he successfully drove out Pegu-installed vassals, and appointed Ava's commanders as governor-generals.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} is a theoretical {{approach in the}} social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations – that is, the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection in human evolution. Adaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in evolutionary biology. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> psychology, arguing that the modularity of mind {{is similar to that of}} the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of Hanover {{was only about}} 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, {{to be a major}} courtier to the House of Brunswick was quite an honor, {{especially in light of the}} meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The British Act of Settlement 1701 designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King William III and his sister-in-law and successor, Queen Anne, were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the British Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is often used}} in conjunction with divergent thinking. Divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing manner, where many creative ideas are generated and evaluated. Multiple possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. After the process of divergent thinking has been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> decision making strategies are used leading to a single-best, or most often correct answer. Examples of divergent thinking include using brainstorming, free writing and creative thinking {{at the beginning of the}} problem solving process to generate possible solutions that can be evaluated later. Once a sufficient number of ideas have been explored, convergent thinking can be used. Knowledge, logic, probabilities and other decision-making strategies are taken into consideration as the solutions are evaluated individually in a search for a single best answer which when reached is unambiguous.|$|E

He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E
