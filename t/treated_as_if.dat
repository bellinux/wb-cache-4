5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments {{are believed to have}} their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{case for}} computational chemistry is the gas-phase chemistry, {{in which a}} substance is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was a gas to eliminate the necessity of taking interactions between molecules in account. Research by multiple authors has been undertaken on dubnium pentachloride: it has been calculated {{to be consistent with}} the periodic laws by exhibiting properties of a compound of a d-block element. For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. One property dubnium pentachloride is expected to show is its increased (compared to its tantalum analog) covalence: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in March 2008 as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, the second of two cinematic parts. It was also revealed that Yates would direct the film and that Kloves would write the screenplay. Kloves started work on the second part's script in April 2009, after the first part's script was completed. Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was filmed back-to-back with Deathly Hallows– Part 1 from 19 February 2009 to 12 June 2010, and <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were one film during principal photography. Reshoots were confirmed to begin {{in the winter of}} 2010 for the film's final, and epilogue scenes, which had originally taken place at London King's Cross station. The filming took place at Leavesden Film Studios on 21 December 2010, marking the end of the Harry Potter series after ten years of filming.|$|E

25|$|Early in the {{development}} of high-level programming languages, the introduction of the block enabled the construction of programs in which a group of statements and declarations could be <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were one statement.

25|$|The {{concept of}} a Primary Urban Area was created {{in an attempt to}} enable {{economic}} and social comparisons between cities using definitions less arbitrary than the administrative boundaries of local authorities, but avoiding one problem of using the Urban Areas defined by the Office for National Statistics - that sprawling conurbations such as the West Yorkshire Urban Area, containing multiple distinct settlements with large degrees of physical and social independence, but that happen to touch, end up being <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were a single city.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to restrictive behavior, parents {{are advised to}} provide daily sessions in which older children are <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were babies to create attachment.

25|$|Non-tomographic {{variants}} on this method, {{referred to}} as single particle analysis, use images of multiple (hopefully) identical objects at different orientations to produce the image data required for three-dimensional reconstruction.
