5|$|In 1988, the Air Force {{decided to}} close {{three of its}} nuclear weapons {{stations}} at its SAC bases. In addition to Loring, other bases around the world were scaled back. As the B-1B Lancer was now predicted to become the mainstay of nuclear defense for the country, Loring was deemed unnecessary for nuclear weapons stationing. That same year, fears began to surface that Loring would be an {{on the list of}} the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. As a result, the community began <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> the base, which at the time included 3,800 military personnel, 1,000 civilian employees, generated an $80 million payroll the previous year, and was the subject of $34 million in construction services.|$|E
5|$|By September 1944, Ostojić {{had been}} {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel, and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia. In early September 1944, as Mihailović had been removed as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force with {{the demise of the}} Purić government-in-exile, Ostojić tried to make contact with Allied forces in Italy, and agreed with Lukačević to issue a proclamation to the people explaining {{that they were going to}} attack the Germans. After 12 September 1944, when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> Tito, he and Baćović warned Mihailović that their men were losing their will to fight the Partisans. Concerned that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans, he then contacted the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) liaison officer with the Chetniks, Colonel Robert H. McDowell, but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command.|$|E

25|$|Several other {{potential}} leadership contenders, such as Brian Tobin and Allan Rock, declined {{to enter the}} contest. John Manley's attacks on Martin's refusal to disclose his campaign contributors did little to dent the latter's commanding lead and Manley eventually conceded the race.

Meanwhile, Chauncey's schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, were bombarding the fort and Government House battery.

25|$|In the meantime, Rostom’s {{willingness}} {{to cooperate with}} his Safavid suzerains won for Kartli a large measure of autonomy and relative peace and prosperity. However, the nobles and the populace of Kakheti continued <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> the exiled Teimuraz {{in the hope of}} ending their subjection to Iran. In order to end resistance in Kakheti once and for all, Shah Abbas II revived a plan to populate the country with the Turkic nomads, a measure that incited a general uprising in 1659. The rebels succeeded in expelling the nomads but still had to grudgingly accept the shah’s suzerainty.|$|E

Under {{the direction of}} Chief Justice John Marshall, the Supreme Court issued a series of opinions reinforcing {{the role of the}} national government. These decisions included McCulloch v Maryland and Gibbons v Ogden; both of which reaffirmed the supremacy of the national government over the states.

Wahsudan imprisoned him and sent Daisam to Azerbaijan, in the hopes that he could aid the sons of Marzuban against an army sent by Rukn al-Daula and led by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Razziq. The latter soon decided to withdraw, allowing Daisam to take over Azerbaijan.

On October 16, students and workers took to the streets and erected barricades. To try to preserve order, the police fought them and killed several students. Although a public funeral had been planned for the students, the Odessa city governor, D. M. Neidhart, had the bodies buried secretly <b>to</b> limit <b>rallying</b> <b>around</b> the deaths. On October 17, the police and military continued to monitor the streets, though no major confrontations occurred. About 4000 workers, including many Jews, went on strike.|$|R
25|$|However, {{not all of}} the Army of the Cumberland had fled. Thomas's four {{divisions}} {{still held}} their lines around Kelly Field and a strong defensive position was attracting men from the right flank to Horseshoe Ridge. James Negley had been deploying artillery there on orders from Thomas to protect his position at Kelly Field (although Negley inexplicably was facing his guns to the south instead of the northeast). Retreating men rallied in groups of squads and companies and began erecting hasty breastworks from felled trees. The first regimental size unit to arrive in an organized state was the 82nd Indiana, commanded by Col. Morton Hunter, part of Brannan's division. Brannan himself arrived at Snodgrass Hill at about noon and began to implore his men <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> Hunter's unit.|$|E

25|$|The {{flag was}} adopted when Syria gained its {{independence}} on 17 April 1946. The flag's green colour stood for the Rashidun, white represented the Umayyads and black symbolised the Abbasids. Originally, the three red stars represented the three districts of Syria, Aleppo, Damascus, and Deir ez-Zor. In 1936, the Sanjak of Latakia and Jebel Druze {{were added to}} Syria, and {{the representation of the}} three stars was changed, with the first representing the districts of Aleppo, Damascus and Deir ez-Zor, the second Jebel Druze, and the final star representing Sanjak of Latakia. The flag was officially hoisted in Damascus on 11 June 1932, but was previously flown in Aleppo on 1 January 1932. The flag was used as a symbol for Syrians <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> when France reneged on its agreement to leave the country, due to the outbreak of World War II. The standard was used until the creation of the United Arab Republic, a state union of Syria and Egypt, in 1958. After the collapse of the United Arab Republic, Syria used the UAR's flag until 28 September 1961, when it was replaced by the independence flag to disassociate Syria from the former failed union.|$|E
25|$|At this dire point, Gen. Jackson rode to {{that part}} of the field to rally the men and came upon his old brigade finally being brought up to {{reinforce}} the line. Intending to inspire the troops there, he attempted to brandish his sword; however, due to the infrequency with which he drew it, it had rusted in its scabbard and he was unable to dislodge it. Undaunted, he unbuckled the sword from his belt and waved it, scabbard and all, over his head. He then grabbed a battle flag from a retreating standard bearer and yelled at his men <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> <b>around</b> him. The Stonewall Brigade, heartened by their commander, launched into the Union troops and drove them back. By this point, Banks's men were becoming tired and disorganized, with their ammunition nearly gone. Without any support, his men had been unable to follow up on their initial success. In their zeal, the Stonewall Brigade pursued the Federals as they fell back, but soon found themselves beyond the Confederate line and without support. The Federals reformed and attacked, driving the 4th and 27th Virginia back. But the actions of the Stonewall Brigade gave the Confederate line time to reform and A.P Hill's troops to come up and fill the gaps from Winder's broken regiments. Jackson ordered Hill and Ewell to advance. He encountered Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch (a career politician) making a lengthy speech to his troops, and urged him to press forward. The Union right immediately collapsed. Ewell, having difficulty silencing his guns, was delayed, but the Union left began to waver at the sight of Crawford's retreat and were finally broken by a charge down Cedar Mountain by Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade.|$|E

If Sabal was placed in charge, he brutally executes all of Amita's supporters and turns Bhadra into Tarun Matara, a religious symbol for the country <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> <b>around.</b> Ajay then has one final choice; to either kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.|$|E

According to Portnov, Viatrovych tried {{to prove that the}} OUN leadership issued no order for the extermination of the Polish minority, and the killings in Volhynia were a spontaneous rebellion of Ukrainian peasants, provoked by the Poles. It was Motyka's view that Viatrovych achieved that goal by rhetorical devices and by ignoring inconvenient facts. Andrzej Zięba considered that the book passed over certain materials or engaged in their outright falsification in order to [...] "absolve" [...] OUN-UPA and <b>to</b> <b>rally</b> Ukrainians <b>around</b> nationalist positions. The aim of the book, Portnov argued, was to serve UPA apologetics and political motives.|$|R
