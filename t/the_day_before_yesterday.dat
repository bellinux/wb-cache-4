25|$|<b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> I {{was present}} at an {{operation}} performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E
500|$|A May 1, 1917 {{review by}} The New York Times praised her natural talent, with some {{reservations}} about the unpolished quality of her voice. Her ability to capture {{the spirit of the}} pieces was also praised: [...] "...her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} Edgar Allan Poe was buried, a long {{obituary}} {{appeared in the}} New York Tribune signed [...] "Ludwig". It was soon published throughout the country. The piece began, [...] "Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday.</b> This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it." [...] "Ludwig" [...] was soon identified as Rufus Wilmot Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.|$|E

60|$|It {{was when}} the shades of the next evening but one were {{beginning}} to fall, 'ere yet the silver beams of Luna touched the earth, that four forms might have been descried slowly advancing towards the weeping willow on {{the borders of the}} pond, the now deserted scene of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday's</b> agonies and triumphs. On a nearer approach, and by a practised eye, these might have been identified as the forms of the Pirate-Colonel with his Bride, and of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday's</b> gallant prisoner with his Bride.|$|R

500|$|The {{witty and}} playful side of Creangă's personality, which became notorious {{during his time}} at Junimea and {{constituted}} {{a significant part of}} his appeal, was reflected into a series of anecdotes. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow Junimists in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself [...] "for against" [...] during a two-option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle {{and the two of them}} on either side, while comparing it to the crucifixion scene and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of Romanian humor. The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who would ask him for money: [...] "not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> and last week and last week and throughout life". His joyfulness complemented his overall Epicureanism and his gourmand habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink. Overall, Eduard Gruber's report contended, Creangă's writing relied on him being [...] "a strong sensual and auditive type", and a [...] "very emotional" [...] person.|$|E

2500|$|Madame de Gaulle {{asked the}} {{undertaker}} {{to provide the}} same type of simple oak casket that he used for everyone else, but because of the General's extreme height, the coffin cost $9 more than usual. He specified that his tombstone bear the simple inscription of his name and his years of birth and death. Therefore, it simply states, [...] "Charles de Gaulle, 1890–1970". At the service, President Pompidou said, [...] "de Gaulle gave France her governing institutions, her independence and her place in the world." [...] André Malraux, the writer and intellectual who served as his Minister of Culture, called him [...] "a man of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> and the day after tomorrow." [...] De Gaulle's family turned the La Boisserie residence into a foundation. It currently houses the Charles de Gaulle Museum.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have the}} honor to acquaint your {{excellency}} that since my letter of the19 ..... the Herring and Pilchard have been launched, the former coppered {{and the inside}} work nearly compleat, the latter not yet coppered.

The Capelin and Mackeral will not be launched {{until the middle of}} next month and I fear will not be ready to proceed to Newfoundland this winter. There being no iron ballast sent out for the schooners is of great inconvenience and the Navy Board have positively forbid any being purchased. The schooners being very buoyant obliges us to fill the hold with stone and carry all the water and provisions between decks so that the men have very little room. They are fine vessels of the kind and have the appearance of fast sailors. I beg leave to observe to your excellency that there being no establishment for the supply of necessaries, we are supplying them on the most reasonable terms possible and mean to forward the vouchers to the victualling board. The Officers and men are all in perfect health. I have the honor to remain &&& ...|$|E

Somehow or other,' added Mrs Nickleby, after a momentary pause, 'they always ARE journeyman shoemakers who do these things in France, according to the papers. I don't know how it is--something in the leather, I suppose.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Sparkler's lordship was {{fortunately}} one {{of those}} shelves on which a gentleman {{is considered to be}} put away for life, unless there should be reasons for hoisting him up with the Barnacle crane to a more lucrative height. That patriotic servant accordingly stuck to his colours (the Standard of four Quarterings), and was a perfect Nelson in respect of nailing them to the mast. On the profits of his intrepidity, Mrs Sparkler and Mrs Merdle, inhabiting different floors of the genteel little temple of inconvenience to which the smell of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday's</b> soup and coach-horses was as constant as Death to man, arrayed themselves to fight it out in the lists of Society, sworn rivals. And Little Dorrit, seeing all these things as they developed themselves, could not but wonder, anxiously, into what back corner of the genteel establishment Fanny's children would be poked by-and-by, and who would take care of those unborn little victims.|$|R

60|$|So quietly did the mowing {{of the old}} scythe go on, {{that fully}} three months had passed unnoticed since the two English {{brothers}} had been laid in one tomb in the strangers' cemetery at Rome. Mr and Mrs Sparkler were established in their own house: a little mansion, rather of the Tite Barnacle class, quite a triumph of inconvenience, with a perpetual smell in it of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>yesterday's</b> soup and coach-horses, but extremely dear, as being exactly in {{the centre of the}} habitable globe. In this enviable abode (and envied it really was by many people), Mrs Sparkler had intended to proceed at once to the demolition of the Bosom, when active hostilities had been suspended by the arrival of the Courier with his tidings of death. Mrs Sparkler, who was not unfeeling, had received them with a violent burst of grief, which had lasted twelve hours; after which, she had arisen to see about her mourning, and to take every precaution that could ensure its being as becoming as Mrs Merdle's. A gloom was then cast over more than one distinguished family (according to the politest sources of intelligence), and the Courier went back again.|$|R
60|$|When we got up-stairs to {{his room}} he got me a coarse shirt and a {{roundabout}} and pants of his, and I put them on.

I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.|$|R
