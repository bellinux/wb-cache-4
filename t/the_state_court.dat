5|$|Green, however, had {{the support}} of Bernard G.

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E
5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E

5000|$|When {{a federal}} court rules on an issue of <b>state</b> law, <b>the</b> federal <b>court</b> must follow the {{precedent}} of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>courts,</b> under <b>the</b> Erie doctrine.

5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|Thompkins appealed his {{conviction}} {{on grounds that}} included suppression of his admission—that he had invoked and not waived his right to remain silent—and deficient representation related to improper jury instructions, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Thompkins' Miranda claim. Thompkins then filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal District Court but it denied his request. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, holding that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins' right to remain silent.|$|E
5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals, the highest court in the state.

On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E
