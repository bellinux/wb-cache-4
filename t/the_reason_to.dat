5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{returns to}} Sarawak, where {{he stays in}} the {{circular}} 'head-house' of a Dyak village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour, and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges, as well as ferns and Nepenthes pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds {{the only place in}} his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|E
5|$|In 189 BC, {{the hostages}} taken by Rome, {{excluding}} Nabis' son, who fell ill and died, {{were allowed to}} return to Sparta. Still deprived of any port and suffering from political and economic problems from having the hostile exiles close by and not having access to the sea, the Spartans captured the city of Las, which was the home of many exiles {{and a member of the}} Union of free Laconians. The Acheans officially adopted this as <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> finish Spartan independence once and for all. They demanded the surrender of the people responsible for the attack. The culprits responded by murdering thirty pro-Achaean citizens, seceding from the League and requesting Roman tutelage. The Romans, who wanted to see division in the League, did nothing about the situation. In 188, Philopoemen entered northern Laconia with an army and the Spartan exiles who insisted on returning to Sparta. He first massacred eighty anti-Achaeans at Compasium, and then had the wall that Nabis built around Sparta demolished. Philopoemen then restored the exiles and abolished Spartan law, introducing Achaean law in its place. Thus ended Sparta's role as a major power in Greece, while Achaea became dominant throughout the Peloponnese.|$|E

25|$|Before the Italian Grand Prix, Häkkinen {{announced}} that he would be on a sabbatical for the 2002 season, citing <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> spend more time with his family. His seat was taken by fellow countryman Kimi Räikkönen in 2002. Häkkinen later stated that fear after crashes during practice for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix and the 2001 Australian Grand Prix as well as a loss of a desire to compete for race victories were factors. He was forced into another retirement during the race due to a gearbox issue. He managed to race to his final victory of his career in the United States despite incurring a grid penalty, and ended the season with a fourth-place finish in Japan. Häkkinen finished the season 5th in the Drivers' Championship, with 37 points.|$|E

Before the final race at the Hockenheim, Coulthard announced his retirement from motor racing, citing <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> spend more time with his family and to concentrate on his co-commentary role with the BBC, as well as managing his off-track businesses.

25|$|Pelmeni {{and other}} frozen foods were {{produced}} under {{the brand name}} Daria, named after the daughter of Oleg Tinkoff. A Greek called Athanasius, who distributed ravioli production equipment in Russia, gave Tinkoff this idea while in the sauna. Production was launched in early 1998 in Peterhof and in the beginning it made products under the trademark Smak under license from Andrey Makarevich company. After the conflict with the licensor, the brand name changed to Smak St. Petersburg. Economic crisis was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> create its own brand: the new brand helped increase the market share. The new plant, which opened in December 1998, {{at the site of}} a former Technoshock warehouse on Predportovaya street in St. Petersburg, originally produced only Daria. In addition, Tinkoff made products under the brands of Tolsty kok, Dobry product and Tsar-batyushka.|$|E
25|$|The {{demonstration}} {{also led}} to a conflict with the Queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, {{in the autumn of}} 1790. That autumn, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of Drottningholm Palace well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent, which made him accuse her of having been manipulated by the oppositional of the female courtiers to participate in the political demonstration and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving: he suspected Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak of politics in her presence, and <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> why she wished to leave was reportedly for health reasons, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an ear infection.|$|E
25|$|One {{traditional}} {{industry is}} {{the making of}} shoes and other leather items, especially in León.

In 2010, Volkswagen announced a new motor plant to be built in Silao. The project is projected to cost 550 million USD and will employ 700 people making 330,000 motors per year starting in 2013. A spokesman for the company acknowledged that part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> build the plant was the existence of a General Motors plant in the same area as well as the existence of the Parque Industrial Puerto Interior which offers access to different transportation modes. The Centro de Innovación (Innovation Center) of Microsoft was inaugurated in 2010 in León.

25|$|During {{their second}} reign as champions, the Harts met the Rockers again, {{this time in}} a series title and non-title matches. On October 30, 1990 Jannetty and Michaels did {{actually}} defeat the Hart Foundation in a {{two out of three}} falls match in Fort Wayne, Indiana to seemingly win the title. However, the WWE (WWF) has never officially recognized The Rockers' champion status. During the match the top rope broke by accident making the match a disjointed affair that would require serious clean up before it could be shown on TV. The Rockers actually defended the WWF Tag Team title against Power and Glory (Paul Roma and Hercules) on November 3, 1990. Shortly after November 3 it was decided to not air the title change and that the title would revert to the Hart Foundation. In his book Michaels claims that the Hart Foundation had politicked to keep the title. Michaels claim is contradicted by other claims, including one that the WWF had actually fired Neidhart, and another that his contract had ended and an agreement to re-sign hadn't been reached which forced the title change, but that after the match the two sides came to an agreement and Neidhart was brought back with the broken ring rope used as <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> nullify the match. The Rockers were never officially credited with a title win but footage from the match was shown prior to Jannetty’s WWF return in 1995. The match can be seen in its entirety on the DVD The Shawn Michaels Story: Heartbreak & Triumph. Because it never aired, the match was not clipped and thus is shown in full with no commentary; the only edit being after the second fall when a ring crew arrived to reattach the broken rope.|$|E

500|$|As AGF commander, McNair {{worked to}} solve the problem of how to {{integrate}} replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties. [...] Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat. [...] In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war. [...] New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies who had been killed or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences. In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to teach them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.|$|E
