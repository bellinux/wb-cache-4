40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the clinical value of the saccharin test as a practical and simple measure of mucociliary clearance, nasal mucociliary clearance (NMCC) and ciliary ultrastructure were studied in 22 patients suspected of having primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) based on the saccharin test. Ten patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of PCD had a pathological response to the saccharin <b>test</b> (<b>transport</b> time greater than 60 minutes), and this was consistently associated with ultrastructural defects, specific for PCD. These results validate the suitability of the clinical use of the saccharin test as a screening procedure for NMCC. The false-negative results obtained in three cases of PCD, all with borderline values, cannot be ascribed to ineffectiveness of the test, but rather to the persistence of some motility by certain defective cilia, detectable by microphoto-oscillographic investigation of specimens obtained by nasal biopsy or brushing...|$|E

High levels of different poly-ols, including glycerol, inhibited growth of the gpd 1 gpd 2 mutant. This growth inhibition was suppressed by expression of the hyperactive allele Fps 1 - 1 of the osmogated yeast aquaglyceroporin, Fps 1.

In the present study, we describe the experimental station for monitoring water and sediment fluxes built in 1985 on the Rio Cordon, a small step-pool channel in the eastern Italian Alps.

Results from a combined frequency analysis of peak water discharge and total bed-load volumes are presented. In addition, the integration between the sediment transport dataset and the repeated surveys of sediment sources and of channel changes allowed us to assess the geomorphological effectiveness of different flood events. Despite the importance of the experimental station for making these bed-load observations possible, its maintenance costs are not low and these may have an impact on its future existence. At the same time, improving current instrumentation and future installations with novel technology would make the station an ideal location for calibrating surrogate techniques for sediment transport monitoring...|$|E

It is formed mainly of Nummulite rich facies of the Jdeir Formation deposited during the Eocene epoch (Late Ypresian age) in the giant El-Bouri oil field-Sabratah Basin-NW Libya. Deposits of the Jdeir Formation directly overlay the Jirani dolomite and Bilal Formation, and unconformably underlay the Tellil Group and Ghallil Formation. ^ Nummulite accumulations are good indicators for hydrocarbon studies {{and they have}} been targets for numerous studies around the world. Nummulite 2 ̆ 2 Large foraminifera 2 ̆ 2 tests are usually identified by two forms: A-form and B-form. Previous studies have highlighted many different aspects of foraminifers including taxonomy, test structure, <b>test</b> <b>transport,</b> abrasion, biofabric, climate, and ecological studies, and test morphology. However, previous studies have not studied in detail the distribution of A-form and B-form. This present study aims to use A/B Ratio distributions within facies and relate that to two aspects; depositional environments and physical processes. The present study will use a Minas 2 ̆ 7 s chart which summaries the relationship between A/B ratio, depositional environment, and physical processes. In addition, classification of death assemblages will be evaluated to distinguish the physical processes. ^ This could provide insight into the vertical and lateral distribution of porosity and permeability, as well as understanding the relationships between Nummulite biofabrics and the physical processes.

In the present work, {{we describe the}} experimental station for monitoring water and sediment fluxes built in 1985 on the Rio Cordon (Eastern Italian Alps), a small step-pool channel. The measuring station consists of an inclined frame that separates (at 20 mm truncation) fine and coarse sediments, which are continuously measured for accumulations by two turbidimeters. The 25 -year dataset acquired, which comprises high-magnitude/low-recurrence flood events, has allowed a magnitude-frequency analysis of bedload volumes. Results from a combined frequency analysis of peak water discharge and total bedload volumes based on the 25 events are presented, focusing on discrepancies between recurrence intervals of peak discharge and bedload volume for each event. In addition, the integration between the sediment transport dataset and the repeated surveys of sediment sources and of channel changes has permitted to assess the geomorphic effectiveness of different flood events. The Rio Cordon measuring facilities have provided excellent data and valuable insights into the bedload dynamics of steep streams throughout its 25 years of operation, thanks to the close collaboration between the ARPAV-Veneto Region and the Department Land and Agro-forest Environments (University of Padova). However, the maintenance costs of the station are not trivial and may impact its future "vitality". At the same time, improvement of the present instrumentation and installation of novel technology would make the station an ideal location for calibrating surrogate techniques for sediment transport monitoring...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKEA genes encode {{putative}} K+ efflux antiporters {{that are}} predominantly found in algae and plants but are rare in metazoa; however, nothing {{is known about}} their functions in eukaryotic cells. Plant KEA proteins show homology to bacterial K+ efflux (Kef) transporters, though two members in the Arabidopsis thaliana family, AtKEA 1 and AtKEA 2, have acquired an extra hydrophilic domain of over 500 residues at the amino terminus. We show that AtKEA 2 is highly expressed in leaves, stems and flowers, but not in roots, and that an N-terminal peptide of the protein is targeted to chloroplasts in Arabidopsis cotyledons. The full-length AtKEA 2 protein was inactive when expressed in yeast; however, a truncated AtKEA 2 protein (AtsKEA 2) lacking the N-terminal domain complemented disruption of the Na+(K+) /H+ antiporter Nhx 1 p to confer hygromycin resistance and tolerance to Na+ or K+ stress. To <b>test</b> <b>transport</b> activity, purified truncated AtKEA 2 was reconstituted in proteoliposomes containing the fluorescent probe pyranine. Monovalent cations reduced an imposed pH gradient (acid inside) indicating AtsKEA 2 mediated cation/H+ exchange with preference for K+=Cs+>Li+>Na+. When a conserved Asp 721 in transmembrane helix 6 that aligns to the cation binding Asp 164 of Escherichia coli NhaA was replaced with Ala, AtsKEA 2 was completely inactivated. Mutation of a Glu 835 between transmembrane helix 8 and 9 in AtsKEA 2 also resulted in loss of activity suggesting this region has a regulatory role. Thus, AtKEA 2 represents the founding member of a novel group of eukaryote K+/H+ antiporters that modulate monovalent cation and pH homeostasis in plant chloroplasts or plastids...|$|E
40|$|In the {{analysis}} of high gradient mountain streams an important aspect {{is represented by the}} quantification of the bedload transport. Field data necessary to <b>test</b> <b>transport</b> models and better understand sediment transport phenomena result scarce and difficult to obtain. In the present study, we focus the attention on the results obtained by multiple field surveys carried out after the November 2012 event when bedload transport along the Rio Cordon, a small step-pool channel in the eastern Italian Alps, was generated. The stream is characterized by the presence of a station, managed by the Regional Land Safety Department of ARPAV (Regional Agency for Environmental Protection and Prevention of Veneto), for monitoring water and sediment fluxes since 1986. The measuring station consists of an inclined frame that separates fine from coarse sediments (D> 20 mm), which are continuously assessed by a series of ultrasonic sensors fitted above a storage area. After the November 2012 event, a series of field surveys were carried out to identify the source area of the mobilized sediment. The quantification of bedload and fine loads using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner device was then performed, allowing the definition of the volume and grain-size characteristics of the transported sediment. The results have shown that the main source area was represented by lateral small debris flow located just upstream the measuring station. Thanks to the grain-size characterization and the field recognition it was possible to confirm that no morphological changes of the main channel have occurred upstream the sediment sources immission. Therefore, the input of sediment for the stream derives only from lateral debris flow process located near to the catchment output...|$|E
