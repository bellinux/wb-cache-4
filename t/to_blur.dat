Fashion designers are now starting <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types of hastati, principes and triarii began <b>to</b> <b>blur,</b> perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment. By the time of Polybius, the triarii or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass, but the hastati and principes had become indistinguishable.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the fourteenth century, in {{addition}} to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.|$|E

5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, Scottish armies were still largely {{assembled}} {{on the basis}} of common service and feudal obligations, with the addition of troops maintained by money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent. Common service theoretically called all men between the ages of 16 and 60 for a maximum of 40 days in one year. Such troops were expected to serve at their own expense and to bring their own supplies, a factor that severely limited the ability of Scottish armies to take part in sustained campaigning. Feudalism had been introduced to Scotland in the twelfth century, meaning that knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis, particularly heavily armed noble cavalry. Bonds of manrent were similar to English indentures of the same period, used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. Scotland relied on these systems longer than was the case in England. In practice, forms of service tended <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> and overlap, and major Scottish lords continued to bring contingents from their kindred. In 1513 for the Flodden campaign these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but in the religious and politically divided mid-sixteenth century there is evidence that the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment.|$|E
5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin <b>to</b> <b>blur.</b> Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} how face-selective cortical areas process configural and componential face {{information and}} how race of faces may influence these processes. Participants saw blurred (preserving configural information), scrambled (preserving componential information), and whole faces during fMRI scan, and performed a post-scan face recognition task using blurred or scrambled faces. The fusiform face area (FFA) showed stronger activation <b>to</b> <b>blurred</b> than <b>to</b> scrambled faces, and equivalent responses <b>to</b> <b>blurred</b> and whole faces. The occipital face area (OFA) showed stronger activation to whole than <b>to</b> <b>blurred</b> faces, which elicited similar responses to scrambled faces. Therefore, the FFA {{may be more}} tuned to process configural than componential information, whereas the OFA similarly participates in perception of both. Differences in recognizing own- and other-race blurred faces were correlated with differences in FFA activation to those faces, suggesting that configural processing within the FFA may underlie the other-race effect in face recognition. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|A Gaussian blur {{effect is}} {{typically}} generated by convolving an image with a kernel of Gaussian values.

In the first pass, a one-dimensional kernel is used <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> the image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> in the remaining direction.

40|$|Visual odometry (VO) {{estimation}} from {{blurred image}} is a challenging problem in practical robot applications, and the blurred images will severely reduce the estimation accuracy of the VO. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} visual odometry estimation from blurred images, and present an adaptive visual odometry estimation framework robust <b>to</b> <b>blurred</b> images. Our approach employs an objective measure of images, named small image gradient distribution (SIGD), <b>to</b> evaluate the <b>blurring</b> degree of the image, then an adaptive blurred image classification algorithm is proposed <b>to</b> recognize the <b>blurred</b> images, finally we propose an anti-blurred key-frame selection algorithm to enable the VO robust <b>to</b> <b>blurred</b> images. We also carried out varied comparable experiments to evaluate the performance of the VO algorithms with our anti-blur framework under varied blurred images, and the experimental results show that our approach can achieve superior performance comparing to the state-of-the-art methods under the condition with blurred images while not increasing too much computation cost to the original VO algorithms...|$|R

30|$|For {{high density}} noise removal, the {{corrupted}} image {{will have a}} very less number of non-noisy pixels sparsely located. The anatomy of interpolation is to find a suitable value that is closer to original pixel, using the meager non-noisy available in a current processing window. If more number of non-noisy pixels is employed, then the impact of the pixel in restoring the original pixel diminishes, thereby leading <b>to</b> <b>blurring.</b> Hence, lesser number of pixels will have greater impact in the information preservation after removing the noise. If we have only two non-noisy pixels on either side of an edge, then interpolated value lies between the two values (which will lead <b>to</b> <b>blurring).</b> Hence, opting for two non-noisy pixels is not reliable for estimation. So a minimum of three non-noisy pixels for the calculation of weights in IDWI is chosen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new restoration approach <b>to</b> <b>blurred</b> images using inverse filters optimized by a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed approach {{consists of two}} procedures. The first is to estimate a degradation level of blurred images based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the next is to optimize inverse filters using a Real-coded GA. The degradation level estimation prior to inverse filters optimization enables the adaptive and efficient image restoration according <b>to</b> the <b>blurred</b> level. Experiments on natural images demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide a practical solution for a blind image restoration...|$|R
