500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy always looks to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because <b>that</b> by <b>which</b> another person has faith is not <b>that</b> by <b>which</b> he is different from him but is <b>that</b> by <b>which</b> he is like him; <b>that</b> by <b>which</b> he possesses it is not <b>that</b> by <b>which</b> he is different from others but <b>that</b> by <b>which</b> he is altogether like all." ...|$|R
40|$|The CNS {{needs to}} be {{understood}} at four nearly independent levels of description: (1) <b>that</b> at <b>which</b> the nature of computation is expressed; (2) <b>that</b> at <b>which</b> the algorithms <b>that</b> implement a computation are characterized; (3) <b>that</b> at <b>which</b> an algorithm is committed to particular mechanisms; and (4) <b>that</b> at <b>which</b> the mechanisms are realized in hardware. In general, {{the nature of a}} computation is determined by the problem to be solved, the mechanisms that are used depend upon the available hardware, and the particular algorithms chosen depend on the problem and on the available mechanisms. Examples are given of theories at each level...|$|R
5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than <b>that</b> <b>which</b> frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|A September 1999 {{report from}} Baird's {{ministry}} showed that 10,600 workfare placements {{had been created}} {{in the first six}} months of 1999, a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than <b>that</b> <b>which</b> had been predicted by the government.

5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory beyond <b>that</b> <b>which</b> had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to <b>that</b> <b>which</b> had occurred in Germany.|$|E

5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, {{it appears to be}} a leg break, but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to <b>that</b> <b>which</b> is expected, behaving as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E

5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to <b>that</b> <b>which</b> the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

40|$|The {{steady-state}} {{performance of}} flat-plate collectors, charged with phase-changing working fluids, {{has been studied}} analytically.

The results are then combined to express the collector efficiency {{as a function of the}} saturation temperature and liquid level. Numerical calculations of the collector efficiencies were carried out for double-glazed flat-plate collectors employing R- 11 as the working fluid. ...|$|R

5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For <b>that</b> <b>which</b> has not efficient causes is neither true nor false.

And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
