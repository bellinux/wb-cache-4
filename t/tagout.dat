50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and <b>tagout</b> procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (earthing) clamps and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the risk(s) associated with lockout/tagout of hazardous energy and propose a new LOTO procedure which tracks the implementation of LOTO to mitigate against identified risks as a basis for promotion of safety. The study focuses on electrical personnel working in PHCN. Only electrical accident risks are examined, not other types of risk e. g. mechanical, chemical, and nuclear. To gather material for this study, a questionnaire was distributed amongst electrical workers in PHCN and their supervisors were interviewed. Relevant literature and publications were studied as reference. According to electrical personnel experience, electrocution, arc flash, arc blast, burns and lockout and <b>tagout</b> of the wrong electrical circuit are seen as the biggest electrical safety risk with regards to LOTO of hazardous energy. The research reveals new information about electrical accident risks. This information is used to create a procedure for tracking LOTO of hazardous energy. The procedure can be utilized in the mitigation of electrical risks and promotion ofMaster...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedElectrical shock mishaps account for 33 {{percent of all}} personnel injuries occurring onboard U. S. Navy surface combatants from 1995 to 1997. Clearly this indicates a need to identify the root causes and to develop intervention strategies for preventing electrical shock. Electrical shock root causal factors are identified through the evaluation of Special Case Mishap Reports maintained by the Naval Safety Center. Analysis indicates that over 85 percent of electrical shock mishaps are human factors related. Scenario analysis coupled with categorical data analysis is used to identify human factors patterns that are present in electrical shock mishaps. This human factors approach finds that the failure of two primary human factors related interventions identified in the safety literature, improper <b>tagout</b> of equipment and misuse of personal protective equipment, account for 37 percent of the mishaps. A stochastic model of electrical shock mishaps, including human factors related and non-human factors related mishaps, is constructed to develop an overall impression of the status quo. This model is then used to forecast the impact of correcting the identified failed interventions on future expected mishap frequencies and associated costs[URL] United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|Electrical arcing {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common form of electrical injury in mining. MSHA data show that 381 "non-contact electric arc burn" injuries occurred in the mining industry from 1996 - 2005. A more detailed study of data from 1990 - 2001 showed that five types of apparatus - circuit breakers, conductors, nonpowered hand tools, electrical meters and test leads, and connectors and plugs were involved in two-thirds of the lost workday injuries. Many of the protections from electrical arcing injury available to workers in other industries stem from the application of National Fire Protection Association Standard 70 E - Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace (NFPA 70 E). NFPA 70 E is a generally accepted industry guideline document, but excludes underground mining from its scope. Many of its practices and procedures, however, can be applied in the mining workplace to supplement the existing electrical safety requirements of Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations. This paper describes how NFPA 70 E can be applied to mining workplaces after an analysis of the mine power system electrical arcing hazards has been completed (and Hazard/Risk Categories determined) using the tables from NFPA 70 E or the calculation method as described in IEEE 1584. NFPA 70 E can then be used to determine the levels and types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect miners against burn injuries. Appropriate lockout and <b>tagout</b> (LOTO) procedures for use in the mining industry are also described. Suggestions for better selection of electrically-rated hand tools are included. Recommendations for electrical meter selection and use based on transient withstand capability are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{preliminary}} safety study of electrified railroad systems, the Volpe Center has developed an initial outline of a model set of electrical operating instructions (safety work rules). These may act as suggested guidelines for newly emerging electrified railroads which may be operated by an organization not having any previous experience in electrified operations. The proposed outline is based " upon the review of industry standards, available railroad electrical' instructions ' and safety rules, government regulations, relevant standards. numerous operating and other The main parts of a recommended model set of electrical operating instructions (safety rules) would include as a minimum: • approach distances • hot line work procedures • <b>tagout</b> and lockout procedures • protection duties • grounding procedures • use of personal protective equipment • work in confined and enclosed spaces • precautions for the oper~tion of MOW and construction vehicles (including wire trains, etc.) • work in elevated places and on platforms • emergency first aid/rescue procedures. A summary of the model work rules development has been developed and attached. At this time, draft text sections have been completed for all the above subjects, except for: 1) work on energized lines, 2) work on MOW and construction vehicles, 3) emergency first aid rescue procedures. These completed sections are attached. As mentioned in our previous progress report (attached), dated January 3, 1996, comprehensive reviews of existing standards, regulations and available railroad instructions have been completed.
