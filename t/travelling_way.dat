40|$|The term 'Romany' {{immediately}} {{conjures up}} notions {{of race and}} ethnicity, accompanied by images of a separate and distinct culture. Many writers, past and present, have contributed to this essentially mythical, racial construct. Although nineteenth-century travellers were varied {{in terms of their}} habits, aspirations, wealth, type of dwelling and the like, the attempt to draw between the travellers’ cultural lines of divide based on racial determinants contains serious flaws in assumptions, methodology and evidence. f, I- I Moreover, although varied, the travellers were bound together by certain common features, notably by their position as a minority group in relation to settled society. Resultant upon their <b>travelling</b> <b>way</b> of life was a conflict with the 'centre', or with the institutions and structures of a sedentary-based society, in this instance organised around a capitalist political economy. The nature of this relationship with the dominant economic, social and political structures can be explained summarily by reference to the attempts to christianise, educate,, settle and sanitise the travellers, and which were carried 'out with various degrees of coercion and compulsion. Formal and informal upholders and agents of the 'new morality' worked together to bring about these desired ends. The position of travellers was also necessarily affected by general trends taking place within the economy and society as a whole. Changed perceptions about them, responses to them, and the conditions under which they lived, were a reflection of more general developments, economic trends affected their employments, and where they were carried out, which in turn altered their relations with the sedentary community they served. Similarly, racial theories concerning the 'Romany' assumed a position of pre-eminent status only with the related growth of, and deference to, scientific knowledge from the mid-century onwards...|$|E

40|$|In {{many cities}} of {{developing}} countries, buses are {{the backbone of}} public transport. However, {{most of them are}} operating in mixed traffic conditions without priority measures and with a number of problems at bus stops, on <b>travel</b> <b>ways,</b> and at traffic signals. Illustrative examples for this situation are motorcycle dependent cities (MDCs) such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. A lack of bus prioritisation for many years {{is one of the main}} causes leading to the poor quality of bus services and the rapid growth of individual motorised traffic in these cities. Consequently, MDCs are facing critical transport problems in terms of traffic accidents, environmental pollution, traffic congestion, and economic loss. To solve that problematic situation, this study presents an integrated approach for prioritising buses in MDCs. The important role of bus services and the necessity of bus prioritisation were justified at first. Then the principle approaches of bus prioritisation were consolidated based on the experience of developed countries. As a subsequent part, existing problems for buses at bus stops, on <b>travel</b> <b>ways,</b> and at traffic signals were determined, and the concept of bus prioritisation was introduced to MDCs. Thereafter, corresponding measures were developed and formulated to solve the mentioned problems. The fundamental effect of the most potential measures was estimated, based on the principles of traffic engineering. To identify the level of effects of promising measures, sensitivity analyses were conducted. The location of on-line bus stops in mixed traffic conditions was identified to have noticeable influences on traffic flow quality of both buses and other vehicles as well as on capacities of intersection approaches involved. For this reason, a significant amount of vehicular delays can be saved and a considerable amount of capacity can be added if the bus stop location is properly selected. This study identified that the impact of a bus stop on capacity and traffic flow quality varies at different positions of the stop, and it is critical within certain ranges close to traffic signals. Outside those ranges, the impact reduces to modest or insignificant levels. Thereby, the determination of those ranges contributes to select a proper bus stop position with respect to the requirements of capacity and traffic flow quality at traffic signals. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, a position of bus stops with a distance further than 60 metres from the stop line (for near-side stops) or from the beginning of the downstream intersection (for far-side stops) is recommended for general traffic situation in MDCs. Regarding priority measures for bus <b>travel</b> <b>ways,</b> it is concluded that most of the existing measures such as exclusive bus lanes, bus lanes shared with other modes, and queue jump lanes will be hardly applied to current roadways of MDCs if supportive measures (e. g. traffic rerouting and infrastructure measures) are not given. Thereby, a provision of additional options which enable to prioritise buses on their <b>travel</b> <b>ways</b> will be significant for these cities. From the practical essentials, this study developed two new measures including discontinuous bus lanes and partial dynamic bus lanes. On the one hand, these bus lanes will result in positive effects for buses; on the other hand, their side effects on general traffic will be kept at permissible levels. The sensitivity analysis indicated that these lanes provided the following advantages under heavily loaded traffic conditions: • About 40...|$|R
