From 192122 until 195758, the Third Division South operated as the third highest level of English football, running in parallel with the Third Division North. From 195859 until 199192, Division 1 was <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> English football, Division 2 the second highest, Division 3 the third highest and Division 4 the fourth highest.
