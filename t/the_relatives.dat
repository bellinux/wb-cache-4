40|$|This article investigates two {{strategies}} of relative clause formation in Zulu, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa. The standard way of forming a relative clause in Zulu involves a prefix (a so-called 'relative concord') which {{is attached to}} the predicate of <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> clause. In this strategy, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> concord expresses agreement with the subject of <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> clause. In a second strategy, <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> concord seems to be prefixed to the first word of <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> clause; in this position, it agrees with the head noun. The main claim of this article is that the second strategy of relative clause formation in Zulu is an example of phrasal affixation. I show that <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> concord does not merge morphologically with the first word of <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> clause, but is attached to <b>the</b> whole <b>relative</b> clause. Following Anderson (1992), I analyse this kind of phrasal affixation as an inflectional process; <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> clause is a predicate, and <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> concord in <b>the</b> second strategy expresses agreement between this phrasal predicate and the head noun...|$|R

5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes.

They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano {{borrowed}} {{heavily from}} the commedia dell'arte tradition in Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself recalls the roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone {{is drawn from}} Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet Zany. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily scares <b>the</b> <b>relatives,</b> and his captain, are stock characters from commedia dell'arte.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches.

Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E

5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> {{did not have}} a right to {{occupational}} injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees {{did not have a}} right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E

In June 1166 Becket excommunicated de Broc for his part in administering the archiepiscopal estates for the king while Becket was in exile.

5|$|Many crash {{survivors}} suffered long recoveries {{from the}} physical and psychological traumas they endured. A month after the crash, an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest {{the handling of the}} flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing the agency of failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200million in damages to the victims.|$|E

5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard.

Beginning with the purchase and resale of a few bars of soap, the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E
