I was caught out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> hear it first. That's how it should be.

500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn". Even though [...] "Burn" [...] {{was just what}} the label was looking for, they believed that [...] "Yeah!" [...] would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>you</b> want an event." ...|$|E

500|$|Two similar {{versions}} of the video were released. In one, clips from Pokémon: The First Movie are played on the screen at the drive in theatre. In the other version, fewer images of the screen are shown; when they are seen the Pokémon images are replaced with either clips of Raven and Larsen singing the song or words such as [...] "M2M" [...] and [...] "Intermission". The Pokémon version of the video uses the censored lyrics, while the other one uses the album version of the song. The Pokémon version was included on the DVD of the film, while the other version was included on the bonus disc in <b>The</b> <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Went Away: The Best of M2M.|$|E

Art started playing trumpet professionally {{at the age}} of 16, {{performing}} in the bands of Horace Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, and Floyd Ray, among others. These opportunities came about through a combination of his ability and the absence of numerous older musicians, who were still in the armed forces following World War II. Around this time in Los Angeles, there were abundant opportunities for musical development, according to Farmer: [...] "During <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> would go to somebody's house and play. At night there were after-hours clubs [...] anybody who wanted to play was free to come up and play". Farmer left high school early but persuaded the principal to give him a diploma, which he did not collect until a visit to the school in 1958.|$|E

500|$|Arm's lyrics, {{according}} to critic Steve Huey, are a rant about [...] "disease, self-loathing, angst, and dirty sex". In an essay called [...] "'Touch Me I'm Sick': Contagion as Critique in Punk and Performance Art", Catherine J. Creswell {{suggests that some}} of the lyrics refer to AIDS. According to Creswell, [...] "In declaring 'Well, I'm diseased and I don't mind' and changing the final refrain to 'Fuck Me, I'm Sick!' the speaker declares himself to be the viral, 'AIDS-bearing,' 'polluting' person of contemporary fantasy". Creswell, who also believes the song parodies the theme of seduction in contemporary rock music, points to lyrics that refer to impotence ("If you don't come, if you don't come, if you don't come, you'll die alone!") and violent possession or forcing ("I'll make you love me till <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> die!"). However, Arm says that he had not put much thought into the lyrics; while performing the song in concerts, he sometimes changes them to amuse himself.|$|E
500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>you</b> have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] is a {{complimentary}} love song that contains [...] "curse" [...] words and a repetitive chorus. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song has a simple message evident in the lyrics, [...] "At the end of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> are {{who you are and}} I love you that way." [...] Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a [...] "serene song". [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] contains the line [...] "And you my lover / But I love you like a brother" [...] which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as [...] "hollow" [...] declaration that she is never going away. While singing the lines [...] "Middle of the Day / Give Me What I want / It feels so special / It feels so good" [...] she admits [...] "liking afternoon delights".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{is portrayed as}} having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game [...] bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] and often gives the farewell, [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> will always remember as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" [...] which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, [...] "But you have heard of me." [...] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being [...] "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns {{it can be a}} terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being [...] "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," [...] as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.|$|E
500|$|Though [...] "Yeah!" [...] was now completed, {{the label}} still had [...] "Burn" [...] on queue {{for the lead}} single. Usher's friend and former A rep Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather commented: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>you</b> want an event." [...] Usher was unsure if [...] "Yeah!" [...] was the right choice. After Lil Jon leaked [...] "Yeah!" [...] to street DJs across the United States, Usher opted [...] "Burn" [...] as the lead single of the album and was already {{planning}} for its music video. The song {{was not intended to}} be a proper single and only a teaser for Usher's fans after waiting for years. However, the responses of [...] "Yeah!" [...] were overwhelmingly favorable, and [...] "Yeah!" [...] was released as the first single instead of [...] "Burn", which became the second single from the album. The single was released in the United States on January 27, 2004 as a CD single and 12" [...] single. LaFace Records sent [...] "Yeah!" [...] to US contemporary hit radio on February 7, 2004. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a CD single, containing the album and instrumental version of the song, and two unreleased tracks from the album, [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Sweet Lies".|$|E
500|$|Milian's {{first major}} acting role was {{offered by the}} Disney Channel to join The Mickey Mouse Club; however, she did not accept and opted to star as a {{reporter}} on Movie Surfers. During this time, she had minor roles in film and television, including Sister, Sister, Smart Guy, The Steve Harvey Show, Get Real, The Wood and American Pie. In 2002, Milian was appointed {{the host of the}} live competitive music series Becoming Presents: Wannabe on MTV, where she met director Joseph Kahn. Kahn suggested she audition for a lead role in the film Torque. Her audition was successful and she played a minor role in the film. She was subsequently cast in her first lead role in Love Don't Cost a Thing. Milian {{has been described as a}} role model to young girls; she has said that there are a lot of people who young girls look up to, but [...] "at the end of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> have to be your own person and love yourself." [...] Milian worked with the Children Uniting Nations charity, in which she was a big sister to foster children, and says her favorite charity is the Penny Lane Foundation. Milian was awarded with a humanitarian award at The Reign fundraiser from the Elton John AIDS Foundation for being a role model for young children. Milian said, [...] "I've never been rewarded that way and never been acknowledged like that. That was really nice of them, and I was happy I was able to show up for the kids." ...|$|E

500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. <b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} lyrics to Lightning Bolt, Vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his {{feelings}} compared to the [...] "word games" [...] of previous Pearl Jam albums. The songs discuss lasting relationships, bad faith ("Getaway," [...] "Mind Your Manners"), {{the state of the}} world ("Infallible") and life's transience ("Pendulum"), which Vedder summed up as [...] "the same mysteries that I’ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now." [...] Gossard explained that the reflective tone was indicative of the bandmembers' age: [...] " [...] 40-something, almost 50-something, you're looking at life through your kids' eyes, through the filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long, through the filter of your parents getting older and the passing of friends and relatives-relationships and all that they encompass, the difficulties of them and the sacrifices you make in them and also the joy they bring you." [...] Vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality, but relented given he felt that [...] "death is everywhere" [...] and writing about death would help [...] "getting through it", as [...] "living to <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> die, and being cognizant of the end, you might lead a more appreciative life". One of the compositions about the theme was [...] "Future Days", which discusses the loss of Vedder's friend Dennis Flemion, who accidentally drowned in 2012. The concernment in the songs also owed to Vedder being a father, as the singer detailed that [...] "It’s going to be their world and what is their future? It feels like there is a lot that can be lost in the next 50 years if people don’t pay attention." ...|$|E
