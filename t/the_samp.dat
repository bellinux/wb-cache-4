30|$|To {{extend the}} {{application}} of the CS theory to large-scale image signal processes, we focus on improving the reconstruction efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> algorithm. In <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> algorithm, a high reconstruction accuracy is obtained by using a small initial step-size. Unfortunately, this setting causes <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> algorithm to run massive iteration in order to adjust the number of selected atoms for the adaptive approximation of signal sparsity. Therefore we propose a fast sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (FSAMP) algorithm where the number of selected atoms is changed from an original linear to a nonlinear growth form. In the FSAMP algorithm, the initial step-size is set at a large value, and the step-size gradually shrinks in each iteration until the number of selected atoms is precisely approximate to the signal sparsity. This method decreases the number of iterations and shortens reconstruction time. Meanwhile, to lower the impact on reconstruction accuracy because of the changes in atom selection method of FSAMP algorithm, we introduce a reselection strategy which prunes the selected atoms to ensure reconstruction accuracy.|$|E

Our results were derived from differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of SAMP 8 mice compared to age-matched SAMR 1 mice at 2, 6, and 12 months of age using cDNA microarray analysis.

40|$|Background/Aims: Chronic {{stress can}} lead to {{cognitive}} impairment. Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP 8) is a naturally occurring animal model that is useful for investigating the neurological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. Here we investigated the impact and mechanisms of chronic stress on cognition in male SAMP 8 mice. Methods: Male 6 -month- old SAMP 8 and SAMR 1 (senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1) mice strains were randomly divided into 4 groups. Mice in the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) groups were exposed to diverse stressors for 4 weeks. Then, these mice performed Morris water maze (MWM) test to assess the effect of UCMS on learning and memory. To explore the neurological mechanisms of UCMS on cognition in mice, we evaluated changes in the expression of postsynaptic density 95 (PSD 95) and synaptophysin (SYN), which are essential proteins for synaptic plasticity. Five mice from each group were randomly chosen for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting analysis of SYN and PSD 95. Results: The Morris water maze experiment revealed that the cognitive ability of <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> 8 mice decreased with brain aging, and that chronic stress aggravated this cognitive deficit. In addition, chronic stress decreased the mRNA and protein expression of SYN and PSD 95 in the hippocampus of <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> 8 mice; however, the SAMR 1 mice were unaffected. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that decreased cognition and synaptic plasticity are related to aging. Moreover, we show that chronic stress aggravated this cognitive deficit and decreased SYN and PSD 95 expression in <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> 8 mice. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> 8 mice were more vulnerable to the detrimental effects of chronic stress on cognition than the SAMR 1 mice. Our {{results suggest that the}} neurological mechanisms of chronic stress on cognition might be associated with a decrease in hippocampal SYN and PSD 95 expression, which is critical for structural synaptic plasticity...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Metallothionein 3 (MT- 3) {{has been}} shown to protect against {{apoptotic}} neuronal death in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Zinc is a potent inhibitor of caspase- 3 and its deficiency was found to promote apoptosis. Here, we measured the zinc and copper content in the brains of senescence-accelerated mouse/PRONE 8 (SAMP 8) and sought to investigate the effect of MT- 3 on the apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampal CA 1 region of these mice. METHOD: The zinc and copper content in the brain samples of SAMP 8 and normal control SAMR 1 mice were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The mice were administered intraperitoneally for four weeks with MT- 3 or MT 1 and thereafter apoptosis was measured using the TUNEL method and the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 and proapoptotic protein Bax was examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with that in SMAR 1 mice, the content of zinc in <b>the</b> brains of <b>SAMP</b> 8 mice was significantly reduced (P< 0. 05). Moreover, significant levels of apoptosis of neurons were observed in <b>the</b> hippocampus of <b>SAMP</b> 8 mice, which, compared with those in SMAR 1 mice, also showed significantly lower levels of Bcl- 2 and higher levels of Bax (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a truncated base excision repair pathway in human spermatozoa mediated by OGG 1 has raised questions regarding the effect of mutations in critical DNA repair genes on {{the integrity of the}} paternal genome. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP 8) is a mouse model containing a suite of naturally occurring mutations resulting in an accelerated senescence phenotype largely mediated by oxidative stress, which is further enhanced by a mutation in the Ogg 1 gene, greatly reducing the ability of the enzyme to excise 8 -hydroxy, 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) adducts. An analysis of the reproductive phenotype of <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> 8 males revealed a high level of DNA damage in caudal epididymal spermatozoa as measured by the alkaline Comet assay. Furthermore, these lesions were confirmed to be oxidative in nature, as demonstrated by significant increases in 8 OHdG adduct formation in <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> 8 testicular tissue (P< 0. 05) as well as in mature spermatozoa (P< 0. 001) relative to a control strain (SAMR 1).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel iterative greedy reconstruction algorithm for practical compressed sensing (CS), called the sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP). Compared with other state-of-the-art greedy algorithms, {{the most innovative}} feature of <b>the</b> <b>SAMP</b> is its capability of signal reconstruction without prior information of the sparsity. This makes it a promising candidate for many practical applications {{when the number of}} non-zero (significant) coefficients of a signal is not available. The proposed algorithm adopts a sim-ilar flavor of the EM algorithm, which alternatively estimates the sparsity and the true support set of the target signals. In fact, SAMP provides a generalized greedy reconstruction framework in which the orthogonal matching pursuit and the subspace pursuit can be viewed as its special cases. Such a connection also gives us an in-tuitive justification of trade-offs between computational complexity and reconstruction performance.
