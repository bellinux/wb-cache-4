5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> {{of the new}} air force, the {{backbone}} of which was provided by 500 former VVKJ officers and 1,600 NCOs, was the acquisition or salvage of aircraft, weapons, machinery, equipment and fuel that had survived the fighting and had not been confiscated by the German or Italian forces.|$|E
5|$|There {{were further}} deportations from the capital. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> was to {{identify}} those imprisoned. They were held for one day in a police station (Ottoman Turkish: Emniyeti Umumiye) and the Central Prison. A second wave brought the figure to between 500 and 600.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of remedial and preparatory works such as land acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and remedial works on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was spent by Network Rail. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle Viaduct (or Lothianbridge Viaduct) was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E

5|$|Each has {{the same}} basic {{sequence}} of events: The camera zooms through cumulus clouds, through the show's title towards the town of Springfield. The camera then follows {{the members of the}} family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by David Silverman, and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> he did when production began on the show. The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 9, the IAF {{aircraft}} over Lebanon were operating at three levels. Kfirs and Skyhawks were along the coastline from Sidon {{to the outskirts of}} Beirut, providing close air support for the ground troops and striking at Palestine Liberation Organization targets. At the second level, over 10,000 feet (3,000 m), similar formations were circling and awaiting orders. At the top level, Hawkeyes were stationed to ensure air control. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> force aircraft attacked the Syrian radar at the top of Jebel Baruk, which was commanding a large area.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> is {{to polish}} Howard's belt buckles. Howard tends to stand {{too close to}} the urinal and urine often {{splashes}} back onto the buckles. Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him.|$|E

50|$|These demands {{were not}} easy for the {{imperial}} court to accept, however, its weak position provided little choice. One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>tasks</b> of <b>the</b> Diet was abolishing serfdom, which was announced on March 18, 1848.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> which Qutayba {{set himself}} was the {{suppression}} of the rebellion in Lower Tokharistan, which was accomplished swiftly with the reconquest of Balkh. Qutayba then secured the submission of the local princes in the upper Oxus valley, most notably of Tish, king of al-Saghaniyan, who invited Qutayba to aid him in his dispute with the ruler of nearby Akharun (or Akhrun) and Shuman, in the northern mountainous districts of Tokharistan. After extensive negotiations led by Sulaym the Persian, the tarkhan Nizak, ruler of the Hephthalite principality of Badghis, surrendered to Qutayba, and pledged to accompany him in his expeditions.|$|E
5|$|According to Congressman Jim Himes' website, the {{demolition}} funding was appropriated in 2009 {{and consisted of}} more than $2 million through federal funding. The money was funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Comprehensive Appropriations Act of 2009, and a Community Development Block Grant. According to the Connecticut Post, the State of Connecticut funded $1.2 million for {{the demolition}} of the bridge, and {{the first phase of}} the project was expected to cost $500,000. The contract for the demolition of the bridge was given to S Corporation and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> was to remove the eastern portion of the bridge. The entire process was expected to take six weeks to demolish the bridge. It was estimated that another $450,000 would be needed to remove the bridge's concrete counter-weights and $8 million to remove the approaches. In 2010, the Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Pequonnock River, Bridgeport, CT struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>tasks</b> facing <b>the</b> USAF, however, were {{to set up}} a {{workable}} organizational structure in the region, improve the area's inadequate air bases, create an efficient airlift system, and develop equipment and techniques to support the ground battle.|$|R
30|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>tasks</b> {{undertaken}} by our group was {{the construction of}} an analog network simulator with which the behavior of a complex electric power network could be simulated. The simulator is shown in Appendix A Fig. A 1.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>tasks</b> of <b>the</b> Assembly was {{to elect}} the President of Castilla-La Mancha from among their number, with the PP {{candidate}} Maria Dolores de Cospedal replacing the outgoing President, José María Barreda, incumbent since April 2004.|$|R
5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in August 1914, the {{squadron}} {{was assigned to the}} newly reconstituted Channel Fleet on 7 November and based at Portland, from which it patrolled the English Channel. Prince of Wales was now the flagship of Rear-Admiral Bernard Currey and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>task</b> of the squadron was to protect the transfer of the British Expeditionary Force over the English Channel to France. They patrolled the eastern end of the Channel while the 7th and 8th Battle Squadrons covered the cruiser squadron at the western entrance. The Germans made no significant effort to interfere with the traffic in the Channel and the 5th BS was allowed to return to Portland after the bulk of the BEF was across on 23 August. Several days later, the squadron ferried the Portsmouth Marine Battalion to Ostend, Belgium. On 14 November, the squadron transferred to Sheerness to guard against a possible German invasion of the United Kingdom, but it transferred back to Portland on 30 December 1914.|$|E

25|$|Motivated by {{economic}} uncertainties, Fleischer joined the Norwegian Military Academy and graduated {{as the second}} best student in 1905.
