When Glover's friend learned he had cancer he fought hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> <b>it,</b> but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later. This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide—which Lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal.|$|E
