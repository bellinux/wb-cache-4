5000|$|Furthermore, {{an object}} {{with a higher}} density than the bed will sink, whereas an object with a lower density than the bed will float, thus the <b>bed</b> <b>can</b> be {{considered}} to exhibit the fluid behavior expected of Archimedes' principle. As the [...] "density", (actually the solid volume fraction of the suspension), of the <b>bed</b> <b>can</b> be altered by changing the fluid fraction, objects with different densities comparative to the <b>bed</b> <b>can,</b> by altering either the fluid or solid fraction, be caused to sink or float.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} with a farm mother scolding Jack for trading his cow for three {{seemingly}} worthless beans. The beans are thrown out a window and land under Sylvester's <b>cat</b> <b>bed</b> while the lazy cat is taking a [...] "catnap". Instantly, the beans sprout into a giant beanstalk that reaches into the heavens, taking the still sleeping Sylvester with it. The puddy tat awakens and is startled at how everything seemingly grew overnight. Eventually, he walks inside a castle and instantly spots a giant birdcage (with a giant Tweety singing inside).|$|R
5000|$|Whilst Karren commended David in the {{boardroom}} on his enthusiasm in selling, noting {{that it had been}} contributory factor to Versatile's victory, she criticised him for focusing on the balloons, as it was pointed out that the T-shirts higher sale price would have brought in more money. Similarly, Charleine was critical of Richard for choosing the dog sofas, but he defended his choice by stating that the figures quoted by the vendor were more realistic to work with, than the ones from the vendor of the <b>cat</b> <b>beds</b> which he deemed misleading.|$|R

50|$|Caliche <b>beds</b> <b>can</b> cause {{problems}} for agriculture. First, an impermeable caliche layer prevents water from draining properly, which can keep roots from getting enough oxygen. Salts can also {{build up in}} the soil {{due to the lack}} of drainage. Both of these situations are detrimental to plant growth. Second, the impermeable nature of caliche beds prevents plant roots from penetrating the bed, which limits the supply of nutrients, water, and space so they cannot develop normally. Third, caliche <b>beds</b> <b>can</b> also cause the surrounding soil to be basic. The basic soil, along with calcium carbonate from the caliche, can prevent plants from getting enough nutrients, especially iron. An iron deficiency makes the youngest leaves turn yellow. Soil saturation above the caliche <b>bed</b> <b>can</b> make the condition worse.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, many parties have become {{interested}} in Hydrogen Peroxide for monopropellant applications. This has increasing lead {{to the need to}} decrease the mass of the catalyst bed. Hence this has led to a desire to drive the catalyst beds to higher mass fluxes than the prior state of the art. This paper examines an effort which methodically increased the flux level to more than three times that of the prior state of the art in the 1950 - 1970 s. Test data showing catalyst <b>bed</b> performance (<b>Cat</b> <b>bed</b> pressure drop, decomposition efficiency and roughness) versus flux are provided for design purposes...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a fluidized bed of hard spheres during defluidization displays properties associated with {{formation of a}} glass. The final state is rate dependent, and as this state is approached, the bed exhibits heterogeneity with increasing time and length scales. The formation of a glass results {{in the loss of}} fluidization and an arrest of macroscopic particle motion. Microscopic motion persists in this state, but the <b>bed</b> <b>can</b> be jammed by application of a small increase in flow rate. Thus a fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>can</b> serve as a test system for studies of glass formation and jamming. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PRL Replacement: modified figures and tex...|$|R
