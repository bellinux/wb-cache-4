5|$|Delegates, as <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{committees}} {{to complete their}} work, {{spent much of the}} first two days listening to various orators. Of these, only Senator Blackburn, a silver supporter, sparked much reaction, and that only momentary. Delegates called for better-known speakers, such as Altgeld or Bryan, but were granted neither then; the Illinois governor declined, and the Nebraskan, once seated, spent much of his time away from the convention floor at the platform committee meeting at the Palmer House.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis as <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} {{in the cold}} water before she found an air pocket {{and was able to}} remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E
5|$|The Peninsular War was not {{developing}} favourably for Spain, and by May 1810 a ship {{arrived with}} {{the news of the}} defeat of Seville and the disbanding of the Junta of Seville. Without either a recognised Spanish king or the Junta that had appointed Cisneros, many people thought that the viceroy no longer had any authority. Cisneros tried to conceal the news by gathering all the newspapers brought by the ship, but Belgrano and Castelli managed to get one. Cisneros then explained the European developments to the public. Belgrano {{and the members of the}} Carlotist party, despite having given up their original idea, plotted to remove the viceroy and replace him with a junta. Under the advice of Cornelio Saavedra, <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> news of the defeat in Spain to take action.|$|E
5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform. Meanwhile, the Credentials Committee voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers, {{as well as a}} delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese bombed Bangkok {{with one}} bomb {{falling on the}} main post office, which failed to explode. While police rounded up Japanese residents, the Thai cabinet debated its options while <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prime {{minister}} to arrive.

25|$|At {{seven in}} the morning the Kandyans appeared, {{covering}} the slopes that lined the Danture tract. <b>They</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese to come within range, then opened fire with muskets, gingals and arrows. The brunt of the attack fell on the advance guard; its commander, D. Gastão Coutinho, and several captains including Simão Pereira and Francisco de Brito were killed. This attack slowed the retreat, and the columns came to a halt. The forest concealed the Kandyans, who were able to cause casualties while remaining largely unseen. So the Portuguese decided to charge the enemy in front of them, in order to clear a path.|$|E
25|$|On {{the central}} front, IV Corps {{advanced}} into Burma, before indications {{that a major}} Japanese offensive was building caused it to retreat on Kohima and Imphal. Forward elements of the corps were nearly cut off by Japanese forces, but eventually {{made it back to}} India. As <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> storm to break, the British forces were not to know that the successful defence of the two cities would be the turning point of the entire campaign in south East Asia.

25|$|On February 19, {{the protesters}} from Ayeyarwaddy Region stalled their march {{and set up}} {{temporary}} camps in Maubin and Pathein Townships as <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decision from the parliament while giving public talks on the latest updates on the agreements they had {{with the government and}} the content of the proposed amendment bill. That day, Union Nationalities Alliance announced that they were in support of the student protests and donated $1000 {{while at the same time}} urging the parliament to quickly pass the amendments. Meanwhile, some 30 students from Dagon University in Yangon staged a sit-in in front of the rector’s office from 9:30 am to noon after they were unknowing invited to a campus event earlier that week that condemned the student protests. The sit-in was also a response to the article featured in The Mirror, a state-owned newspaper that claimed that students had organized the event by themselves.|$|E
25|$|On the Bresle, German troops {{did little}} while <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> panzer {{divisions}} to envelop the southern {{flank of the}} IX Corps defence line. The 4th Border and 1st/5th Forester continued their attempts to expel the Germans from positions in the Haute forêt d'Eu but only managed to prevent the Germans from taking more ground and there was skirmishing around Beauchamps. At dawn, the German panzer divisions resumed their attack towards Rouen. By this time the 51st (Highland) Division and the reinforcement of A Brigade from the Beauman Division was holding {{the line of the}} Bresle from Gamaches to Eu under the command of the divisional headquarters. The 1st Armoured Division had been broken up as soon as it arrived in France and without the detachments to Calais had taken part in the Allied offensive against the German bridgeheads south of the Somme. Since then, a Composite Regiment from the 2nd Armoured Brigade had remained with the 51st (Highland) Division and was covering the Haute forêt d'Eu. The rest of the 2nd and 3rd Armoured brigades had been reduced by losses to improvised units and held part of the Andelle line from Nolleval to Serqueux and the remnants of the Support Group was in the Basse forêt d'Eu under the command of the 51st (Highland) Division. B and C brigades of the Beauman Division were defending the Béthune–Andelle line from the Seine to Dieppe.|$|E

This allowed the fine-tuning of the testing instrumentation. The first two tubes arrived at Los Alamos on 10 March 1944, and test firing began at the Anchor Ranch {{under the direction of}} Thomas H.

500|$|Julia visited Mimi's house {{nearly every}} day, {{where they would}} chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when it was warm. On the evening of 15July 1958, Nigel Walley went to visit Lennon and found Julia and Mimi talking by the front gate. Lennon was not there, as {{he was at the}} Blomfield Road house. Walley {{accompanied}} Julia to the bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard [...] "a loud thud", and turned to see her body [...] "flying through the air"—which landed about [...] from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically.|$|E
500|$|Smith had [...] "an intimacy" [...] {{with the}} level design tools such that he could sense when the design met the game's {{technical}} restrictions, like the maximum possible size or number of characters for a room. He suggested the narrower skill tree with palpable effects, such as exchanging skills about weapon damage for more accessible weapons. The team adopted the cuts, having been encouraged by the recent milestone. Spector has said that had <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beta to have made the same reductions (as per common practice), [...] "it {{would have been a}} disaster." [...] Spector's post-proto-mission strategy was to bring the rest of the missions to proto-mission functionality rather than perfecting the two existing proto-missions. He felt {{that this would be a}} more efficient use of staff time, even if it meant that the final product would be more [...] "bare-bones" [...] than brilliant. Almost all of their game systems besides the inventory and conversation schemes were rethought up through the end of the project.|$|E
500|$|Bruce and Utsler did {{not expect}} many of their fans to attend Woodstock 1999, and were {{surprised}} when thousands of people chanted [...] "I-C-P! I-C-P!" [...] as <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group to perform. Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay $2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage. Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to [...] "give something back." [...] According to Bruce, [...] "We brought along these big beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had a hundred dollars taped to them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then we rolled out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks taped to them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea." [...] Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience {{was not allowed to}} get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.|$|E

Further {{references}} to difficulties with Warner Bros were included in [...] "I Am The Mob", but they preferred working with producer TommyD on the production than they had with those on Way Beyond Blue. The first single off the album had intended to be [...] "Mulder and Scully", but the label insisted that [...] "I Am the Mob" [...] was released instead.

The two of them played bridge at nights while <b>they</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cosmotron to become available. Cronin had built {{a new kind of}} detector, a spark chamber spectrometer, and Fitch realized that it would be perfect for experiments with K mesons (now known as kaons), which Yale University physicist Robert Adair had suggested had interesting properties worth investigating. They could decay into either matter or antimatter. Along with two colleagues, James Christenson and René Turlay, they set up their experiment on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven. They discovered an unexpected result. The decay of neutral K mesons did not respect CP symmetry. K mesons that decayed into positrons did so faster than those that decayed into electrons.0 Meson |last=Christenson |first=J. H. |last2=Cronin |first2=J. W. |last3=Fitch |first3=V.
