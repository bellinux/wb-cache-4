Our {{aim is to}} begin {{to account for the}} nonhuman, &# 039;more-than-human&# 039;, bodies, actors and forces that participate in creative work. In pursuing this aim, we do not intend to eliminate the human subject from analysis of creative practice; rather we will provide a more &# 039;symmetrical&# 039; account of creativity, alert to both the human and nonhuman constituents of creative practice. We draw from Deleuze and Guattari&# 039;s discussion of the assemblage to develop this account. Based on this discussion, we will define the creative assemblage as a more or less <b>temporary</b> <b>mixture</b> of heterogeneous material, affective and semiotic forces, within which particular capacities for creativity emerge, alongside the creative practices these capacities express. Within this assemblage, creativity and creative practice are less the innate attributes of individual bodies, and more a function of particular encounters and alliances between human and nonhuman bodies. We ground this discussion in qualitative research conducted in Melbourne, Australia, among creative professionals working in diverse fields. Based on this research, we propose a &# 039;diagram&# 039; of one local assemblage of creativity and the human and nonhuman alliances it relies on. We close by briefly reflecting on the implications of our analysis for debates regarding the diversity of creative work and the character of creative labour...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} natural and {{ecological}} ways of reversibility, setting arable land aside, is estab-lishing a temporary grass stand with a special management and biomass utilisation (Firbank et al. 2003). The influence {{of the way of}} the setting, the land aside on the following crops, its means on their nutrition and weed control requirements, is often researched. Pure stands of legumes are important as good forecrops especially in the agricultural systems with limited inputs, but they have a very low coverage in winter. Grass stands have a be�er coverage but nitrogen fertilisation is necessary when they are des-tined for more years of growing to maintain complete and dense sward. <b>Temporary</b> grass-legume <b>mixtures</b> with different species and components shared can be a good solution (Svobodová et al. 2001). The utilisation of the produced biomass is the other problem. If it is not used for example as a source of energy, it is necessary to leave it on the field surface, best cut up as a mulch, that is for a source of nutrients and organic matter for the soil microflora, microfauna and plants. The influence of mulching on yields and botanical composition of temporary grass monoculture stands was researched on the arable land by Šantrůček et al. (2002), on perennial grass stands for example by Kvítek et al. (1998), Fiala and Gaisler (2000). The relations amon...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the capacity of different <b>temporary</b> grassland legume-grass <b>mixtures</b> under different N supply levels to supply similar amounts of elements in systems where the herbage is cut and feed. Mixtures showed a good robustness in supplying equal amounts of mineral elements in the combined herbage as well as equal concentrations in dry matter of mineral elements compared to the same species in monocultures. The reasons for the mixed systems {{to be able to}} buffer differences in N supply levels as well as different compositions of the mixtures were that legume leaves and stems had similar concentrations of mineral elements, whether in monocultures or in mixtures with grasses. Grasses in mixture with legumes had however higher N, Ca, S, Zn, Cu and tended to have higher Mg concentration, both in stems and leaves, while Mn were less concentrated in mixtures dry matter. Further, the mixtures doubled their dry matter accumulation in the two weeks just around grass heading. The systems partly buffered the time-wise differences {{in the sense that the}} P accumulation paralleled dry matter but the N was diluted. This was mirrored in a decrease in N concentration and maintenance of the concentration level of P and other elements. As the stem-leaf ratio was higher (P< 0. 05) in festulolium than in ryegrass and as the stems of festulolium has lower concentrations of N, K, Ca, S, Mg, Fe and Cu than leaves, the mixtures including festulolium had a rapidly declining proportion of these elements in the combined mixtures’ dry matter. Management options in improving the mineral supplies are thus to chose species when establishing the temporary grasslands according to functionality, to manipulate the content of legumes by the N supply level, and to time the harvest of the herbage...|$|R
