5|$|In {{the course}} of Romanization, <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> polytheism of the local tribes was merged – syncretized – with the Roman religion. <b>The</b> <b>Celtic</b> deities came to be worshiped under {{the names of their}} Roman counterparts. Thus Lugus was {{replaced}} by Mercury, Belenus by Apollo, Taranis by Jupiter and so forth, in a practice called interpretatio romana by Caesar, who pioneered it. Roman gods also acquired the names of local gods as epithets; thus Mars was venerated as Mars Caturix, Mercury as Mercurius Cissonius and Jupiter as Jupiter Poeninus after the god of the Pennine Alps.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{significant}} Celtic finds in Lesser Poland are the extensive and wealthy settlement in Podłęże and its associated cemetery in Zakrzowiec, both in Wieliczka County, and a multi-period settlement complex in Aleksandrowice, Kraków County. The Podłęże site was occupied from the mid-3rd century BC on and yielded many metal objects, coins and coin blank molds, large collection of glass bracelets. The Zakrzowiec Celtic graves have the form of large (several metres long) dugout rectangular enclosures containing the ashes and grave offerings, such as pottery and personal ornaments. Graves of the same type but of a later period, 1st to 2nd century AD, are also found around Kraków, which demonstrates continuation of <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> tradition even after the arrival of Germanic tribes in the area. <b>The</b> <b>Celtic</b> burial site investigated in Aleksandrowice contains a rich 2nd century BC assemblage of funerary gifts including iron weapons and decorative elements. The unique fancy decorations, including a sheath with a recurring dragon motif, relate the findings only to <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> settlement area in Slovenia and western Croatia.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> {{domination}} in {{this part}} of Europe {{was coming to an end}} and the borders of the Roman Empire had gotten much closer, the Przeworsk culture people were being subjected to the Greco-Roman world's influence with a rapidly growing intensity.|$|E

50|$|In the Eastern Conference Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> faced Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton and the Detroit Pistons.

5|$|Because of its mild climate, many species, {{including}} sub-tropical {{species such}} as palm trees, are grown in Ireland.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Celtic</b> peoples {{established}} {{a number of}} settlement centers, {{beginning in the early}} 4th century BC, mostly in southern Poland, which was at the outer edge of their expansion.

5|$|The Roman {{presence}} in Scotland was however {{little more than}} a series of relatively brief interludes of partial military occupation.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> took <b>the</b> {{first two}} games, but the Lakers would blow <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> {{out with a}} 20-point {{differential}} in Game 3. Although <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> would take Game 4, the Lakers would win Game 5 and fuel speculation that the young Lakers were about to surge past <b>the</b> older <b>Celtics.</b> A defiant Bill Russell denied that any such thing was going to happen. Sure enough, despite several close games, including the decisive game only having a three-point differential once again, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> would only require six games to close out the Lakers this time.|$|R

5|$|As {{with the}} earlier {{construction}} of nearby Battersea Bridge, during excavations workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians {{to conclude that the}} area was the site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain.

5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained about the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Celtic</b> life in the early Christian era.

For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> {{were unable}} to repeat their title in 1987 despite several {{dramatic}} playoff victories.

In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> split <b>the</b> first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in <b>the</b> game: a <b>Celtics</b> ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma.
