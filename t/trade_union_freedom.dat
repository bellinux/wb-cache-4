As <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>freedom</b> is one of the fundamental rights related to work, it does not apply either. The article analyses the compatibility of the dispositions about foreigners that, in this respect, condition the exercise of the freedom of syndication, to the authorization of permanence in the country or residence permission with the scope of application of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>freedom</b> right provided by the Spanish Bill of Rights.

Firstly, it will {{identify}} what level of freedom of association as a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> right is deemed acceptable at the international and European levels. At the international level the ILO and ESC standards will be looked at, while at the regional level I will research the case law of the two European Courts – CJEU and ECtHR. Secondly, {{the standards of the}} CJEU and ECtHR will be compared to each other. This way, we will know which of the two protects <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> rights better and where there might be flaws. Thirdly, after comparing the CJEU and ECtHR standards with each other, they will be compared to the international standards of the ILO and ESC. This way I will check how the regional standards are in concert with the international standards that are respected worldwide. Finally, the prospects of EU accession to the ECHR will be looked at.

This especially goes for the sphere of collective bargaining, which today remains with many questions open which result in the fact that such bargaining is in terrible crisis, i. e, collective employment contracts are more and more being left out of the legal system, as the most important autonomous acts of regulation of labour relations.

40|$|The essay {{analyses}} the ECJ decisions Viking and Laval {{where the}} court was called {{to answer the question}} of her jurisdiction upon <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> <b>freedom</b> of association and the right to take industrial action. The Author focuses on the court’s rationale with special regard to the following statements: (a) the horizontal effect of ECT articles 43 (freedom of establishment) and 49 (freedom of providing services), according to which private undertakings can rely upon free movement provisions against <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> since industrial action aims at concluding collective agreements and collective agreements fall within the scope of free movement provisions; (b) the right to take industrial action amounts at a fundamental right guaranteed by community law, {{but at the same time}} it also constitutes a restriction upon fundamental economic freedom, and it is a competence of the ECJ to strike a balance between them; (c) as far as the balancing between free movement and industrial action is concerned, industrial action, even when justified by the legitimate (non discriminatory) aim of workers protection, is subject to the proportionality test. A critical analysis of the above mentioned statements leads the Author to conclude the essay with some remarks on the theoretical and practical consequences of the ECJ interference in the balancing of “internal” constitutional values...|$|R

40|$|The essay explores {{some recent}} law {{reforms in the}} field of {{individual}} and collective labour relations and focuses on the lowering of the level of protectiveness towards workers they seem to foster as well as on their effect on the system of sources of regulation (i. e. the shift from legislative regulation to contractual norms; from nation-wide collective agreements to plant-level agreements). In this perspective, the author focuses on the consistence of these trends with constitutional principles and rules concerning <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>freedom</b> and collective bargaining. To this end, the author offers an analysis of relevant doctrine and case law and suggests re-reading some basic decisions issued by the Constitutional Court over the time, arguing they still deserve due attention.

40|$|Flexisecurity, {{right to}} work and labor {{stability}} This article deals {{with one of the}} most recent and innovative proposals of related flexibilization, basically, to the extinction of labor relation and that areknown as «flexisecurity» or «flexicurity». For this, the author comments the model of Denmark – country in which it’s originated «flexisecurity» – emphasizing the configuration of a «golden triangle», composed of: i) flexibility in the labor relation, aimed at facilitating the dismissal ii) a generous system of unemployment benefits, funded primarily by the State and iii) a new policy of «activation» of the labor market, which seeks to keep large sectors of the population permanently trained to meet new labor challenges. The author emphasizes the difference between our country and Denmark, since it is a Welfare State with a high level of social protection funded by a fiscal pressure and high tax rates. Finally, the article notes that for the study of «flexisecurity» it shouldn’t ignore the legal framework derived from workers’ fundamental rights established in the Constitution and international treaties which imply: {{right to work}}, dignity and citizenship of the worker and <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Freedom</b> and Collective Rights</p...|$|E

The second part of the essay, instead, gives details on the debate taking place in Italy at the beginning of the ‘ 30 s when, right after the institution of the National Council of Corporations, a heated debate took place on the fortunes of the corporatist ideal which was supposed to characterize its evolution in the strictly fascist view. This debate reached its peak during the second conference on trade unionist and corporatist studies, which took place in Ferrara from 5 th to 8 th May 1932. During the conference, the most authoritative doctrine of the time got divided into “privatistic”, proponent of the “logic of distinction”, and “publicistic” who supported a corporatist evolution of the fascist system. In this perspective, the paper deepens the features of the confrontation through an analysis of the ideas brought forward by Arnaldo Volpicelli and Ugo Spirito, champions of the totalitarian logic, who launched the famous theory on “property corporation” right on that occasion, and the ideas expressed by Santi Romano and Francesco Carnelutti, interpreters of the “logic of distinction” and thereby of the primacy of private law. The conclusions are dedicated to an analysis of the reasons which led, in post-World War II times and thank to the constitutional recognition of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>freedom,</b> to the establishing of private law as tool of choice for the regulation of trade unionism. paper {{is devoted to}} the historic reconstruction of the origins of an old division between “privatistic” and “publicistic” scholars of trade unionism.
