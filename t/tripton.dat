50|$|In aquatic ecosystems, it {{is likely}} that the {{absorption}} spectrum of water, along with gilvin and <b>tripton</b> (dissolved and particulate organic matter, respectively), determines phototrophic niche differentiation. The six shoulders in the light absorption of water between wavelengths 400 and 1100 nm correspond to troughs in the collective absorption of at least twenty diverse species of phototrophic bacteria. Another effect is due to the overall trend for water to absorb low frequencies, while gilvin and <b>tripton</b> absorb higher ones. This is why open ocean appears blue and supports yellow species such as Prochlorococcus, which contains divinyl-chlorophyll a and b. Synechococcus, colored red with phycoerythrin, is adapted to coastal bodies, while phycocyanin allows Cyanobacteria to thrive in darker inland waters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two commercially {{available}} dentine-adhesive systems, Tenure and <b>Tripton,</b> {{were tested in}} two different cavity designs by placing 132 Class V composite restorations in cervical lesions of 35 patients. In Group A, the cervical restorations were placed totally in dentine without any intentional enamel involvement. In Group B, they were placed in dentine with adjacent enamel margins bevelled and acid etched. The retention rate, the evidence of clinical microleakage, and the marginal integrity were monitored over a 2 -year period. The results of this clinical investigation indicate a high failure rate when only dentinal bonding was involved. A loss rate of 30 % for Tenure and 55 % for <b>Tripton</b> was noted in Group A after 2 years of clinical service. However, both adhesive systems used in combination with micromechanical retention on the enamel border (Group B) performed extremely well with only one restoration each having debonded over the 2 -year period. Identically, marginal integrity and evidence of clinical microleakage more severely deteriorated with time for the Group A restorations in comparison with their Group B counterparts. In summary, the overall results were more positive for Tenure than for <b>Tripton.</b> It is concluded that micromechanical retention by acid etching of the enamel margin is still indispensable for the clinical success of cervical Class V composite restorations, primarily for retention and clinical microleakage and also, but to a lesser degree, for marginal adaptation...|$|E

The {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), relative RMSE (RRMSE), mean relative error (MRE) and similarity coefficient (SC) were used to assess the performance of the models. Phytoplankton absorption aph(440) and aph(675) ranged from 0. 03 to 8. 39 m– 1 and from 0. 02 to 5. 21 m– 1, respectively, including a large variability for particles and phytoplankton concentrations (total suspended matter: 1. 6 – 191 mg L– 1; chlorophyll a: 0. 4 – 477. 1 µg L– 1). For the best model, model 6, <b>tripton</b> absorption was modeled using an exponential model with a background constant. The ratios of aph(380) /aph(505), aph(580) /aph(692. 5) and aph(510) /aph(412) were used to model the spectral absorption of phytoplankton. The best performance of the partition models tended to a slight overestimation with the RRMSE equal to 44. 4 %, 27. 0 %, 33. 5 % and 40. 1 % for aph(400), aph(440), aph(675) and aph(PAR), respectively. The precision of the numerical method was largely determined by the total particle composition and the relative contribution of phytoplankton to the total particulate matter. Overall, the numerical partition model provides a reasonable estimation of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, which enables us to retrieve the concentration of optically active substances from in situ measurements and remote sensing ocean color data. ...|$|E

40|$|Remote {{estimation}} of water constituent concentrations in case II waters {{has been a}} great challenge, primarily due to the complex interactions among the phytoplankton, <b>tripton,</b> colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and pure water. Semi-analytical algorithms for estimating constituent concentrations are effective and easy to implement, but two challenges remain. First, a dataset without a sampling bias is needed to calibrate estimation models; and second, the semi-analytical indices were developed based on several specific assumptions that may not be universally applicable. In this study, a semi-analytical model-optimizing and look-up-table (SAMO-LUT) method was proposed to address these two challenges. The SAMO-LUT method is based on three previous semi-analytical models to estimate chlorophyll a, <b>tripton</b> and CDOM. Look-up tables and an iterative searching strategy were used to obtain the most appropriate parameters in the models. Three datasets (i. e., noise-free simulation data, in situ data and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data) were collected to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the SAMO-LUT method yields error-free results for the ideal simulation dataset; and is able also to accurately estimate the water constituent concentrations with an average bias (mean normalized bias, MNB) lower than 9 % and relative random uncertainty (normalized root mean square error, NRMS) lower than 34 % even for in situ and MERIS data.

Our results, obtained from a 450 km sampling transect, demonstrate that tributaries exert a profound impact on the receiving river's photosynthetic potential.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how techniques developed for the remote sensing of water quality parameters(chlorophyll a, <b>tripton</b> and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) in inland waters in temperate northern hemisphere environments could be adapted or improved to allow them to be applied to tropical and sub-tropical water bodies. This aim was achieved by adapting existing image based atmospheric correction techniques, by measuring and modelling the specific inherent optical properties of water quality parameters in a selection of the Northern Australian water bodies and by modifying existing inversion algorithms. The final algorithms were applied to a tropical water body using the MERIS sensor to determine the monitoring accuracy and precision that could be expected for each water quality parameter. The water quality parameter specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs) were measured in three large water storages in north-eastern Australia, Wivenhoe Dam (27 ° 21 ´ S, 152 ° 36 ´ E), Fairbairn Dam (23 ° 42 ´ S, 148 ° 02 ´ E) and Burdekin Falls Dam (20 ° 37 ´ S, 147 ° 0 ´ E). Three existing MERIS atmospheric correction methods were applied and found to be unsuitable because they use inappropriate water leaving radiance assumptions. A site specific atmospheric correction method was developed that utilised the 6 S atmospheric model and the reflectance of the dense dark vegetation that surrounded the study sites. The study used two inversion methods, the direct, Matrix Inversion Method (MIM) and the stochastic, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO. Both methods were implemented on an over-determined system of reflectance equations with semi-analytic models of the anisotropy of the in-water light field. The MIM used differential weighting for each sensor band and the PSO used four different reflectance matching criteria. The SIOPs, the typical water quality constituent concentrations and the Hydrolight® radiative transfer model were used to simulate reflectance spectra that could be employed to parameterise the reflectance models and investigate how the inversion methods performed in the presence of noise. The methods were applied to two images of Burdekin Falls Dam and the results were validated against in situ measurements. The results of the application of the MIM algorithm showed that the best weighting scheme had a mean chlorophyll a retrieval error of 1. 0 μg/l, the conventional three band scheme had a mean error of 4. 2 μg/l and the unweighted scheme had a mean error of 5. 5 μg/l. For <b>tripton,</b> the best performed weighting scheme had a mean error of 1. 2 mg/l, the three band scheme had a mean error of 3. 4 mgl- 1 and the unweighted scheme had a mean error of 1. 8 mgl- 1. For the CDOM retrieval, the mean error was found to be 0. 12 /m for the best performed weighting scheme, 0. 25 /m for the three band scheme and 0. 52 /m for the unweighted scheme. In the case of the PSO the mean retrieval error of the best performed similarity measure was 2. 0 μg/l, 2. 45 mg/l and 0. 3 /m for chlorophyll a, <b>tripton</b> and CDOM respectively. The study concluded that the atmospheric correction methods for MERIS images of Northern Australian inland waters cannot rely on site independent a priori knowledge of the water leaving radiance that has been developed from other environments and that instead, images of inland water bodies can be corrected by taking advantage of dense dark vegetation surrounding the impoundment. It also concluded that there was sufficient intra-impoundment variation in the specific absorption and specific scattering of phytoplankton and <b>tripton</b> to require a well distributed network of measurement stations when characterising a new water body and that some inland water bodies may need more than one SIOP set to characterise the optical domains present. Significant improvements in the accuracy and precision of retrieved water quality parameter values can be obtained by using semi-analytically estimated values for the anisotropy factor and that over-determined systems of equations can be used to mitigate the effect of unknown and inherent sources of error in the remote sensing system. After application of the modified retrieval algorithms it was found that optical closure can be used to identify the most appropriate SIOP set in water bodies that have multiple SIOP domains, the over-determined weighted MIM algorithm can be more accurate and precise than the conventional three band or unweighted approach and the PSO does not offer improvements in accuracy and precision sufficient enough to justify the increased computational overhead in the inversion...|$|E
40|$|A {{database}} {{has been}} established for relating subsurface irradiance reflectance, i. e. water ’colour‘, to the optical properties and water quality parameters of more than 120 Dutch inland water bodies. The concentrations of total chlorophyll-a (TChl-a = chlorophyll-a plus phaeopigment), total suspended matter and the Secchi-disc depth varied between 0. 6 and 468 mg m- 3, 0. 8 and 98 g m- 3, and 0. 15 and 5. 50 m, respectively. The water bodies represented very different water types based on morphometry and hydrology. The depth ranged from 0. 4 to 40 m, and the surface area from 0. 25 ha (fens in the moorland Peel) to 1200 km 2 (Lake IJsselmeer). The mean specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 676 nm was 0. 013 ± 0. 003 m 2 (mg TChl-a) - 1. The absorption by <b>tripton</b> and dissolved humic substances at 440 nm varied between 0. 1 and 16. 4 m- 1, and 0. 1 and 65. 5 m- 1, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Theunderwater light field inasmallarcticlakeon Victoria Island,Northwest Territories, was examined. Downward {{radiance}} {{was found}} to be bimodal, with transmission peaks at 480 and 640 nanometres (nm, or 10 - 9 m). Upward radiance was similar near the surface, with peaks at 480 and 620 nm, but became unimodal with depth and shifted to 580 nm near the bottom. Diurnal variation in the underwater downward and upward irradiance of PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) was approximately two orders of magnitude. The spectral quality of light transmission also changed over this 24 hour period. Unimodal transmission of red light occurred in the early morning (1 :OO and 5 :OO) and late evening (22 : 00), while bimodal transmission of blue-green and red light was observed during the day (900 - 1730). Kd(z,), the vertical attenuation coefficient for d wnward irradiance at the midpoint of the euphotic zone, was relatively insensitive to changes in solar elevation. Diurnal variation in the reflectance of PAR differed from that predicted by previous simulation models, while t e inverse relationship between reflectance and the absorption coefficient was in agreement with these same models. Gilvin, humic material-dissolved iron complexes, algal fucoxanthin, chlorophyll a and <b>tripton</b> all contribute to the attenuation of light and are responsible for the unique underwater spectral transmission in Keyhole Lake...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of coastal and coral reef environments requires regular collection of accurate information on recognized ecosystem health indicators. Satellite image data and derived maps of water column and substrate biophysical properties {{provide an opportunity}} to develop baseline mapping and monitoring programs for coastal and coral reef ecosystem health indicators. A significant challenge for satellite image data in coastal and coral reef water bodies is the mixture of both clear and turbid waters. A new approach is presented in this paper to enable production of water quality and substrate cover type maps, linked to a field based coastal ecosystem health indicator monitoring program, for use in turbid to clear coastal and coral reef waters. An optimized optical domain method was applied to map selected water quality (Secchi depth, Kd PAR, <b>tripton,</b> CDOM) and substrate cover type (seagrass, algae, sand) parameters. The approach is demonstrated using commercially available Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data over a coastal embayment exhibiting the range of substrate cover types and water quality conditions commonly found in sub-tropical and tropical coastal environments. Spatially extensive and quantitative maps of selected water quality and substrate cover parameters were produced for the study site. These map products were refined by interactions with management agencies to suit the information requirements of their monitoring and management programs. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: Laboratory {{testing of}} dentin {{adhesive}} systems still requires corroboration by long-term clinical trials for their ultimate clinical effectiveness to be validated. The {{objective of this}} clinical investigation was to evaluate, retrospectively, the clinical effectiveness of earlier-investigated dentin adhesive systems (Scotchbond, Gluma, Clearfil New Bond, Scotchbond 2, Tenure, and <b>Tripton),</b> and to compare their clinical results with those obtained with four modern total-etch adhesive systems (Bayer exp. 1 and 2, Clearfil Liner Bond System, and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose). In total, 1177 Class V cervical lesions {{in the teeth of}} 346 patients were restored following two cavity designs: In Group A, enamel was neither beveled nor intentionally etched, as per ADA guidelines; in Group B, adjacent enamel was beveled and conditioned. Clinical retention rates definitely indicated the improved clinical efficacy of the newest dentin adhesives over the earlier systems. With regard to adhesion strategy, adhesive systems that removed the smear layer and concurrently demineralized the dentin surface layer performed clinically better than systems that modified the disorderly layer of smear debris without complete removal. Hybridization by resin interdiffusion into the exposed dentinal collagen layer, combined with attachment of resin tags into the opened dentin tubules, appeared to be essential for reliable dentin bonding but might be insufficient by itself. The additional formation of an elastic bonding area as a polymerization shrinkage absorber and the use of a microfine restorative composite apparently guaranteed an efficient clinical result. The perfect one-year retention recorded for Clearfil Liner Bond System and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose must be confirmed at later recalls...|$|E
40|$|Compared {{to natural}} waters, mine waters {{represent}} an extreme water type that is frequently heavily polluted. Although {{they have been}} traditionally monitored by in situ measurements of point samples taken at regular intervals, {{the emergence of a}} new generation of multispectral and hyperspectral (HS) sensors means that image spectroscopy has the potential to become a modern method for monitoring polluted surface waters. This paper describes an approach employing linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) for analysis of hyperspectral image data to map the relative abundances of mine water components (dissolved Fe—Fediss, dissolved organic carbon—DOC, undissolved particles). The ground truth data (8 monitored ponds) were used to validate the results of spectral mapping. The same approach applied to HS data was tested using the image data resampled to WorldView 2 (WV 2) spectral resolution. A key aspect of the image data processing was to define the proper pure image end members for the fundamental water types. The highest correlations detected between the studied water parameters and the fractional images using the HyMap and the resampled WV 2 data, respectively, were: dissolved Fe (R 2 = 0. 74 and R 2 vw 2 = 0. 6), undissolved particles (R 2 = 0. 57 and R 2 vw 2 = 0. 49) and DOC (R 2 = 0. 42 and R 2 vw 2 < 0. 40). These fractional images were further classified to create semi-quantitative maps. In conclusion, the classification still benefited from the higher spectral resolution of the HyMap data; however the WV 2 reflectance data can be suitable for mapping specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs), which significantly differ from one another from an optical point of view (e. g., mineral suspension, dissolved Fe and phytoplankton), but it seems difficult to differentiate among diverse suspension particles, especially when the waters have more complex properties (e. g., mineral particles, DOC together with <b>tripton</b> or other particles, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater {{accounts}} for just 2. 5 % of the earth’s water resources, and its quality and availability are becoming {{an issue of}} global concern in the 21 st century. Growing human population, over-exploitation of water sources and pressures of global warming mean that both water quantity and quality are affected. In order to effectively manage water quality {{there is a need}} for increased monitoring and predictive modelling of freshwater resources. To address these concerns in New Zealand inland waters, an approach which integrates biological and physical sciences is needed. Remote sensing has the potential to allow this integration and vastly increase the temporal and spatial resolution of current monitoring techniques, which typically involve collecting grab-samples. In a complementary way, lake modelling has the potential to enable more effective management of water resources by testing the effectiveness of a range of possible management scenarios prior to implementation. Together, the combination of remote sensing and modelling data allows for improved model initialisation, calibration and validation, which ultimately aid in understanding of complex lake ecosystem processes. This study investigated the use of remote sensing using empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll a (chl a), <b>tripton,</b> suspended minerals (SM), total suspended sediment (SS) and water surface temperature. It demonstrated the use of spatially resolved statistical techniques for comparing satellite estimated and 3 -D simulated water quality and temperature. An automated procedure was developed for retrieval of chl a from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery, using 106 satellite images captured from 1999 to 2011. Radiative transfer-based atmospheric correction was applied to images using the Second Simulation of the Satellite in the Solar Spectrum model (6 sv). For the estimation of chl a over a time series of images, the use of symbolic regression resulted in a significant improvement in the precision of chl a hindcasts compared with traditional regression equations. Results from this investigation suggest that remote sensing provides a valuable tool to assess temporal and spatial distributions of chl a. Bio-optical models were applied to quantify the physical processes responsible for the relationship between chl a concentrations and subsurface irradiance reflectance used in regression algorithms, allowing the identification of possible sources of error in chl a estimation. While the symbolic regression model was more accurate than traditional empirical models, it was still susceptible to errors in optically complex waters such as Lake Rotorua, due to the effect of variations of SS and CDOM on reflectance. Atmospheric correction of Landsat 7 ETM+ thermal data was carried out for the purpose of retrieval of lake water surface temperature in Rotorua lakes, and Lake Taupo, North Island, New Zealand. Atmospheric correction was repeated using four sources of atmospheric profile data as input to a radiative transfer model, MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) v. 3. 7. The retrieved water temperatures from 14 images between 2007 and 2009 were validated using a high-frequency temperature sensor deployed from a mid-lake monitoring buoy at the water surface of Lake Rotorua. The most accurate temperature estimation for Lake Rotorua was with radiosonde data as an input into MODTRAN, followed by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 2, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Level 3, and NASA data. Retrieved surface water temperature was used for assessing spatial heterogeneity of surface water temperature simulated with a three-dimensional (3 -D) hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) of Lake Rotoehu, located approximately 20 km east of Lake Rotorua. This comparison demonstrated that simulations reproduced the dominant horizontal variations in surface water temperature in the lake. The transport and mixing of a geothermal inflow and basin-scale circulation patterns were inferred from thermal distributions from satellite and model estimations of surface water temperature and a spatially resolved statistical evaluation was used to validate simulations. This study has demonstrated the potential of accurate satellite-based thermal monitoring to validate water surface temperature simulated by 3 -D hydrodynamic models. Semi-analytical and empirical algorithms were derived to determine spatial and temporal variations in SS in Lake Ellesmere, South Island, New Zealand, using MODIS band 1. The semi-analytical model and empirical model had a similar level of precision in SS estimation, however, the semi-analytical model has the advantage of being applicable to different satellite sensors, spatial locations, and SS concentration ranges. The estimations of SS concentration (and estimated SM concentration) from the semi-analytical model were used for a spatially resolved validation of simulations of SM derived from ELCOM-CAEDYM. Visual comparisons were compared with spatially-resolved statistical techniques. The spatial statistics derived from the Map Comparison Kit allowed a non-subjective and quantitative method to rank simulation performance on different dates. The visual and statistical comparison between satellite estimated and model simulated SM showed that the model did not perform well in reproducing both basin-scale and fine-scale spatial variation in SM derived from MODIS satellite imagery. Application of the semi-analytical model to estimate SS over the lifetime of the MODIS sensor will greatly extend its spatial and temporal coverage for historical monitoring purposes, and provide a tool to validate SM simulated by 1 -D and 3 -D models on a daily basis. A bio-optical model was developed to derive chl a, SS concentrations, and coloured dissolved organic matter /detritus absorption at 443 nm, from MODIS Aqua subsurface remote sensing reflectance of Lake Taupo, a large, deep, oligotrophic lake in North Island, New Zealand. The model was optimised using in situ inherent optical properties (IOPs) from the literature. Images were atmospherically corrected using the radiative transfer model 6 sv. Application of the bio-optical model using a single chl a-specific absorption spectrum (a*ϕ(λ)) resulted in low correlation between estimated and observed values. Therefore, two different absorption curves were used, based on the seasonal dominance of phytoplankton phyla with differing absorption properties. The application of this model resulted in reasonable agreement between modelled and in situ chl a concentrations. Highest concentrations were observed during winter when Bacillariophytes (diatoms) dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. On 4 and 5 March 2004 an unusually large turbidity current was observed originating from the Tongariro River inflow in the south-east of the lake. In order to resolve fine details of the plume, empirical relationships were developed between MODIS band 1 reflectance (250 m resolution) and SS estimated from MODIS bio-optical features (1 km resolution) were used estimate SS at 250 m resolution. Complex lake circulation patterns were observed including a large clockwise gyre. With the development of this bio-optical model MODIS can potentially be used to remotely sense water quality in near real time, and the relationship developed for B 1 SS allows for resolution of fine-scale features such turbidity currents...|$|E
