5|$|While {{the border}} on land was firmly {{set in the}} early 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> were still in {{disagreement}} {{on the path of}} the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In Michigan v. Ohio, the court upheld a special master's report and ruled that the boundary between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. One consequence of the court decision was that tiny Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because each {{configuration}} {{has only}} a bounded number of predecessors, the evolution of Rule 90 preserves the entropy of any configuration. In particular, if an infinite initial configuration is selected by choosing the state of each cell independently at random, with each of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> being equally likely to be selected, then each subsequent configuration can be described by exactly the same probability distribution.|$|E

40|$|A popular {{approach}} to the computational modeling of ligand/receptor interactions is to use an empirical free energy like model with adjustable parameters. Parameters are learned from one set of complexes, then used to predict another set. To improve these empirical methods requires an independent way to study their inherent errors. We introduce a toy model of ligand/receptor binding as a workbench for testing such errors. We study the errors incurred from <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>state</b> binding assumption [...] the assumption that a ligand is either bound in one orientation, or unbound. We find that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>state</b> assumption can cause large errors in free energy predictions, {{but it does not}} affect rank order predictions significantly. We show that fitting parameters using data from high affinity ligands can reduce <b>two</b> <b>state</b> errors; so can using more physical models that do not use <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>state</b> assumption. We also find that when using <b>two</b> <b>state</b> models to predict free energies, errors are more severe on high affinity ligands than low affinity ligands. And we show that <b>two</b> <b>state</b> errors can be diagnosed by systematically adding new binding modes when predicting free energies: if predictions worsen as the modes are added, then <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>state</b> assumption in <b>the</b> fitting step may be at fault...|$|R

5|$|The Jin persisted {{with their}} advance into the {{remaining}} Song territories {{south of the}} Yangtze. They faced an insurgency of Song loyalists in the north, the deaths of some important leaders, and military offensives by Song generals like Yue Fei. The Jurchens created the puppet government of Da Qi {{to serve as a}} buffer state between Song and Jin, but Qi failed to defeat the Song. The Jin abolished Qi in 1137. As the Jin gave up on conquering the Southern Song, diplomatic talks for a peace treaty resumed. Signed in 1142, the Treaty of Shaoxing established the boundary between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> along the Huai River, which runs north of the Yangtze. The treaty forbade the Song from purchasing horses from the Jin, but smuggling continued in the border markets. The relations between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> were mostly peaceful from 1142 to 1161, the year Wanyan Liang went to war.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states.</b> Due to a chronic lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio {{was able to}} restart construction, and by 1983, both states had completed construction on the freeway. The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway System at the time of construction.

5|$|In 1917, as {{a result}} of the October Revolution, Russia became a {{communist}} state. In the aftermath of World War I, Poland reemerged as an independent country in the following year. From 1919 to 1921, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> fought the Polish–Soviet War which was concluded with the Peace of Riga. Article 11 of the peace treaty required that the Soviet side return all culturally significant collections and items that had been removed from Poland since the First Partition in 1772. A special bilateral committee was set up to carry out the restitution of cultural goods. In 1928, the committee's efforts resulted in the return to Poland of, among other national treasures, Szczerbiec, which, after 133 years, was deposited back in the Wawel Castle.|$|E

Indiana would spend up to $8 million and the City of Jeffersonville would provide $2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of a ramp to the Big Four Bridge. Kentucky pledged $12 million to replace the deck on the bridge and connect it to the spiral ramp that was completed in Waterfront Park.|$|E

5|$|In early 766 a {{prisoner}} exchange {{took place between}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> in western Cilicia, followed by a resumption of large-scale hostilities. In August 766, a large Abbasid army, comprising many different national contingents, under al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba and al-Abbas ibn Muhammad, the brother of Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), invaded Byzantine territory from Upper Mesopotamia and made for Kamacha. The campaign is dealt with briefly by Muslim historians such as al-Tabari, but is fully recorded in a contemporary Syriac Christian source, the so-called Zuqnin Chronicle, written by a monk of the Zuqnin Monastery near Amida.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania was {{increasingly}} {{threatened by the}} growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th and 16th centuries. Moscow indeed took over many of Lithuania's eastern possessions in military campaigns of 1471, 1492, and 1500. Grand Duke Alexander of Lithuania was elected King of Poland in 1501, {{after the death of}} John Albert. In 1506, he was succeeded by Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt I Stary) in both Poland and Lithuania as political realities were drawing <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states</b> closer together. Prior to his accession to the Polish throne, Sigismund had been a Duke of Silesia by the authority of his brother Vladislas II of Bohemia, but like other Jagiellon rulers before him, he did not pursue the claim of the Polish Crown to Silesia.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, the Foch Line was {{accepted}} by the Conference of Ambassadors as the provisional border between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states.</b> Lithuanians were not informed about this decision until August 3. Neither country was satisfied: both Lithuanian and Polish forces would have to retreat from the Suwałki and Vilnius regions, respectively. Those Germans still present in the region also objected to the boundary of the line. The Lithuanian forces (about 350 strong) left the town of Suwałki by August 7, but stopped in Sejny and formed a line at the Czarna Hańcza river – Wigry Lake. Lithuanians believed that the Foch Line was not the final decision, {{and that they had}} the duty to protect Lithuanian outposts in the region.|$|E

5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down.

Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of neighbors in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>states,</b> it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars {{led to the}} {{separation}} of Norway and Denmark.

5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with the Lithuanians in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down.

Poland also accused the Lithuanians of collaborating with the Soviets and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently.
