5|$|Brock had a {{successful}} pre-war military career and a quick rise through the ranks, which many commented on at the <b>time.</b> <b>Some</b> credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both {{on his way to}} prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock's ability to gain promotions even when the nation was at peace attests to his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances, and ambition.|$|E

5|$|Motul de San Jos√© {{was first}} settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it was {{probably}} a fairly small site. At this <b>time</b> <b>some</b> of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of which would have been small villages at this time, and they may have been settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1945, Wilson was {{replaced}} as assistant {{chief of staff}} by Major General Hoyt Vandenberg. For his service in the post, Wilson was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal. He was appointed to command the Air Force Proving Ground Command. At the <b>time,</b> <b>some</b> 22,000 airmen were assigned to this command.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the <b>time,</b> <b>some</b> members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E

5|$|Slavery {{in ancient}} Greece {{was a common}} practice, as was slavery in other {{societies}} at the <b>time.</b> <b>Some</b> writers in ancient Greece (including, most notably, Aristotle) considered slavery natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in Socratic dialogues; the Stoics produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Some comets are predictable, {{most famously}} Halley's Comet. Yet {{as a class}} of object they remain {{unpredictable}} and can appear at any <b>time.</b> <b>Some</b> have extremely lengthy orbital periods which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the Solar System once and so are inherently unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first <b>time</b> <b>some</b> of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E
5|$|The Reginae strain hybrids were {{produced}} by Jan de Graaff {{and his two}} sons in the Netherlands in the mid 19th century by crossing Hippeastrum vitatum and Hippeastrum striatum with Hippeastrum psittacinum {{and some of the}} better hybrids available in Europe at the <b>time.</b> <b>Some</b> of the most successful hybrids were Graveana and Empress of India.|$|E
5|$|The church {{remained}} incomplete {{for over}} ninety years. By 1957 Anglican services {{were being held}} in St Stephens, a wooden church next to the apparent ruin. Around this <b>time</b> <b>some</b> in the church showed interest in completion of the old structure, {{partly due to the}} approaching centenary of construction beginning. In April of that year a gathering of people from the Parish of Carrick was held in the unfinished building, and a prayer held to bless its completion. The gathering, and associated committee, were led and chaired by W R Barrett, assistant bishop of Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|The church's {{traditions of}} {{following}} the Sabbath, the Old Testament holy days, and tithing were initially retained. But some WCG ministers and members continued to express alarm over the doctrinal revisions Tkach had already made, {{and from time}} to <b>time</b> <b>some</b> would leave to create dissident branches. They included Tkach's one-time mentor, Roderick C. Meredith, who formed the Global Church of God in 1992. As various breakaway groups were established, additional clusters of church members followed.|$|E
5|$|The date of Agrippinas first performance, {{about which}} there was at one <b>time</b> <b>some</b> uncertainty, has been {{confirmed}} by a manuscript newsletter as 26 December 1709. The cast consisted of some of Northern Italy's leading singers of the day, including Antonio Carli in the lead bass role; Margherita Durastanti, who had recently sung the role of Mary Magdalene in Handel's La resurrezione; and Diamante Scarabelli, whose great success at Bologna in the 1697 pasticcio Perseo inspired {{the publication of a}} volume of eulogistic verse entitled La miniera del Diamante.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with <b>time,</b> <b>some</b> grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
