5|$|In 1898, the Kentucky General Assembly {{enacted a}} law which created a Board of Election Commissioners, {{appointed}} by the General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties. The board was empowered to examine election returns and certify the results. The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with the General Assembly under Section 153 of the state constitution. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> {{commonly referred to as}} the Goebel Election Law, a reference to its sponsor, President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate William Goebel. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko {{announced}} a new law in 2014 that will prohibit kolkhoz workers (around 9% of total work force) from leaving their jobs at will—a change of job and living location will require permission from governors. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> compared with serfdom by Lukashenko himself. Similar regulations were introduced for the forestry industry in 2012.|$|E
5|$|National {{and state}} AFL-CIO officials, fearing the New Jersey law might {{open the door}} to {{extensive}} new state regulation of labor unions, asked Local 54 to test the New Jersey law in court.

But if thou mean {{the light of}} <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> light of the gospel, or the Spirit of Christ, I must needs reprove thee. For I tell thee again, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not of faith, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> makes nothing perfect (Heb 7:19). <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> but a weak and {{unprofitable}} thing, as to justification (Heb 7:18), though as I said before, it is good if it be used lawfully; which is, not to seek or look for justification thereby, nor yet to say, it is the sprit of Christ.|$|R
5|$|On April 1, 1864, the Currency Reform Act of 1864 {{went into}} effect. This {{decreased}} the Southern money supply by one-third. However, because of Union {{control of the}} Mississippi River, until January 1865 <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> effective only east of the Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|Sanger's goal of {{challenging}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> fulfilled {{when she was}} indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their attention on articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than contraception.

5000|$|The phrase [...] "the <b>law</b> <b>is</b> an ass" [...] was {{popularized by}} Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, when the {{character}} Mr. Bumble is informed that [...] "the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction".

5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> changed again in 1972. In {{an attempt to}} reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{served as}} a Democratic New Mexico State Senator from 1955 to 1961. He was the first state senator to be elected from Los Alamos County. Senators served unpaid, {{receiving}} only a per diem allowance of five dollars. Since the New Mexico legislature convened for only 30 days in even numbered years and 60 days in odd numbered years, {{he was able to}} continue working at Los Alamos, taking leave without pay to attend. He attempted to reform New Mexico's liquor laws, which specified a minimum mark-up. He was unsuccessful in 1957, but <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> reformed in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>was</b> presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E

5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Krug led the {{challenge}} to {{the constitutionality of the}} Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for the Act's opponents; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> constitutional, but that internet filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. She said that filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare. She emphasized the need to educate children about morality instead of using online filters to block information from them. In 2006, she was elected Vice-President of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.|$|E
