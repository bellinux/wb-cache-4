5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E

Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache.

5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. <b>The</b> <b>headache</b> can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{headaches}} {{from head}} trauma and whiplash injury are well-known and common, but chronic headaches from {{other sorts of}} physical traumas are not recognized. Methods Specific information {{was obtained from the}} medical records of 15 consecutive patients with chronic headaches related to physically injurious traumatic events that did not include either head trauma or whiplash injury. The events and the physical injuries produced by them were noted. The headaches' development, characteristics, duration, frequency, and accompaniments were recorded, as were the patients' use of pain-alleviative drugs. From this latter information, <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> were classified by the diagnostic criteria of <b>the</b> International <b>Headache</b> Society as though they were naturally-occurring <b>headaches.</b> <b>The</b> presence of other post-traumatic symptoms and litigation were also recorded. Results The intervals between the events and the onset of <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> resembled those between head traumas or whiplash injuries and their subsequent <b>headaches.</b> <b>The</b> <b>headaches</b> themselves were, as a group, similar to those after head trauma and whiplash injury. Thirteen of the patients had chronic tension-type headache, two had migraine. The sustained bodily injuries were trivial or unidentifiable in nine patients. Fabrication of symptoms for financial remuneration was not evident in these patients of whom seven were not even seeking payments of any kind. Conclusions This study suggests that these hitherto unrecognized post-traumatic headaches constitute a class of headaches characterized by a relation to traumatic events affecting the body but not including head or whiplash traumas. The bodily injuries per se can be discounted as the cause of <b>the</b> <b>headaches.</b> So can fabrication of symptoms for financial remuneration. Altered mental states, not systematically evaluated here, were a possible cause of <b>the</b> <b>headaches.</b> <b>The</b> overall resemblance of these <b>headaches</b> to <b>the</b> <b>headaches</b> after head or whiplash traumas implies that these latter two headache types may likewise not be products of structural injuries. </p...|$|R

25|$|A single {{randomized}} controlled trial found that sumatriptan {{may help prevent}} altitude sickness. Despite their popularity, antioxidant treatments have not {{been found to be}} effective medications for prevention of AMS. Interest in phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil has been limited by the possibility that these drugs might worsen <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> of mountain sickness. A promising possible preventive for altitude sickness is myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Neuroimaging is not {{indicated}} {{for patients}} with stable headaches which are diagnosed as migraine. Studies indicate that presence of migraine does not increase a patient's risk for intracranial disease. A diagnosis of migraine which notes the absence of other problems, such as papilledema, would not indicate a need for neuroimaging. In the course of conducting a careful diagnosis, the physician should consider whether <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> has a cause other than the migraine and might require neuroimaging.|$|E

25|$|Tampico, Illinois, {{in southeastern}} Whiteside County, {{was founded in}} 1858 but {{settlers}} did not arrive in earnest until 1871, partially due to the swampy nature of the terrain. After the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad constructed a line through Tampico in 1871 growth was rapid but faced a series of major setbacks. In 1872, 1874 and 1876 the village was struck by major fires which required the repeated rebuilding of the town's central business district along Main Street. A tornado destroyed about 40 buildings in 1874, adding to <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> caused by the fires.

25|$|Just as in adults, most {{headaches}} are benign, {{but when}} head pain is accompanied with other {{symptoms such as}} speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If {{a child with a}} recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended. Guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams, confusion, seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life, change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging.|$|E

25|$|One {{recommended}} diagnostic {{approach is}} as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging {{and possibly a}} lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test {{to look for a}} brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person, a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.|$|E
500|$|Nine in {{ten people}} with sinus {{thrombosis}} have a headache; this tends to worsen {{over the period}} of several days, but may also develop suddenly (thunderclap headache). <b>The</b> <b>headache</b> {{may be the only}} symptom of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

500|$|As only 10 {{percent of}} people {{admitted}} to the emergency department with a thunderclap headache are having an SAH, other possible causes are usually considered simultaneously, such as meningitis, migraine, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Intracerebral hemorrhage, in which bleeding occurs within the brain itself, is twice as common as SAH and is often misdiagnosed as the latter. It {{is not unusual for}} SAH to be initially misdiagnosed as a migraine or tension headache, which can lead to a delay in obtaining a CT scan. In a 2004 study, this occurred in 12 percent of all cases and was more likely in people who had smaller hemorrhages and no impairment in their mental status. The delay in diagnosis led to a worse outcome. In some people, <b>the</b> <b>headache</b> resolves by itself, and no other symptoms are present. This type of headache is referred to as [...] "sentinel headache", because it is presumed to result from a small leak (a [...] "warning leak") from an aneurysm. A sentinel headache still warrants investigations with CT scan and lumbar puncture, as further bleeding may occur in the subsequent three weeks.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{case of a}} {{man with}} a 34 year history of episodic cluster {{headaches}} is described.
