2500|$|Once, {{when another}} colleague, Harlan Fiske Stone, remarked to him of an attorney's brief: [...] "That was the dullest {{argument}} I ever heard in my life," [...] McReynolds replied: [...] "The only duller thing I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> {{to hear you}} read one of your opinions." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Anytime I'm onstage or {{watching}} the music video, {{the first thing}} that comes into my mind is the person I wrote the song about.

2500|$|After {{the tour}} of South Africa, Wilkinson's 1939 season was disappointing. A hand injury {{prevented}} him from playing {{early on in the}} season. He finished the year with 63wickets at an average of 30.85, although he did manage career best figures of 8/53 against Hampshire in May 1939. Talking about why he thought he hadn't matched his success from the previous year, Wilkinson said [...] "I don't know why but nothing really went right. The only thing I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> that I tried to be too perfect, particularly with the googly. I had an England cap and as an England player I had to be good".|$|E
2500|$|Silva {{asked him}} where he shot the picture and was looking around to take the photo too. Carter pointed to a place [...] away. Then Carter {{told him that he}} had chasing the vulture away. He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, and all I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> Megan". Megan was his young daughter. He lit a cigarette and became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait to hug her when I get home." [...] A few minutes later they got into the small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{penultimate}} {{debate on}} August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over {{the actions of}} the Chicago Police Department and the protesters at the ongoing convention. In reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a Viet Cong flag, moderator Howard K. Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response. Vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit, whereupon Buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views, noting that in the U.S. during the Second World War [...] "some people were pro-Nazi and they were well treated by those who ostracized them—and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you [...] don't care because you have no sense of identification with—". Vidal then interjected that [...] "the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> yourself," [...] whereupon Smith interjected, [...] "Now let's not call names." [...] Buckley, visibly angered, rose several inches from his seat and replied, [...] "Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered." [...] Buckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a [...] "queer" [...] in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context, but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an [...] "evangelist for bisexuality": [...] "The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is {{not to be confused with}} the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher." [...] The debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary Best of Enemies.|$|E
