40|$|Summary: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of methimazole {{treatment}} on the body weight and thyroid gland structure in rats. Methimazole given as 0. 02 % solution in drinking water for three weeks induced significant decline in T 4 and T 3 levels, as determined by radioimmunoassay. The body weight gain was lowered compared to control animals, while thyroid weight was increased. Histological examination of the thyroid gland revealed a pronounced growth activation of the follicular epithelial component with frequent mitoses, accompanied with improved vascularisation. We assumed that the lower body weight gain despite decreased basal metabolic rate and similar food ingestion can be a result of brown adipose tissue activity.

40|$|Background: Pigmented paraganglioma is {{a special}} type of paraganglioma, and it is rare in the thyroid. Case Presentation: We report {{a case of a}} 41 -year-old woman who had complained of a mass in the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> <b>Histology</b> {{revealed}} tumor cells arranged in a nest-like or organoid pattern, separated by delicate fibrovascular septa. Two distinct components were observed. In the first, which constituted the majority of the tumor cells, no pigments were observed. In the second, a few cells with pigment showed intercellular substance, but the structure was unclear. Using immunohistochemistry, cells in the first component were confirmed to be diffuse strong positive for synaptophysin, but negative for chromogranin A, pan-cytokeratin, calcitonin, and thyroglobulin. About 1 % of tumor cells were stained by Ki- 67. In the margins of the tumor, a few cells were observed to be positive for HMB- 45 and Melan A after bleaching by oxalic acid. The stromal cells were positive for S- 100. Using electron microscopy, a few cells containing many round melanin bodies with greater electron density granules of nonuniform size were observed. The diagnosis of primary melanotic paraganglioma of the thyroid gland was made. Conclusion: Primary melanotic paraganglioma of the thyroid gland is a rare, low malignant potential tumor.

40|$|During {{embryonic}} development, {{organisms are}} sensitive to changes in thyroid hormone signaling which can reset the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. It has been hypothesized that this developmental programming is a ‘predictive adaptive response’, a physiological adjustment {{in accordance with the}} embryonic environment that will best aid an individual’s survival in a similar postnatal environment. When the embryonic environment is a poor predictor of the external environment, the developmental changes are no longer adaptive and can result in disease states. We predicted that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmentally-based iodide imbalance could lead to developmental changes to the thyroid axis. To explore whether iodide or EDCs could alter developmental programming, we collected American alligator eggs from an estuarine environment with high iodide availability and elevated thyroid-specific EDCs, a freshwater environment contaminated with elevated agriculturally derived EDCs, and a reference freshwater environment. We then incubated them under identical conditions. We examined plasma thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations, <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> <b>histology,</b> plasma inorganic iodide, and somatic growth at one week (before external nutrition) and ten months after hatching (on identical diets). Neonates from the estuarine environment were thyrotoxic, expressing follicular cell hyperplasia (p = 0. 01) and elevated plasma triiodothyronine concentrations (p = 0. 0006) closely tied to plasma iodide concentrations (p = 0. 003).

40|$|Introduction. Lingual <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> {{is a rare}} anomaly of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> development, {{occurring}} {{more frequently}} in females. If it causes local symptomatology such as dysphagia, dysphonia or dyspnea it is diagnosed in childhood, however, if it is asymptomatic it is usually diagnosed in adulthood. Case Outline. We present a 23 -year-old female patient in whom we diagnosed lingual <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> coincidentally during diagnostic procedures of a concomitant disease. The application of 131 I scintigraphy showed an oval field of intensive accumulation of radio markers in the zone of medial face line, around tongue base, with the absence of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> in its physiological position. Functional testing proved primary hypothyroidism and we started the application of substitution therapy. The application of levothyroxine resulted in reaching euthyroid state and the reduction of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> size. Conclusion. We present a very rare anomaly of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> and so far {{there have been no}} clear attitudes about further treatment.

40|$|Objective-To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} ultrasonography for <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> assessment in healthy Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), describe the ultrasonographic appearance of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and adjacent anatomic structures, and identify potential associations between variations in <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> morphology and demographic features in this species. Animals- 18 captive Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. Procedures- 1, 404 ultrasonographic examinations of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and adjacent anatomic structures (eg, cervical lymph nodes, musculature, and vasculature) were performed during the > 3 -year study period. Shape, echogenicity, and homogeneity of <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were assessed, and glands were categorized into morphological configurations {{on the basis of}} results of 2 -D and 3 -D ultrasonographic evaluation. Associations between demographic factors and <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> morphology were assessed. Results-Thyroid lobes appeared elliptical or fusiform in the transverse scan plane and round to oval in longitudinal scan planes; morphologically, glands comprised 2 lobes joined by an isthmus or a roughly diamond-shaped structure located on the ventral surface of the trachea. Major blood vessels and cervical lymph nodes were identified. Thyroid parenchyma was typically uniform and homogeneous, with echogenic reticulations and well-defined borders. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were hypoechoic or isoechoic relative to the sternocephalicus muscle; echogenicity was greater in adolescents than in adults. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume differed between sexes, between sexually mature and immature dolphins, and among age groups and was positively correlated with body length and weight.

40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} shown the {{limitation}} of the World Health Organization (WHO) / International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency (ICCIDD) -adopted <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume references as universal normative values for <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume. So we decided to measure <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume by sonography in schoolchildren in Rasht, Gilan Province, Iran - Rasht is a metropolitan city on the Caspian Sea coast - and compare them to WHO normative values. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 2, 522 schoolchildren, aged 6 - 13 years, in Rasht, Gilan Province, Iran were selected by multistage random sampling. Data were collected on their age, sex, weight, height, body surface area (BSA), and <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> size by palpation and sonography. The terminal phalange of thumb finger volume was calculated with the same formula used in sonography, for the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> in 1, 085 of these cases. Results: Goiter prevalence was 64 % (1613 cases) by palpation, 76. 1 % (1228 subjects) grade I and 23. 9 % (385 cases) grade II. The mean <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume in girls was more than boys (3. 67 ± 1. 89 mL vs 3. 41 ± 1. 58 mL, P < 0. 0001). According to the 1997 WHO <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume reference, none of the children had goiter based on BSA and age even in those with grade II goiters (23. 9 %). In contrast, the median <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume in our cases was larger than the 2004 WHO reference. The best single predictor of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume was age (R 2 = 0. 391, P < 0. 0001) followed by BSA (R 2 = 0. 151, P < 0. 0001). There was also {{a significant difference between}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and finger volume in all grades of goiter and grade II goiters (3 ± 1. 4 mL vs 9. 59 ± 2. 4 mL; P < 0. 0001. 4. 3 ± 1. 4 mL vs 9. 3 ± 2. 5 mL; P < 0. 0001).

The metric study indicated a mean distance from the ELN to the superior pole of a normal sized <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> of 5. 76 mm (range: 2. 00 - 11. 26) on the right, and 6. 17 mm (range: 2. 78 - 13. 48) on the left. From the literature, it is clear that the ELN may even be closer to the superior pole of an enlarged <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> The recommendation to stay on the substance of the superior pole of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> when ligating the STA remains valid, as the nerve is extremely close in relation to the superior pole of the normal <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> maintains {{basal metabolism}} in tissues for optimal function. Determining thyroid volume {{is important in}} assessing growth and involution. Volume estimation is also important in stereological studies. Direct measurements of colloid volume and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of the follicular cells may provide important information about <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> function such as hormone storage and secretion, which helps understand the changes at morphological and functional levels. The present study determined the colloid volume using simple stereological principle and the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of 4 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins and 2 human <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> In both dolphin and human <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands,</b> {{the size of the}} follicles tended to be quite variable. The distribution of large and small follicles within the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> was also found to be random in both the dolphin and human thyroid gland; however, the size of follicles appeared to decrease as a function of increasing age in the dolphin <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> The mean colloid volume of the dolphin <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and human <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> was 1. 22 × 10 (5) µm(3) and 7. 02 × 10 (5) µm(3) respectively. The dolphin and human subjects had {{a significant difference in the}} mean colloid volume. The mean N/C ratio of the dolphin thyroid follicular epithelia and human follicular epithelia was 0. 50 and 0. 64 respectively. The dolphin and human subjects had a significant difference in the mean N/C ratio. This information contributes to understanding dolphin thyroid physiology and its structural adaptations to meet the physical demands of the aquatic environment, and aids with ultrasonography and corrective therapy in live subjects...|$|R
