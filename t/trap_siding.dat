40|$|Practical {{techniques}} {{are required to}} monitor invasive animals, which are often cryptic and occur at low density. Camera traps have potential for this purpose, but may have problems detecting and identifying small species. A further challenge is how to standardise the size of each camera's field of view so capture rates are comparable between different places and times. We investigated the optimal specifications for a low-cost camera trap for small mammals. The factors tested were 1) trigger speed, 2) passive infrared vs. microwave sensor, 3) white vs. infrared flash, and 4) still photographs vs. video. We also tested {{a new approach to}} standardise each camera's field of view. We compared the success rates of four camera trap designs in detecting and taking recognisable photographs of captive stoats (Mustelaerminea), feral cats (Felis catus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceuseuropaeus). Trigger speeds of 0. 2 - 2. 1 s captured photographs of all three target species unless the animal was running at high speed. The camera with a microwave sensor was prone to false triggers, and often failed to trigger when an animal moved in front of it. A white flash produced photographs that were more readily identified to species than those obtained under infrared light. However, a white flash {{may be more likely to}} frighten target animals, potentially affecting detection probabilities. Video footage achieved similar success rates to still cameras but required more processing time and computer memory. Placing two camera <b>traps</b> <b>side</b> by side achieved a higher success rate than using a single camera. Camera traps show considerable promise for monitoring invasive mammal control operations. Further research should address how best to standardise the size of each camera's field of view, maximise the probability that an animal encountering a camera trap will be detected, and eliminate visible or audible cues emitted by camera traps...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{a highly}} {{reactive}} prepreg {{system should be}} used to reach a fast crosslinking of the resin. Besides the material formulation, the reactivity can also be influenced by the processing prior and within the autoclave. Prior to the autoclave, the prepreg should be stored at low temperatures, {{to reduce the amount of}} side reaction due to some prepreg aging effects. Furthermore the laminate lay-up should be performed at conditions, which do not favor side reactions (such as relatively low temperature and relatively low moisture content) and the usage of in between vacuum applications of the layup will decrease the content of <b>trapped</b> interlaminar <b>side</b> reactants (e.g. <b>trapped</b> air). Within the autoclave, the amount of side reactions can be reduced by the application of a vacuum, which should be as high as possible to reduce moisture and oxygen content within the vacuum bag. In addition, the vacuum finally increases the interlaminar part quality.|$|R
50|$|At {{most times}} during a dive the Buoyancy {{compensator}} is only partially filled, {{and the air}} in it will rise to the highest part of the bladder that it can reach without having to flow downhill {{on the way to}} get there.

40|$|To {{test for}} the effects of host {{accessibility}} oil blood-feeding behavior, we assessed degrees of anthropophily of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae at two stages of the behavioral sequence of host foraging in a rice growing area near Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, where humans are not readily accessible because of years of generalized use of (mostly non-impregnated) bed nets. First, patterns of lost selection were assessed by the identification of the blood meal origin of indoor-resting samples. Inherent host preferences were then determined by two odor-baited entry <b>traps,</b> set <b>side</b> by side in a choice arrangement, releasing either human or calf odor. The proportion of feeds taken oil humans was around 40 %, whereas 88 % of trapped An. gambiae "chose" the human-baited trap, indicating a zoophilic pattern of host selection despite a stronger trap entry response with human odor. This paradox can be interpreted as the evolution of a plastic strategy of feeding behavior in this field population of An. gambiae because of the greater accessibility of readily available, although less-preferred, hosts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract An {{array of}} four {{sediment}} traps and one current meter was deployed under a well-developed platelet layer for 15 {{days in the}} Drescher Inlet in the Riiser Larsen ice shelf, in February 1998. Traps were deployed at 10 m �just under the platelet layer), 112 m �above the thermocline), 230 m �below thermocline) and 360 m �close to sea ¯oor). There was a substantial ¯ux of particulate organic material out of the platelet layer, although higher amounts were collected in the <b>traps</b> either <b>side</b> of the thermocline. Material collected was predominantly composed of faecal pellets containing diatom species growing within the platelet layer. The size classes of these pellets suggest they derive from protists grazing rather than from larger metazoans. Sediment trap material was analysed for particulate organic carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus �POC/PON/POP) and d 13 C POC �carbon isotopic composition of POC). These were compared with organic matter in the overlying platelet layer and the water column. In turn, the biogeochemistry of the platelet layer and water column was investigated and the organic matter characteristics related to inorganic nutrients �nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, silicate, phosphate), dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen �DOC/DON), pH, dissolved inorganic carbon �DIC), oxygen and d 13 C DIC �carbon isotopic composition dissolved inorganic carbon).

40|$|We {{implement}} {{and demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} a cooling scheme using a moving, all-optical, one-way barrier to cool a sample of $^{ 87 }$Rb atoms, achieving nearly a factor of 2 reduction in temperature. The one-way barrier, composed of two focused, Gaussian laser beams, allows atoms incident on one side to transmit, while reflecting atoms incident on the other. The one-way barrier is adiabatically swept through a sample of atoms contained in a far-off-resonant, single-beam, optical dipole trap that forms a nearly harmonic trapping potential. As the barrier moves longitudinally through the potential, atoms become <b>trapped</b> to one <b>side</b> of the barrier with reduced kinetic energy. The adiabatic translation of the barrier leaves the atoms {{at the bottom of the}} trapping potential, only minimally increasing their kinetic energy...|$|R
50|$|The ninth {{hole at the}} Yale {{golf course}} is the course's {{signature}} hole, world famous due to an unusual 65 yd deep green with an 8 ft depression separating front and back and a difficult tee shot requiring both distance and precision. This Biarritz Green is considered {{by some to be}} the best example of this type of hole in the world. It overlooks a lake with woods at both sides, requiring a straight shot with at least a 190 yd carry to reach the green. If the ball reaches the depression the player faces an extremely difficult two putt; therefore to shoot par the tee shot must land on the correct area of the green near the pin, either front or back. The <b>trap</b> to the <b>side</b> of the green also leaves a tricky up and down.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} hybrid optomechanical scheme to achieve {{dynamical}} squeezing of position quadrature of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator, {{that can be}} externally controlled by classical fields. A membrane-in-the-middle set up is employed, in which an atom in Λ configuration {{is considered to be}} <b>trapped</b> on either <b>side</b> of the membrane inside the cavity. We show that a considerable amount of squeezing (beyond the 3 dB limit) can be achieved that is not affected by the decay of the cavity and the spontaneous emission of the atom. Squeezing depends upon the initial preparation of atomic states. Further, a strong effective coupling between the atom and the oscillator can be attained by using large control fields that pump the atom and the cavity. Effect of thermal phononic bath on squeezing is studied in terms of the squeezing spectrum. The results are supported by the detailed analytical calculations. Comment: 5 figures, 6 page...|$|R

The use of Shannon traps may provide information on the anthropophily of the species and improve the traps’ performance in terms of diversity and quantity of insects collected when white and black colored traps are used together. This study sought to verify the attractiveness of the traps to the phlebotomine species of the Brazilian Amazon basin using Shannon traps under these conditions. The insects were collected using two Shannon <b>traps</b> installed <b>side</b> by side, one white and the other black, in a primary forest area of the municipality of Xapuri, Acre, Brazil. Samples were collected once a month during the period August 2013 to July 2015. A sample of females was dissected to test for natural infection by flagellates. A total of 6, 309 (864 males and 5, 445 females) specimens (36 species) were collected. Psychodopygus carrerai carrerai (42 %), Nyssomyia shawi (36 %), and Psychodopygus davisi (13 %), together represented 90 % of the insects collected. Nyssomyia shawi and Psychodopygus davisi were more attracted by the white color. Specimens of Nyssomyia shawi, Nyssomyia whitmani, and Psychodopygus hirsutus hirsutus were found naturally infected by flagellates in the mid and hindgut.

40|$|ABSTRACT Paired trap {{lines of}} Þve boll weevil {{pheromone}} traps each {{were placed on}} opposite sides of a brush line at six different sites on a plantation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Temperature, wind speed, and wind direction were monitored with a nearby weather station. We observed a strong negative relationship between mean daily wind speed and total daily capture of boll weevils. About half of the day-to-day variation in weevil captures was explained by wind speed alone. In addition, our data indicate that much of the variation between traps within days may arise from differences in local wind speed as governed by local vegetation depending on wind direction. Brush lines in this study slowed the wind by 40 — 70 % and mitigated its effects such that traps on the leeward side averaged 2. 5 — 2. 9 times higher captures than <b>traps</b> on thewindward <b>side.</b> Themagnitude of the effect ofwindward or leeward placement of traps onweevil captures depended on the relativ...|$|R
