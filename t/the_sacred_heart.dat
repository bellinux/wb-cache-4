The destruction of the city followed a protracted two year siege, with the armies surrounding the city and restricting the flow {{of food and water}} into Jerusalem. Famine spread, and death was rife. When Jerusalem was finally conquered, the Babylonians destroyed the entire fabric of Judean society. People were killed, buildings were destroyed, the king, the leaders and all but the poorest members of society were exiled. <b>The</b> Temple, <b>the</b> <b>sacred</b> centre <b>heart</b> of <b>the</b> nation, was levelled and its treasures carried off by the victorious army.
