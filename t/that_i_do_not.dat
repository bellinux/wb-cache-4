For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
25|$|Merleau-Ponty {{demonstrates}} a corporeity of consciousness {{as much as}} an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar as I have hands, feet; a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> choose” (1962, p.440).|$|E

500|$|The boy was baptised at the Church of St Nicolas, Guildford, and {{was named}} after his godfather, Pelham von Donop. Wodehouse wrote in 1957, [...] "If you ask {{me to tell you}} frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, I must confess <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not....</b> I was named after a godfather, and not a thing to show for it but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897." [...] The first name was rapidly elided to [...] "Plum", the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.|$|E
500|$|The {{cry of the}} {{condemned}} men was {{the inspiration for the}} song [...] "God Save Ireland", which became Ireland's unofficial national anthem until officially replaced by [...] "Amhrán na bhFiann" [...] ("The Soldier's Song"). The executions were also [...] "incalculable" [...] in their influence on the [...] "political awakening" [...] of Charles Stewart Parnell. Speaking in the House of Commons ten years later, Parnell told the House: [...] "I wish to say as directly as I can <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe, and never shall believe, that any murder was committed in Manchester." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} church Keable and Sybil {{moved back to}} England, {{settling}} at West Wratting, Cambridgeshire, where both began to explore the Roman Catholic Church. Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. What is behind it, I don't know. But I'm inclined to think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe it is anything which the old concept of God really covers." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the opening}} of Johor's 12th State Assembly in June 2008, Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island [...] "whatever it takes". Speaking impromptu {{at the end of}} a {{prepared}} speech, the Sultan said in Malay: [...] "Let us be reminded <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> forget Pulau Batu Puteh. Pulau Batu Puteh is not Singapore's, but it belongs to Johor. It does not matter how long it may take, I will find the way to get back the island, which belongs to Johor." [...] The Menteri Besar of Johor said the state government had [...] "clearly heard" [...] what the Sultan said, but did not elaborate.|$|E
500|$|By early 1868, the U.S. {{government}} desired {{a peaceful}} settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's {{demands that the}} US abandon forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith. Gall of the Hunkpapa (among other representatives of the Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, and Yankton Dakota) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota). Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him out {{on behalf of the}} government: [...] “I wish all to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> propose to sell any part of part of my country.” He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.|$|E

500|$|Lady Charlotte Finch's {{career as}} royal governess began in August 1762, {{when she was}} {{appointed}} {{a day after the}} birth of George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son and heir of King George III and Queen Charlotte. Walpole called the decision [...] "a choice so universally approved <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think she will be abused even in the North Briton". Finch's biographer, Jill Shefrin, writes that the governess was noted for the skill she devoted to the raising of her own children, while Christopher Hibbert suggests that her educated background made her [...] "well-suited" [...] to the position. Lady Charlotte held the role of royal governess for over 30 years, and oversaw 14 of the king and queen's 15 children. She presided over the royal nursery, overseeing the staff members designated for each child; the staff included sub-governesses, teachers, personal attendants, and assistant governesses. She oversaw the princes until they became old enough to live in their own households, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21.|$|E
500|$|Hannah Montana {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who appreciated its overall production. Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares enjoyed Cyrus' deliveries of [...] "cute, well-written songs", {{and added that}} the overall project was [...] "sweet, starry-eyed, [...] utterly charming". Jennifer Axman from Common Sense Media shared a similar sentiment, appreciating its [...] "upbeat girl-power messages" [...] and distinguishing [...] "I Learned from You" [...] as a stand-out track for its inspirational lyrics ("I learned from you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> crumble / I learned from you that strength is something you choose /.../ There is no question that's a lesson I learned from you"). MSN Music gave the record a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and listed it as an [...] "essential album". However, Chris Willman provided a more mixed review, commenting that Cyrus appeared to [...] "mimic Avril, Ashlee, and Britney simultaneously", and felt {{that the concept of}} leading a double life was [...] "a nice fantasy for Brangelina, but a weird one to push on little girls." [...] David Hiltbrand was also critical of the record, stating that its [...] "generic pop" [...] would irritate adult listeners, but acknowledged that it was [...] "slickly executed" [...] for appealing to its younger audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{cancelled}} {{journey was}} the beginning of the end. A crying, defiant Bosse went off by herself to the seaside resort Hornbæk in Denmark, a much shorter trip, but to her senses, a delightfully refreshing one. [...] There, she was soon followed by Strindberg's letters, full of agonized remorse at having given her pain, and then by Strindberg himself, steeling himself to bear the social life Bosse relished. However, the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion, as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick, unable to endure any attention to Bosse. In August, when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant, even Strindberg's delight (he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation. [...] This was illustrated in Strindberg's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne-Marie was born on 25 March 1902, they were already living apart. [...] "For the sake of us both it is best <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> return", wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg. [...] "A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word, every act of mine, would be the end of me." [...] At her insistence, Strindberg began divorce proceedings.|$|E

5000|$|Angered by Olson's {{announcement}} {{that she had}} lied in court, Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler ordered another hearing on November 6, at which he asked her several times if she was indeed guilty of the charges.
