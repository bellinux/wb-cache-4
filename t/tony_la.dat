5|$|By {{reaching}} the World Series with the Cardinals, <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> Russa became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after La Russa had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 {{and winning the}} 1989 World Series. He would attempt to join Sparky Anderson as the only men to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds) and to indicate {{he was trying to}} win the team's 10th championship.|$|E
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> Russa finished with identical 104–58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season.|$|E
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E

5|$|Since their 1882 establishment, the St. Louis Cardinals, {{originally}} {{known as}} the St. Louis Browns, have employed 63 managers. Ned Cuthbert was the franchise's original manager, and Mike Matheny is the team's current skipper. <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> Russa leads the team in regular-season and postseason wins (1,231 and 33), regular-season and postseason losses (1,029 and 25), and playoff appearances (7). La Russa and Hall of Famer Billy Southworth won two World Series, tied for the most in club history by a single manager. Charles Comiskey leads the team in winning percentage (.685), {{and is one of}} thirteen Cardinals managers who have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame—three of whom (Comiskey, Southworth, Red Schoendienst) had multiple tenures with the club. La Russa and Whitey Herzog each won a Manager of the Year award with the Cardinals—Herzog in 1985 and La Russa in 2002, the fourth of his career.|$|E
5|$|The Manager of the Year Award is {{an honor}} given {{annually}} since 1983 to the best managers in the American and National Leagues. The winner is voted on by 28 members of the BBWAA. Each places a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with {{the highest score in}} each league wins the award. In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> Russa, Lou Piniella, and Jim Leyland have since won the award in both leagues. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, {{pitching}} the Giants' home opener, Cain threw {{a complete}} game shut out, striking out 11. Facing 28 batters in 9 innings, {{one over the}} minimum, he allowed a single baserunner on a hit to James McDonald, the pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the third one-hitter of Cain's career. In his next start, on April 18, Cain threw another 9 shutout innings using only 91 pitches, dueling Cliff Lee of the Phillies who threw 102 pitches over 10 scoreless innings. The first 9 innings took only 1 hour and 49 minutes. The Giants {{went on to win}} in the 11th inning. Following a dominant first half, Cain was selected to the All-Star Game and was chosen by manager <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> Russa to be the NL's starting pitcher. On July 10 at Kauffman Stadium, Cain allowed a leadoff single to Derek Jeter before retiring the six remaining hitters he faced; he was the winning pitcher in an 8–0 decision. On July 21, Cain hit his sixth career home run, off of Phillies' pitcher Cole Hamels in the third inning of a 10-inning, 65 Giants' victory. Later in that inning Hamels hit his first career home run off of Cain, making this the first time since 2002 when two pitchers have homered off of each other in the same game (Kevin Millwood and Denny Stark were the last to do it).|$|E

25|$|On August 9, 2007, the Cardinals {{promoted}} Ankiel from Memphis after {{a roster}} spot was vacated by Scott Spiezio's departure. In his first game, Ankiel batted second and played right field. In his first at bat, {{he received a}} prolonged standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd. During the seventh inning, he hit a three-run home run off Doug Brocail to right field to help the Cardinals defeat the San Diego Padres, 5–0. It was his first {{home run in the}} majors since April 2000 (as a pitcher), and made him the first player since Clint Hartung (1947) to hit his first major league home run as a pitcher and then hit a home run as a position player. The player before Hartung who accomplished this was Babe Ruth. After the game, <b>Tony</b> <b>La</b> Russa said that his only happier moment as a Cardinal was when they won the 2006 World Series. Two days later, against the Dodgers on August 11, Ankiel drew three standing ovations. He had three hits, including two home runs and three RBIs and made a spectacular catch in right field.|$|E
