5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>broth.</b> By boiling <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within <b>the</b> <b>broth.</b> Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 the Norwegian {{pathologist}} Leiv Kreyberg {{was allowed}} to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under a microscope. Kreyberg wrote that <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> Reich had used as his culture medium was indeed sterile, but that the bacteria were ordinary staphylococci. He concluded that Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.|$|E
25|$|The Polish {{chicken soup}} is called rosół. It is {{commonly}} served with fine noodles, boiled carrots and sometimes parsley. <b>The</b> <b>broth</b> is served separate from chicken meat.|$|E
30|$|The {{content and}} {{composition}} of proteins in <b>the</b> extracellular <b>broth</b> extracted from <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> and mature cells were detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Qu and Zhu 2016). The results showed nearly no protein bands in <b>the</b> extracellular <b>broth</b> of <b>the</b> conventional batch culture (Fig.  5 c, line 1), while certain amount of intracellular proteins with obvious bands were extracted when the nonionic surfactant TX was added to <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> or mature cells (Fig.  5 c, lines 2 and 3). These protein bands extracted from <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> or within mature cells were basically the same. As the pigment components extracted from <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> and mature cells were also remained unchanged (Fig.  5 a, b), it could be induced that the transformation of pigment components in the extractive cultivation might be catalyzed by the intracellular enzymes that were relating to pigment conversion.|$|R
30|$|The {{removal of}} butanol or ABE from <b>the</b> {{fermentation}} <b>broth</b> by liquid–liquid extraction {{is considered an}} important technique. Usually, a water-insoluble organic extractant is mixed with <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth.</b> <b>The</b> main problem concerned {{with the use of}} this technique is related to the toxicity of the solvent to the cells [79]. The major limitation is that the extractant with high partition coefficient often leads to microbial toxicity because of direct contact between <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> and <b>the</b> extractant [80].|$|R

25|$|Chicken stew {{is a more}} {{substantial}} dish with a higher ratio of solids to broth. <b>The</b> <b>broth</b> may also be thickened toward a gravy-like consistency with a roux or by adding flour-based dumplings (matzah balls {{do not have the}} same thickening effect).|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{chicken soup}} is often served with pasta, in such dishes as cappelletti in brodo, {{tortellini}} in brodo and passatelli. Even when served on its own, {{the meat and}} any vegetables used are usually removed from <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> {{and served as a}} second dish.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>broth</b> for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. <b>The</b> <b>broth</b> takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E
30|$|A fine {{touch of}} B. licheniformis SHG 10 {{preserved}} on PA slant was streaked on PA agar and was incubated at 37 °C for overnight. One colony was picked to inoculate 20  ml of PY medium in 100  ml Erlenmeyer flask. <b>The</b> inoculated <b>broth</b> was incubated at 37 °C with agitation speed of 200  rpm for 4  hrs until the culture OD at 420  nm reached 0.5. Then this growing culture (seed broth) {{was used to}} inoculate <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> (production medium). <b>The</b> inoculum size of <b>the</b> seed <b>broth</b> used to inoculate <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> was 2 %(v/v) unless otherwise stated.|$|R
30|$|The CITSens Bio-sensor {{has been}} {{developed}} to monitor glucose and lactic acid in <b>the</b> culture <b>broth.</b> <b>The</b> device uses enzymatic sensors integrated into a non-breathable cap instead of breathable culture plugs (Bauer et al. 2012). However, this method does not allow the monitoring of environmental factors in <b>the</b> culture <b>broth</b> during shake-flask culture using Erlenmeyer flasks with culture plugs.|$|R
50|$|Cefoxitin, and the cephamycin {{family as}} a whole, served as a {{branching}} point and impulsed the discovery of more classes of beta-lactams. This is {{in part due to}} their primary and early discovery in <b>the</b> <b>broths</b> studied.|$|R
25|$|Hot noodles {{are usually}} {{served in a}} bowl already steeped in their broth and are called kakesoba or kakeudon. Cold soba arrive unseasoned and heaped atop a zaru or seiro, and are picked up with a chopstick and dunked in their dip sauce. <b>The</b> <b>broth</b> is a soy-dashi-mirin type of mix; the dip is similar but more {{concentrated}} (heavier on soy sauce).|$|E
25|$|Kayu may be {{made with}} just rice and water, and is often {{seasoned}} with salt. Eggs can be beaten into it to thicken it into gruel. Toppings may be added to enhance flavour; Welsh onion, salmon, roe, ginger, and umeboshi (pickled ume fruit) {{are among the most}} common. Miso or chicken stock may be used to flavor <b>the</b> <b>broth.</b> Most Japanese electric rice cookers have a specific setting for cooking congee.|$|E
25|$|Pho {{is served}} in a bowl with a {{specific}} cut of white rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket). Variations feature tendon, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> is made using only chicken bones and meat, {{as well as some}} internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs and the gizzard.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of enrichment broths for recovery of Campylobacter jejuni from food by the methods of Doyle and Roman (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 43 : 1343 - 1353) and of Park et al. (Can. J. Microbiol. 27 : 841 - 842). No {{significant differences were found}} between the results obtained with <b>the</b> two <b>broths.</b> Recovery was greater, however, with a constant gas flow into <b>the</b> <b>broths</b> than with an evacuation-replacement method...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the following methods for determining nitrate utilization: Wickerham broth, a special nitrate broth, Delft plate, and nitrate strip. With 236 isolates of cryptococci as test organisms, <b>the</b> special nitrate <b>broth</b> method gave 99 % correct results and <b>the</b> Wickerham <b>broth</b> method gave 98 %. The nitrate strip and Delft plate methods gave correct results in 94 and 86 % of tests, respectively. <b>The</b> special nitrate <b>broth</b> method is judged superior {{because it provides}} accurate results within 48 h, compared to 14 days with <b>the</b> Wickerham <b>broth</b> method...|$|R
25|$|The exact origin is unknown, {{but many}} {{believe it was}} created by Italian {{immigrants}} who worked for Chicago's old Union Stock Yards in the early 1900s. They often would bring home some of the tougher, less desirable cuts of beef sold by the company. To make the meat more palatable, it was slow-roasted {{to make it more}} tender, then slow-simmered in a spicy broth for flavor. Both the roasting and <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> used Italian-style spices and herbs. The meat was then thinly sliced across the grain and stuffed into fresh Italian bread.|$|E
25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very {{much a matter of}} the region and the cook's taste.|$|E
25|$|Another Shabbat dish is calf's foot jelly, called p'tsha or šaltiena in Lithuania and galarita, galer, galleh, or fisnoge in Poland. Beef or calf {{bones are}} put up to boil with water, seasonings, garlic and onions {{for a long}} time. It is then allowed to cool. <b>The</b> <b>broth</b> then jells into a {{semi-solid}} mass, which is served in cubes. Drelies, a similar dish originating in south Russia and Galicia is mixed with soft-boiled eggs and vinegar when removed from the oven, and served hot. In Romania it is called piftie, in Serbia pihtije; it is served cold, with garlic, hard boiled eggs and vinegar sauce or mustard creme and considered a traditional dish in the winter season.|$|E
30|$|The {{level of}} pecic {{oligosaccharides}} accumulated in <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> of this bioprocess was estimated. It {{was found to}} be 200  μg galacturonic acid/mL of fermentation broth after 24  hrs. No higher levels of these substances were found in <b>the</b> fermentation <b>broth</b> beyond 24  hrs of incubation.|$|R
50|$|In 1745, John Needham {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments on boiled broths. Believing that boiling would kill all living things, he showed that when sealed right after boiling, <b>the</b> <b>broths</b> would cloud, allowing the belief in spontaneous generation to persist. His studies were rigorously scrutinized by his peers {{and many of them}} agreed.|$|R
40|$|A cefoxitin-based {{selective}} broth {{was evaluated}} for its efficiency in detecting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{by the use}} of laboratory reference strains, clinical isolates of different clones, and clinical samples. <b>The</b> cefoxitin-based <b>broth</b> was proved to be more sensitive and rapid for the detection of MRSA strains, especially heterogeneously resistant strains, than <b>the</b> oxacillin-based <b>broth...</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite its humble ubiquity {{among the}} poor, {{it is also}} popular as a main entrée when cooked {{with a variety of}} meats. For example, cháo gà is cooked with chicken, garlic, and ginger. The rice {{porridge}} is cooked in <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> in which a whole chicken had been boiled, and once the chicken is cooked, the meat is sliced and layered on a bed of shredded raw cabbage and sliced scallions and drizzled with a vinegar-based sauce, to be eaten as a side dish to the porridge. Other combinations include cháo vịt (duck porridge), which is cooked in the same fashion as the chicken porridge, but with duck. Cháo lòng heo is made with lòng heo, a variety of offal from pork or duck with sliced portions of congealed pork blood. Cháo is typically served with quẩy on the side.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>broth</b> for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in <b>the</b> <b>broth,</b> typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{fermentation}} <b>broth</b> {{after culture}} was filtered through a 0.8  mm mixed cellulose esters membrane. <b>The</b> filtrate (extracellular <b>broth)</b> was appropriately diluted {{to determine the}} residual glucose concentration. The residual glucose was quantified by the standard 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method. The mycelia were filtered from <b>the</b> culture <b>broth,</b> subjected to washing 3 times with distilled water and dried at 60  °C {{in the oven for}} at least overnight until a constant weight was achieved for the determination of dry cell weight (DCW) by gravity.|$|R

30|$|During {{biosynthesis}} of GNPs, all of {{the ultimate}} reaction solutions possessed the characteristic red color, indicating generation of GNPs which was also validated by the UV–Vis–NIR characterizations (see supporting information). Such resulting GNPs were built upon Au(III) conversion, a redox reaction depending on the properties of <b>the</b> <b>broths</b> (as <b>the</b> reaction time, temperature and pressure were fixed). Accordingly, the relevancies between the conversion of Au(III) and each parameter, e.g., original pH value, the content of flavonoids, reducing sugars and proteins, {{as well as the}} anti-oxidant capability of <b>the</b> foliar <b>broths</b> should reflect <b>the</b> role of each parameter upon the biosynthesis of GNPs, as demonstrated in the following sections.|$|R
500|$|Ro ( [...] , a broth) may {{be served}} as the main laoka or in {{addition}} to it to flavor and moisten the rice. [...] Ro-mangazafy (...) is a rich and flavorful broth made with beef, tomato and garlic that often accompanies a dry laoka. By contrast, Romatsatso (...) is a light and relatively flavorless broth made with onion, tomato and anamamy greens served with meat or fatty poultry. Ron-akoho (...) , a broth made with chicken and ginger, is a home remedy for the common cold, while rompatsa (...) —a broth made with tiny dried shrimp and beef, to which sweet potato leaves and potato are often added—is traditionally eaten by new mothers to support lactation. The national dish is <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> called romazava, which in its simplest form is made of beef with anamalao, anantsonga or anamamy, although ingredients such as tomato, onion and ginger are commonly added to create more complex and flavorful versions.

500|$|Cawl, {{pronounced}} {{in a similar}} way to the English word [...] "cowl", can be regarded as Wales' national dish. Dating back to the 11th century, originally it was a simple broth of meat (most likely bacon) and vegetables, it could be cooked slowly {{over the course of the}} day whilst the family was out working the fields. It could be made in stages, over a number of days, first by making a meat stock, then by adding the vegetables on the following day. Once cooked, the fat could be skimmed from the top of the pot, then it would be served as two separate dishes, first as a soup, then as a stew. Leftovers could be topped up with fresh vegetables, sometimes over the course of weeks. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the amount of meat used in <b>the</b> <b>broth</b> was minimal; instead it was bulked out with potatoes. Today, cawl would be much more likely to include beef or lamb for the meat, and may be served with plain oatmeal dumplings or currant dumplings known as trollies. Traditionally cawl would be eaten with a [...] "specially-carved wooden spoon" [...] and eaten from a wooden bowl.|$|E
