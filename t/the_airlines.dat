5|$|Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. <b>The</b> <b>airlines</b> {{announced}} a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions {{to operate on}} the capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held a monopoly on these routes and <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning {{more than a third}} of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 percent of the company in July 1991. At a shareholders meeting in July, Stein Øxseth was appointed chairman and all non-Norwegian board members were replaced.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} lightning strikes on aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with harnesses and platforms, this inspection usually takes about eight hours. The immobilization of the aircraft and the staff are costly for <b>the</b> <b>airlines,</b> estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>airline</b> {{was founded}} by Khalid Mehmood Sehbai who was <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> first chairman. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> is named after the Shaheen falcon, Pakistan's {{national}} bird. At first <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> introduced nationwide flights to countrywide destinations. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> introduced many different flights, but operated mainly between the Pakistani cities of Karachi and Quetta.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>airline</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} non-Aeroflot divided <b>airlines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>airline's</b> fleet {{consisted}} mostly from Tupolev Tu-154. In 2001, the contract of the operator of <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> was cancelled, which lead to the destinations ceasing, but <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> completely closed in 2002.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>airline</b> {{expanded}} throughout <b>the</b> Southeastern United States and in 1993 {{opened a}} hub in Birmingham, Alabama. From Birmingham, the company offered flights to Little Rock (AR), Mobile (AL), Atlanta (GA), Greenville (SC) and Charleston (SC). <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> connected both hubs with service via an Austin-Tyler-Little Rock-Birmingham route. In 1993 <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> had 16 aircraft and 300 employees. Afterwards <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> business declined. During {{a point in}} which <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> had about one and one half years of the abatement left, officials from <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> and <b>the</b> City of Austin acknowledged that <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> may fail as a company. In an attempt to survive, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> removed 100 employees and 10 aircraft. In 1994 Conquest's tax base was appraised at $4.7 million.|$|R
5|$|In 1989, about 5,500 {{people worked}} at Fornebu. Of these, 3,600 worked for <b>the</b> <b>airlines,</b> {{including}} ground services. The airport administration had 350 employees, including administration, air control, fire fighters, meteorology and maintenance. The remaining 500 people worked for other public offices, including {{the police and}} customs, as well as service employees working for private companies involved with passenger services.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of Concorde that <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically. A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA's resolve to continue operating Concorde.|$|E
5|$|A {{new round}} of {{concession}} applications were filed in 1987: Trondheim to Northern Norway, Tromsø–Longyearbyen, Oslo–Billund and Oslo–Alicante. The right-winged Willoch's Second Cabinet decided to use three principles in issuing new concessions: keeping the array of local routes, granting concessions on the terms that <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> would continue to cross-subsidize routes, and to introduce competition on the largest routes. Braathens SAFE was given permission to fly Oslo–Bergen and Western Norway – Trondheim – Bodø – Tromsø, plus once daily Oslo–Trondheim–Bodø, as well as Tromsø–Longyearbyen. At the same time, SAS was allowed to fly freely on the routes Oslo–Trondheim and Oslo–Stavanger. In 1988, Braathens SAFE introduced automatic check-in machines in Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, Ålesund and Trondheim.|$|E
50|$|Previously <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> {{head office}} {{was in the}} Plasa Medardo SV Thielman in Kralendijk, Bonaire. In April 2007 <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> moved its head office from Bonaire to Curaçao, where <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> flight {{operations}} have been based. <b>The</b> <b>airline's</b> call centre and its revenue accounting and handling departments remained in Bonaire.|$|R
50|$|In June 21, 2016, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> started {{flights to}} Holguín. In June 28, 2016, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> started flights to Chiclayo. In July 1, 2016, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> started flights to Rosario.|$|R
25|$|The {{first flight}} of <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> was, Dubai-Karachi on 25 October 1985. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> leased an Airbus 300B4-200, from Pakistan International Airlines. Bombay and Delhi were the next {{destinations}} for <b>the</b> <b>airline.</b>|$|R
5|$|According to a People {{magazine}} {{profile of}} McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from {{the owners of}} 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The Sands Directory indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.|$|E
5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> {{had agreed to}} fly to {{unprofitable}} airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E
5|$|During the {{negotiations}} to create OSAS, <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> quickly {{agreed that they}} would need a common profile and naming style. Referencing Vikings allowed the airline to play on a common history between the Scandinavian countries, while giving a global distinctive and recognizable mark. The aircraft were painted with a livery consisting of a dragon's head, iconic of the Viking longships, in combination with a cheatline which intersected with the windows such as to visualize the shields hung {{on the side of}} the longships.|$|E
50|$|On March 2, 2007 <b>the</b> local <b>Airline's</b> FSDO office, FAA {{officials}} in DC, and <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> {{got into a}} disagreement over wording in <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> training manuals. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> voluntarily ceased scheduled operations until the items could be clarified. FAA officials found no discrepancies when they went over all pilots records. In the end, about 35 of <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> flights were canceled that Saturday.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>airline</b> was {{established}} in February 1994 as QuikAire Cargo Inc. Dan Rocheleau, Founder and President of <b>the</b> <b>airline,</b> started <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> using <b>the</b> Cessna C208 Caravan to meet a specialized demand in the Canadian short-haul air cargo market and several C208B Grand Caravans and Super Cargomasters are in use by <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> today.|$|R
50|$|Girma joined Ethiopian Airlines {{upon his}} {{graduation}} in 1965. At <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> {{was dominated by}} Americans, primarily from TWA, which had assisted in <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> development. Girma {{was one of the}} first Ethiopians to rise in <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> executive hierarchy. Girma stayed at <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> for nearly three decades, until debates in 1993 between the new Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front government and <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> leadership led to several resignations, including that of Girma.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} {{that it was going to}} reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Drukair {{introduced}} a new uniform for its flight attendants, consisting of a contemporary kira and tego. The uniforms were introduced for the centenary celebrations of the monarchy, as well as <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> own silver jubilee. The uniform was chosen {{by way of a}} competition in which five Bhutanese fashion designers submitted entries, with the winner receiving a BTN 75,000 prize. The textiles used in the new uniform were chosen via a competition which was jointly organised by Drukair and the United Nations Development Programme to promote the Bhutanese textile industry and culture.|$|E
5|$|In October 1999, Chakrapong founded Royal Phnom Penh Airways. Chakrapong raised US$2 {{million from}} {{personal}} savings and bank loans, {{which he used}} to acquire one 52-seater Antonov-24 and another 100-seater Yakovlev Yak-42 airplanes. <b>The</b> <b>airlines</b> flew domestic routes within {{the first year of}} operations and most of its customers were Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese tourists. By May 2001, Royal Phnom Penh Airways secured three authorizations to fly between Phnom PenhBangkok, Phnom PenhHo Chi Minh City as well as Ho Chi Minh CitySiem Reap. <b>The</b> <b>airlines</b> attempted to secure two additional routes from the Cambodian government—Bangkok-Siem Reap in August 2001 and Siem Reap-Bangkok in August 2002—but lost both bids to other airlines. Chakrapong accused the government political bias in awarding the deals due to his political affiliations. In October 2003, the director of Battambang Airport, Prum Chantha, reported that Royal Phnom Penh Airways had accumulated $1million in unpaid taxes. Chakrapong suspended domestic flights between Phnom Penh and Battambang as foreign tourists opted for land transport options to provincial capitals which were cheaper than air transport. Royal Phnom Penh Airways had already become bankrupt by March 2006 when the government presented Chakrapong a bill of $1.36 million in unpaid taxes, navigation, and landing fees. When Chakrapong failed to repay the taxes to the government, Hun Sen issued a lawsuit in March 2007 against him.|$|E
5000|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> {{was not in}} good {{financial}} shape at that time. Like much of <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> industry, Alaska Airlines was {{hit with}} rising fuel and operating costs {{and was on the}} verge of bankruptcy. Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was delayed. <b>The</b> <b>airline's</b> cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a Boeing 727-100 jetliner crashed on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America's worst single-plane crash at the time. Because <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> was struggling financially, <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> board ousted <b>the</b> president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> was [...] million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. <b>The</b> <b>airline's</b> cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> tarnished image of [...] "Elastic Airlines." [...] The logo was changed to an image of a smiling Eskimo, which remains today. As a result of these efforts, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.|$|R
50|$|The {{turning point}} for <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> was in 1994 when Pádraig Ó Céidigh and Eugene O'Kelly {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>airline.</b> Ó Céidigh and O'Kelly began to expand <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> routes and fleet, launching scheduled services in 1998. Also in 1998, the Irish government awarded <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> <b>the</b> Public service obligation (PSO) route between Donegal Airport and Dublin Airport followed by the PSO route between Sligo Airport and Dublin.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>airline</b> was {{incorporated}} on 29 July 1993. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> started service on 23 October 1995. Two Shorts 360 aircraft were acquired {{from one of}} <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> major shareholder, Mesa Airlines, a United States commuter airline.|$|R
5|$|Oslo Airport, Gardermoen {{opened on}} 8 October 1998, {{replacing}} the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Trondheim using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. SAS and Braathens {{also saw the}} opportunity to increase the frequency on the route, and the three airlines between them introduced 39 daily flights. This made the route the fourth-busiest in Europe {{in terms of the}} number of aircraft. During this period, there were 84 daily departures to all destinations from Værnes. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> NOK 3 billion.|$|E
5|$|The nearest airport {{which serve}} {{the city is}} the Sultan Mahmud Airport (IATA: TGG, ICAO: WMKN) serving {{domestic}} and international routes located in the neighboring Kuala Nerus District. <b>The</b> <b>airlines</b> serving this airport are Malaysia Airlines, Firefly, AirAsia, and Malindo Air. Until December 2014, the airport was connected by 5 cities which operated daily and weekly flights from/to Kuala Lumpur–International, Kuala Lumpur-Subang, Medan, Miri, and Singapore. Malaysia Airlines also brings passengers to Mecca via Jeddah and Medina during the hajj season. In 2013, the airport handled 699,310 passengers with 11,402 aircraft movements. The terminal was designed to handle 2 million passengers every year.|$|E
5|$|After {{testing the}} engine for several years, {{both in the}} air and on the ground, CFMI searched for {{customers}} outside of a possible AMST contract. The main targets were re-engine contracts for the Douglas DC-8 and the Boeing 707 airliners, including the related military tanker, the KC-135 Stratotanker. There was little initial interest in the engine, but Boeing realized that the CFM56 might be a solution to upcoming noise regulations. After announcing that a 707 would be configured with the CFM56 engine for flight tests in 1977, Boeing officially offered the 707-320 with the CFM56 engine as an option in 1978. The new variant was listed as the 707-700. Due to limited interest from <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> in a re-engined 707, Boeing ended the 707-700 program in 1980 without selling any aircraft. Despite the lack of sales, having the commercial 707 available with the CFM56 helped the engine's competitiveness for the KC-135 re-engine contract.|$|E
2500|$|Previously <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> {{headquarters}} were on {{the third}} floor of the MAS Administrative Complex at Subang Airport, in Subang. Prior to the construction of the Kuala Lumpur MAS headquarters, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> rented space in the UMBC headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> had a permanent corporate headquarters in the Bangunan MAS, a 34 story building it owned along Jalan Sultan Ismail, in the Golden Triangle. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> occupied 20 stories in the building. The building was built for RM88mil. In 2005 The Star said that the building was [...] "reported to be worth between RM300mil and RM350mil". At one time before 2005 <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> chairperson, Raja Tun Mohar, made an oral promise to Tun Abdul Razak of the Government of Malaysia that <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> would not sell its headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> had 600 employees in the building.|$|R

5|$|Braathens SAFE's {{domestic}} market was deregulated on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> started a partnership.|$|E
5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, a {{political}} debate started concerning {{whether or not}} a new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway. A government report launched in 1970, suggested surveys for five locations: Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and Ås. Hobøl was preliminarily selected and areas reserved for a future airport. During the 1970s, the Labour Party became concerned that Hobøl was located too centrally in relation to the growth areas around Oslo, and instead wanted to use Gardermoen, in an attempt to force the population growth further north. Commercial interests and <b>the</b> <b>airlines</b> supported Hobøl. In 1983, Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hobøl and continue with a divided solution. Fornebu would be expanded, and all charter traffic be moved to Gardermoen. From 1988, all international traffic would also be moved, making Fornebu a purely domestic airport.|$|E
50|$|GeorgiaSkies was an American {{commuter}} airline brand founded by Pacific Air Holdings to operate flights in Georgia after <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> was awarded an Essential Air Service contract to serve Athens and Macon, Georgia. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> started flights on September 29, 2008 and used <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> identifiers and call signs of {{its parent company}} Pacific Wings. <b>The</b> <b>airline</b> was headquartered in Dallas, Texas.|$|R

An attempt to sell Ho's interest was ruled insufficient as much of <b>the</b> <b>airline's</b> start-up financing was Japanese, and <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> was sold later in the year to K P Harvest. In August 1991, <b>the</b> <b>airline</b> filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after K P Harvest itself went bankrupt.|$|R
