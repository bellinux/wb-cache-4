While Rad felt that the game presented little challenge as a minor complaint, Reiner considered its final puzzles disproportionately challenging.|$|E
5|$|Following Lego Racers success, news {{arose in}} April 2001 that Pocket Studios {{was working on}} a sequel to the Game Boy Advance version of Lego Racers, titled Lego Racers 2, which was then shown at E3 2001 in May that year. The eponymous Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 {{counterpart}} to Lego Racers 2, developed by Attention <b>to</b> <b>Detail,</b> was announced in August 2001, and released in September 2001. The sequel followed up immediately after Rocket Racer's deafeat in Lego Racers, who is shown a new opportunity to reclaim his title as world champion, by travelling to Xalax and prove himself worthy of it. After Rocket Racer proceeds to do so and succeeds, the player is tasked to control their self-built protagonist, racing through various worlds based on Lego themes, and eventually face Rocket Racer again. Lego Racers 2 was received less favorably than Lego Racers, and too far incorporated elements from both, Lego Racers and Rollcage, another game developed by Attention <b>to</b> <b>Detail.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He made up for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention <b>to</b> <b>detail,</b> and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness. Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E

5|$|Angel Beats! {{received}} generally positive reviews by critics. The {{integration of}} various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, {{saying that the}} story was overloaded with too many elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences and attention <b>to</b> <b>detail</b> with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime is too short, which leaves many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Even {{five years}} before Texas was complete, the blast effects from end-on fire were {{considered}} prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in European navies. This made Texass armament arrangement obsolete. The then-new Board on Construction considered a thorough re-design which would have placed Texass main guns on the centerline, either in two single turrets or one twin turret, and the heavy redoubt eliminated. Construction by this time was too far advanced for such a plan, however, and Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy limited the Board <b>to</b> <b>detail</b> improvements.|$|E
5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio.

Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E

5|$|Further {{light is}} shed upon Amenhotep's funerary cult by {{multiple}} documents which appear <b>to</b> <b>detail</b> the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri {{from the time}} of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol, including a recitation of a ḥtp-dỉ-nsw formula, and purifying and sealing the shrine {{at the end of the}} day. The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars {{received}} generally positive reviews. Reviewers lauded the game's pre-rendered cinematics, attention <b>to</b> <b>detail</b> in replicating the Halo universe, and intuitive control scheme. Complaints {{against the}} game included {{the lack of}} an option to play as the Covenant faction in campaign mode as well as the lack of strategic options during play. Critics from GameSpot and USA Today wrote that experienced RTS players would find the strategic elements of the title shallow. The game sold one million units worldwide through March 2009, making it the best-selling console real-time strategy game to date. An enhanced version of the game—Halo Wars: Definitive Edition—was released for Windows and Xbox One. Halo Wars 2, a sequel developed by 343 Industries and Creative Assembly was released in February 2017.|$|E
