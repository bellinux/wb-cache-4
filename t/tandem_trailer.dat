5000|$|Roads {{other than}} the Interstates are {{regulated}} by the individual states, and laws vary widely. Maximum weight varies between 80,000 lb to 171,000 lb, depending on the combination. Most states restrict operation of larger <b>tandem</b> <b>trailer</b> setups such as triple units, turnpike doubles and Rocky-Mountain doubles. Reasons for limiting the legal trailer configurations include both safety concerns and the impracticality of designing and constructing roads that can accommodate the larger wheelbase of these vehicles and the larger minimum turning radii associated with them. In general, these configurations are restricted to the Interstates. Except for these units, double setups are not restricted to certain roads {{any more than a}} single setup. They are also not restricted by weather conditions or [...] "difficulty of operation". The Canadian province of Ontario, however, does have weather-related operating restrictions for larger <b>tandem</b> <b>trailer</b> setups.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complex computer-based heuristic procedure for sizing customer orders and developing three dimensional load diagrams for rail and truck shipment of low density products. This heuristic procedure was developed for, {{and is in}} various phases of implementation at, a large multinational U. S. -based consumer products company. Products are shipped daily in high volume from inventory in corrugated containers of various sizes {{depending on the product}} package sizes and customer requirements. Vehicles used include railcars, truck <b>trailers</b> and <b>tandem</b> truck <b>trailers,</b> which also vary in size depending upon need and availability. In most cases, product volume or material handling considerations limit the amount of product loaded into vehicles before weight restrictions are met. Hence, the emphasis here is on low density products. The procedure developed has been demonstrated to significantly increase vehicle utilization, and improve customer service. It is fast and accurate enough to be used in real time during the order entry process. It has also been used successfully in a vehicle feasibility study of single versus <b>tandem</b> <b>trailers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Arriving on Earth {{to inform}} the Autobots there of the {{impending}} arrival of the Decepticon super-weapon, BlackZarak, Grand Maximus provided them with the schematics necessary to create the non-sentient drone, Godbomber. Able to connect to vehicle mode (Super) Ginrai as a <b>tandem</b> <b>trailer,</b> Godbomber could also transport the Transtectors of the three Headmaster Juniors - Cab, Shuta and Minerva - and most importantly, {{would be able to}} combine with Super Ginrai, powering him up into the new form of God Ginrai, giving him the strength necessary to battle Black Zarak. As the so-called [...] "Bomber Project" [...] proceeded apace under Metalhawk's command, Super Ginrai was dealt a severe defeat by the Decepticon, Overlord. Following a failed attack on the Bomber Project facility, the barely healed Ginrai insisted upon taking the fight to the Decepticons, combining with the completed Godbomber and confronting Overlord and Black Zarak on the moon. With the aid of Grand Maximus, God Ginrai was able to force Black Zarak to retreat back into space.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} about the study and design of a {{combined}} vehicle, specifically a truck with a three-axle <b>tandem</b> <b>trailer.</b> The project will calculate the driving resistances {{of this kind of}} vehicles and all the forces related to them. The driving resistances calculated will be used to find the power and torque that the truck engine needs. Then those parameters will be used to find an adequate engine for the truck that enables it to circulate and move properly. In this project a gearbox is also going to be designed to calculate the power and torque that arrives at the driving wheels considering the loss of power. With this power that arrives at the driving wheels {{it will be possible to}} calculate the acceleration of all combined vehicle. Finally there is presented some theory about vehicle dynamics and the force needed to unload the trailer using different unload systems will be determined and compared...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} way in which traYc data are used in exible {{pavement}} design and analysis procedures. A deterministic long-term pavement performance model (LTPPM) is used to calculate exible pavement damage caused by traYcking from three realistic eets of commercial vehicles. The eets have been modelled using seven-axle group models representing steer axles, drive axles (single or <b>tandem)</b> and <b>trailer</b> axles (<b>tandem</b> or tridem) with either steel suspensions or air suspensions. Results are compared with the calculated exible pavement damage caused by a eet of 80 kN standard axles and predictions from the currently used method of traYc characterization for UK pavement design procedures. Results show that pavements that fail by rutting last longer when traYcked by the realistic vehicle eets compared with the eet of 80 kN standard axles whereas the pavements that are predicted to fail by fatigue last longer when traYcked by the eet of 80 kN standard axles. Results also show that current UK pavement design procedures are more sensitive to diVerences in the vehicle eet compared with LTPPM predictions...|$|R
40|$|Described biotechnical {{measures}} {{focus on}} the use of woodchips in the formation of a structural reinforcement layer on forest roads in the places with high levels of groundwater. These are often short sections of roads which can thus block off entire forests. In history, these sections were overcome using corduroy roads. Currently, there are tendencies to revive the biotechnical technology and replace logs used for corduroy roads with woodchips. This study investigates the possible reinforcement of a waterlogged section using woodchips in a forest road of multifunctional character, which serves for cycling as well as timber transport. In total, three different types of reinforcement were constructed using woodchips in combination with geotextile and crushed stone. The reinforcement was tested by common operations using a timber extraction tractor with <b>tandem</b> axle <b>trailer.</b> The modulus of deformation was measured on the surface and the deformation characteristics of the layer were determined. Subsequently, the shape of the reinforcement cross-section was surveyed. The results have shown that, even with very low modulus of deformation values, the shape of the reinforcement cross-section does not change statistically in two types of the reinforcement technology. These two types of reinforcement can be successfully used for forest roads that perform the recreational function or for timber transport by tractor. The main advantages are that renewable material is used and no extraction and moving of the ground occur during its production...|$|R
