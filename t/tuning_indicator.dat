5000|$|In 1962, Hacker {{released}} the RV14 Mayflower; an FM-only valve table radio finished in striking veneers. Unusually for a Hacker, this set had coverage to 108 MHz - the FM front end was supplied by Görler.

5000|$|The {{advent of}} radio {{broadcasting}} increased {{the market for}} radio receivers greatly, and transformed them into a consumer product. At {{the beginning of the}} 1920s the radio receiver was a forbidding high-tech device, with many cryptic knobs and controls requiring technical skill to operate, housed in an unattractive black metal box, with a tinny-sounding horn loudspeaker. [...] By the 1930s, the broadcast receiver had become a piece of furniture, housed in an attractive wooden case, with standardized controls anyone could use, which occupied a respected place in the home living room. In the early radios the multiple tuned circuits required multiple knobs to be adjusted to tune in a new station. One of the most important ease-of-use innovations was [...] "single knob tuning", achieved by linking the tuning capacitors together mechanically. [...] The dynamic cone loudspeaker invented in 1924 greatly improved audio frequency response over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity. Convenience features like large lighted dials, tone controls, pushbutton <b>tuning,</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>indicators</b> and automatic gain control (AGC) were added. [...] The receiver market was divided into the above broadcast receivers and communications receivers, which were used for two-way radio communications such as shortwave radio.|$|R

5000|$|The Gonset Communicators were {{packaged}} {{in a square}} box with a carrying handle and a UHF connector for the antenna on top, making them quite portable. Early models had a magic eye tube <b>tuning</b> <b>indicator</b> in front. The configuration earned them the name [...] "Gooney Box." [...] The radios could operate from 110 volt AC mains, or 6 or 12 volt DC from a car battery. A simple whip antenna could be plugged into the antenna connector on top. The transmit/receive switch {{was on the front}} panel, not the microphone. The Gonset could also be connected to an external speaker and used as a public address (PA) system.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/PRC-6 circuit uses 13 {{vacuum tubes}} for the {{receiver}} and transmitter combined, all but one subminiature.

5000|$|Kenyon Taylor {{came to the}} {{attention}} of Albert Hall who was the personal assistant of Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti of the Ferranti company Manchester and joined them as a lab boy in March 1931. For some time, Ferranti had been contracted by J P Coats of Paisley to develop a very high speed cotton doubling frame but had been plagued for years with problems relating to the dynamic balance of tubular flyers. Working together with Dr Vincent Ferranti, Taylor eventually produced a solution described in his first British Patent 399,845. In the mid 1920s in order to produce their own valves (vacuum tubes) and to keep pace with the rapid expansion in radio technology, Ferranti had begun expanding their radio business at Stalybridge One of Taylor's early contributions to this effort was a diode pentode valve (tube) for use in radio receivers described in patent GB 412,693 [...] which was sold to the Patent pool [...] Hall and Taylor also produced and patented a system for improving the treble tone or sound of a radio with a novel adjustable filtering system.As well as working on radio, around 1933 Ferranti started to take an interest in Mechanical television and Taylor played a significant part in its development too. When Ferranti purchased shares in the Scophony company he produced a light source for the Scophony system [...] and a method to lock the picture to the transmitter. In 1934 during the manufacture of radio components, Taylor together with Arthur Chilcot produced and patented a cathode ray <b>tuning</b> <b>indicator</b> often referred to as a Magic Eye. Taylor was involved in the manufacture of cathode ray tubes and here he had several patents concerning electronic improvements and methods to apply the screen coatings. As well as making improvements to the focusing of these crts, he also patented a method of connecting them with a video signal. By 1935 Ferranti had acquired bigger premises at Moston and when Dr Vincent Ferranti employed Dr N H Searby as their Chief engineer, Taylor became their chief research engineer. In the mid 1930s the future of television broadcasting was decided by a committee set up by the British government 405 TV Trials. Dr Vincent Ferranti and Hall were called to the committee along with other television manufacturers to give their input. They argued for the case of keeping low definition TV in the north of England as they knew it would be a long time before high definition (405 TV) would become available outside London. However, the outcome was mechanical television of the Baird type was rejected in favour of an all electronic system demonstrated by Marconi-EMI. In 1936 Dr Searby employed an Oxford graduate Hubert Wood [...] who worked with Taylor on radio and television, but in the buildup to WW2, television development was put aside as they were assigned to work on a team developing IFF headed by F.C. Williams a scientist at TRE Bawdsey, in conjunction with James Rennie Whitehead. Several patents followed from this work and Hubert Wood refined the IFF Mark III seeing it into commercial production after the war. During the war food was important and Taylor produced a novel method of fast drying seeds or grain for which he obtained a patent with Frank Humber.|$|E
40|$|Abstract —Quality {{requirements}} of a software system cannot be optimally met, especially when it is running in an uncertain and changing environment. In principle, a controller at runtime can monitor the change impact on quality {{requirements of}} the system, update the expectations and priorities from the environment, and take reasonable actions to improve the overall satisfaction. In practice, however, existing controllers are mostly designed for <b>tuning</b> low-level performance <b>indicators</b> rather than high-level requirements. By linking the overall satisfaction to a business value indicator as feedback, we propose a control-theoretic self-tuning method that can dynamically adjust the tradeoff decisions among different quality requirements. A preference-based reasoning algorithm is involved to configure hard goals accordingly to guide the following architecture reconfiguration. Keywords-control theory; goal reasoning; self-tuning I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a neural network-based {{stock price}} {{prediction}} and trading system using technical analysis indicators is presented. The model developed first converts the financial time series data {{into a series}} of buy-sell-hold trigger signals using the most commonly preferred technical analysis indicators. Then, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained in the learning stage on the daily stock prices between 1997 and 2007 for all of the Dow 30 stocks. Apache Spark big data framework is used in the training stage. The trained model is then tested with data from 2007 to 2017. The results indicate that by choosing the most appropriate technical indicators, the neural network model can achieve comparable results against the Buy and Hold strategy in most of the cases. Furthermore, fine <b>tuning</b> the technical <b>indicators</b> and/or optimization strategy can enhance the overall trading performance.

40|$|There are {{different}} automatic downstream control algorithms developed {{to increase the}} flexibility of the irrigation system. CARDD control logic is one of the heuristic and distance automatic downstream control systems. In this research, mathematical model of the CARDD control logic coordinated with ICSS hydrodynamic model was developed and the CARDD control logic was tested and evaluated under different situations. In order to evaluate the performance of this control algorithm, one of the canals suggested by ASCE (canal number 2) was used. The CARDD control algorithm was tested under the operational scenarios suggested by ASCE in which the control algorithm was evaluated by intense and gradual flow changes in a newly constructed (<b>tuned)</b> canal. Performance <b>indicators</b> were calculated and analysed. In the case of gradual flow changes, the maximum diversion of the water depth from the target was about 5 % and was always in permitted range. In intense flow changes, the maximum diversion of the water depth from the target was about 8 % and it was recovered in about 1 hour, which is a considerable time. The charts showing the variation of water depth at each turnout and the calculated performance indicators showed the satisfactory performance of CARDD control algorithm in gradual flow changes. In intense flow changes, although the maximum variation of the water depth was limited, the system response time was relatively long...|$|R
40|$|PSK 31 {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{communications}} modes to capture the interest of hams worldwide. Its inherent ability to dig out low, near-inaudible signals is ideally suited for low power QRP enthusiasts. The PSK 31 digital modem engine, however, requires intense DSP processing that is only commonly available in PC sound card. Thus the PSK operator desiring portability for field operation is locked into using a laptop computer as a controller, which results in a cumbersome station. But there’s hope! This paper presents the design and construction of a standalone, battery-operated digital modem using a Microchip dsPIC microcontroller. The project includes a character display for transmit and receive text data, and a graphic display showing band spectrum and <b>tuning</b> <b>indicator.</b> Using GPL open source software, the modem can be homebrewed for less than $ 50 parts cost. When coupled with an SSB-capable transceiver or with a popular PSK-xx transceiver board from Small Wonder Labs, you too can have an effective portable PSK 31 station.

40|$|Synthesis of Novel Peptide Based Receptors for Pyrophosphate Recognition in Aqueous Media Pyrophosphate (P 2 O 74 -, PPi) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in energy transduction in organisms and controls metabolic processes by participation in enzymatic reactions. Considerable efforts have been devoted to establishing analytical methods for the detection and sensing of PPi with high levels of selectivity and affinity in aqueous media. A library of backbone rigidified cyclic peptide based receptors bearing bis[Zn(II) –DPA] binding sites was initially developed by altering the size of the cyclic peptide scaffolds, adjusting the distance between the binding sites and reducing the spacers between the binding units and the scaffolds. The synthesis of these novel anion receptors was achieved through Fmoc strategy solid phase peptide synthesis followed by macrolactamization and side chain functionalization. Optimization of the synthetic protocols resulted in improvements in both the yields and efficiency of this multi-step synthesis. With these cyclic peptide based Zn(II) -DPA receptors in hand, colorimetric indicator displacement assays (IDAs) were carried out to allow the examination of the anion binding properties of these receptors using three different indicators pyrocatechol violet (PV), pyrogallol red (PR) and bromopyrogallol red (BPR) in HEPES buffer containing high NaCl concentrations and biologically relevant Krebs saline. Enhanced preference of the cyclic peptide derived receptors for PPi over ATP and ADP was found when <b>tuning</b> the <b>indicator</b> from PV to PR or BPR. Notably, these cyclic peptide derived receptors in combination with PV displayed decreased affinity but greatly enhanced selectivity for PPi when moving from HEPES buffer to Krebs saline. Importantly, ratiometric detection of PPi in the presence of a large excess of ATP was confirmed using 1 : 1 41 :PV chemosensing ensemble in Krebs saline. Additionally, receptor 59 was demonstrated to be the first example of an IDA for real time assessment of the enzymatic activity of pyrophosphatase. To reduce the synthetic complexity, oxazole based linear tetrapeptides bearing two Zn(II) -DPA binding units were initially generated. Subsequently, the methodology for sequential click chemistry on solid phase was developed to conveniently incorporate fluorophores, Zn(II) –DPA affinity units and an additional hydrogen-bond donor unit to linear peptide scaffolds. A family of clickable sensors was synthesized with high efficiency. A coumarin derived fluorophore was also attached to the oxazole based linear and cyclic peptide receptors through click chemistry to give novel sensors. The anion binding investigation revealed the unique binding behavior of the novel sensors for PPi. Remarkably, significantly improved selectivity of both linear and cyclic peptide based receptors for PPi over competing ATP and ADP was achieved by covalently linking a coumarin derived signaling unit to the peptide scaffolds. Both IDA based receptors and indicator-spacer-receptor (ISR) based receptors have been successfully employed in urinary PPi detection and pyrophosphatase assays. The strategy of sequential click chemistry on solid support has been shown to be exceedingly promising for the construction of new anion sensor systems.
