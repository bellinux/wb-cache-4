In a word, despite our different musical identities, it would seem we are following a single path; and I, for my part, am proud <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} from China to Britain {{for the first}} time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly {{the same size as}} an Aylesbury at nine weeks.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that Nicholas was born later than the 1230s, as he was styled Magister by 1259, indicating that by that date he possessed a Master's degree.

In 1968, he announced that Neiman-Marcus's buyers would give preference to companies employing and training significant numbers of minority employees, making his firm one of the first companies in the nation <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> policy.|$|E

At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.|$|E

Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining.

5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E

She asked Lennart to call her by her name as she felt embarrassed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> grown up son.

General Commencements have since returned to the University of California campus, with the exercises being performed at Haas Pavilion, Hearst Greek Theatre, and most recently Edwards Stadium.
