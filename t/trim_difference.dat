40|$|Transgressions, {{profound}} or trifling, occur {{frequently in}} our lives. Research suggests that forgiving has important benefits. I {{examined the effects}} of empathy, purportedly the only manipulation known to increase forgiveness in an experimental setting, and elevation, a moral emotion that, like empathy, focuses on others, on forgiveness. I hypothesized that empathy and elevation would increase forgiveness. 96 undergraduates viewed an amusing, elevating, or neutral video. They completed an empathy-building or neutral writing task. They completed the Transgression-Related Interpersonal Motivations Inventory (TRIM) once before and once after these manipulations. A lack of participants forced collapsing across writing conditions. Supporting my hypothesis, an analysis of mean <b>TRIM</b> <b>difference</b> score showed that the elevation condition was significantly greater than the neutral condition.

2500|$|There {{were little}} more than <b>trim</b> <b>differences</b> between the Fleetwood and the DeVille. For 1986, Fleetwood was an option package on the DeVille and {{technically}} not a separate model. It returned to separate model status in 1987 (as [...] "Fleetwood d'Elegance"). The d'Elegance package which had previously been available on both the DeVille and Fleetwood Brougham, instead became optional on the FWD Fleetwood and RWD Brougham only. The Fleetwood coupe was dropped in 1987, but returned in 1989.|$|R
50|$|For 1956, the Caribbean {{was broken}} out {{into its own}} luxury series, and gained a hardtop model. <b>Trim</b> <b>differences</b> between the 1955 and 1956 cars were slight. Grille textures changed, and matched the ones used on {{concurrent}} Patricians, and the rear treatment, featuring Packard's cathedral style taillights also continued. The headlights also received slightly more exaggerated hoods. Total model year production equaled 263 hardtops and 276 convertibles. The model was discontinued when Packard production ended in Detroit.|$|R

This 331 cu in (5.4 L) engine {{produced}} 160 hp (119 kW).The major difference between Series 61 and Series 62 models of similar body style was minor trim variations. The higher-priced series again had grooved, front fender stone shields and bright rocker panel moldings. Chevrons below the taillights were no longer seen. The convertible was an exclusive offering. A heater was optional. Sales reached a record 55,643.|$|R
50|$|A {{substantial}} number of separate marque and model names applied to this single car platform. Some were given different model names to justify <b>trim</b> <b>differences</b> (Hillman GT, Hillman Estate Car) and that {{from time to time}} all models were sold in some European markets under the Sunbeam marque (Sunbeam Sceptre for instance), and at other times used UK marque/model names. To add complication, Singer Gazelle/Vogue models were also sold in the UK for one season badged as Sunbeams after the Singer brand was withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|Canadian spec {{models were}} even better equipped. Generally, the Canadian base models {{received}} {{the same level of}} options as an American GL, and the same with the GL and Carat. Other Canadian specification differences were diesel engines (both naturally aspirated and Turbo) available for all years (in the US, there was no diesel for 1988, and only the n/a for 1989 and 1990), a 2-door model for 1992 (it was dropped in the US), the early Carat model (which had heated velour sport seats, a GLi engine, and optional automatic), and color and <b>trim</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Along with <b>trim</b> <b>differences,</b> {{such as a}} {{different}} grille without {{a dip in the}} lower middle part, bumper overriders meant that the 1100 was also 35 mm longer than its predecessor. Somehow the weight dropped by 40 kilos, to 800 kg. The 1100 was also available with a floor-mounted shifter, unlike the 1000 and later 1200. Originally available in Standard or DeLuxe trims, a Sporty DeLuxe version joined the lineup soon after its introduction. This also formed the basis for the Colt 1500 SS. The Colt 1100 was replaced by the [...] "New Colt" [...] 1200 in 1968.|$|R
50|$|The second {{iteration}} 180SX {{was released}} in January 1991 and included several major changes from the first model. This included the SR20DET engine with 202 hp. Although the engine was larger than the previous CA18DET engine the '180SX' nomenclature remained. The brakes were enlarged and limited slip differential added. The front bumper {{and parts of the}} interior were also redesigned. Type I and Type II were once again offered with only <b>trim</b> <b>differences</b> separating the two. The 15-inch alloy wheels also changed in design from the first model. Nissan's Super HICAS four wheel steering was an option on all models as were 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions.|$|R

5000|$|For the October 1962 Motor Show {{there were}} minor improvements. The rear window {{was changed to}} give the roof line an {{improved}} appearance and now more nearly match the original 1955 Chevrolet shape. Engine output was now rated at [...] bhp and the rear axle {{had been given a}} higher gear ratio. Manual gearbox cars received a new type of diaphragm clutch made by Borg and Beck and the petrol tank was enlarged from 12.5 to 16 gallons capacity. It can be distinguished by its revised rear-window treatment (doesn't wrap around quite as much as earlier models), Snipe bird badge on grille, opening quarter-light windows in the rear doors, and other <b>trim</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 4.2-litre Quattroporte now came {{equipped}} with single-rate damping comfort-tuned suspension and 18 inch wheels.Debuting alongside {{it was the}} Quattroporte S, powered by a wet-sump 4.7-litre V8, the same engine of the Maserati GranTurismo S, with a maximum power of [...] and maximum torque of 490 Nm. In conjunction with the engine, the braking system was upgraded to cross-drilled discs on both axles and dual-cast 360 mm rotors with six piston callipers at the front. Skyhook active damping suspension and 19 inch V-spoke wheels were standard. <b>Trim</b> <b>differences</b> from the 4.2-litre cars were limited to a chrome instead of titanium-coloured front grille.Production of the restyled vehicle started in June 2008 as Model Year 2009.|$|R

50|$|The Ami Super {{was offered}} in the same three trim levels as the Ami 8, Luxe, Confort and Club on Saloon and Luxe and Confort on Break (estate) versions. These <b>trim</b> <b>differences</b> were fairly minor with Luxe models having bench front and rear seats and vinyl floor matting. Confort trim offered {{reclining}} front seats {{in place of the}} front bench. The Club models can be considered the Pallas of the Ami range featured sound proofing pads on the floor and bulkhead, carpet including boot lining, stainless steel trim on the window frames and side rubbing strips on the doors and rear wings.

5000|$|The Ranger A, {{like its}} South African counterpart, had a Vauxhall-style grille. Sold by dealers {{alongside}} Vauxhalls, the lineup was carefully limited {{so as not}} to compete directly with Vauxhall's four-door only Victor, and thus the smaller-engined Ranger As were usually only available as two-doors. At Geneva 1971, General Motors Continental and General Motors Suisse presented the new Ranger B alongside its Opel Rekord D twin. Aside from some minor <b>trim</b> <b>differences,</b> including twin headlights and a grille with a crossbar, as well as different taillights and a rear license plate mounted higher than on the Rekord. The Ranger B used a [...] "humped" [...] bonnet, similar to but different from the one used on Rekord D diesels.

Reflecting the new emissions rules, power from the Opel-sourced engine was down from [...] From this point, all four-cylinder models were marketed as Sunbirds and the six- or eight-cylinder models as Toranas. The original LX series Sunbird was a single-trim range, with four-speed manual and three-speed automatic transmissions. There were minor <b>trim</b> <b>differences</b> compared to the Torana, notably the grille (with vertical bars) and distinctive chrome wheel covers. It was marketed as a four-door sedan and as a three-door hatchback, unlike the short-lived four-cylinder LX Torana. The introduction of Sunbird also coincided with the first attempt by Holden to add a handling package to its range of cars. The introduction of 'radial-tuned suspension' (RTS) began with the LX Sunbird sedan and hatchback and then the LX Torana.|$|R
5000|$|In 1964 and 1965, GM of Canada sold an [...] "Acadian Beaumont" [...] {{based on}} the Chevelle [...] "A" [...] body platform, and {{continued}} to sell the Chevy II-based Acadian. This can be confusing for some. By 1966, {{it was clear that}} the Acadian was Chevy II-based, and the Beaumont was Chevelle- based. Many people consider the cars to be Pontiacs, but GM marketed both cars as separate makes. These cars in every year are primarily Chevrolet, with only minor <b>trim</b> <b>differences</b> and (for Chevelle-based cars) Pontiac Tempest/LeMans-based instrument panels. This was done because Canada required GM to have a certain percentage of Canadian content in the vehicles sold in this country. The Beaumont continuing to gain popularity was now available in 4 series on the Acadian. [...] "Beaumont Standard", [...] "Beaumont Deluxe Standard", [...] "Beaumont Custom" [...] and [...] "Beaumont Sport Deluxe". A base-trimmed Beaumont Standard convertible was also offered, a model also produced in the base Chevelle line in Canada, but not in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The Dolomite changed {{very little}} (in all its variants) from the {{beginning}} to the very end, only minor <b>trim</b> <b>differences</b> and additional standard equipment being the main changes. 1979 saw the introduction of the Dolomite SE, of which 2163 were built. The bodyshell was of the basic 1500 (single headlamps) but the interior was fitted with luxury trim including burr walnut dashboard and door cappings (the dashboard was the same style as fitted to that of the Dolomite 1300), grey velour seats and matching carpet. All the cars were painted black with wide silver stripes running full length, with the letters [...] "SE" [...] {{at the end of the}} rear wing. The SE also sported a front spoiler and Spitfire style road wheels. By the late 1970s the Dolomite was looking increasingly old fashioned against newer competition, though still popular. Designer Giovanni Michelotti delivered a promising new design (Sprint based) and resembling a Fiat 132 [...] with a squared front and BMW style 'kink'. At least one full-size example was built. With severe problems at BLMC, management refused, there was simply not enough money. Production continued until August 1980 when BL closed the Canley Factory as part of a restructuring process which also resulted in the closure of the MG factory at Abingdon two months later.|$|R

CL models also got red reflex panels carrying the [...] taillights onto the trunk/hatch, body-colored bumpers, and new aluminum wheels. [...] The 1987 Chevrolet Nova continued in two body styles, a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback. The four-door proved by far the more popular – by about three to one. Nova's only engine was again a 74-horsepower 1.6-liter four designed by Toyota, mated to either a five-speed manual transmission or four-speed automatic. Though Corollas were priced slightly below competing Novas, Chevy's version of the car could often be bought for less because slow sales encouraged dealers to discount prices. [...] "Slow sales," [...] however, meant slow by Chevy standards, for the Nova sold about as well as the Corolla, and buyers would find that their discounted Nova in turn had a lower resale value than the equivalent Toyota, a pattern that would persist for GM-branded NUMMI cars. Aside from some minor interior and exterior <b>trim</b> <b>differences,</b> the cars were much the same, though Novas had a slightly softer suspension that favored ride over handling.|$|R
