500|$|According to Staten, Tor Books asked Bungie if {{they had}} someone suited to writing the next novel; Staten, having written much of the Halo series canon, was the obvious choice. The author found that the book was {{the perfect way to}} {{elaborate}} on the Halo story without stripping it down for a video game: [...] "I always felt we shortchanged [...] We don't {{have a lot of time}} to <b>tell</b> <b>story</b> while the bullets are flying." [...] In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as a well-rounded character. Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo. The author also said that the work of his favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice".|$|E

6000|$|I must {{remind the}} readers {{again that the}} De Republica is a fragment: the first part is wanting. We find him telling us {{the story of the}} elder Cato, in order that we may {{understand}} how good it is that we should not relax in our public work as long as our health will sustain us. Then he gives instances to show that the truly good citizen will not be deterred by the example of men who have suffered for their country, and among the number he names himself. But he soon introduces the form of dialogue which he afterward continues, and brings especially the younger Scipio and Lælius upon the scene. The lessons which are given to us are supposed to come from the virtue of the titular grandson of the greater Scipio who out-manoeuvred Hannibal. He continues to <b>tell</b> <b>story</b> after story out of the Roman chronicles, and at last assures us that that form of government is the best in which the monarchical element is tempered by the authority of the leading citizens, and kept alive by the voices of the people. Is it only because I am an Englishman that he seems to me to describe that form of government which was to come in England? ...|$|E

30|$|The {{simple answer}} {{is that we are}} humans and we need to <b>tell</b> <b>stories.</b> We need to <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> that glorify the human estate. We need heroes.

We <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about leaders and leaders <b>tell</b> <b>stories</b> about {{themselves}} that allow us to imagine that we control an uncontrollable world. That’s very good. I think, if you could just imagine – suppose you had a choice, a world that’s uncontrollable – would you rather imagine that you could control it, or give up? For me, the human being who imagines he or she can control it is a more attractive human being.|$|R
