40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{development}} of partnerships for sustainable development as {{a process in which}} actors from various sectors of society (state, market and civil) restructure and build new social relationships to create a more sustainable management practice. In <b>the</b> <b>relevent</b> <b>literature</b> we recognize three perspectives on this issue. From the fi rst, partnerships are studied as single collaborative arrangements. From the second perspective, attention is turned to the external effects of partnerships. Partnership arrangements are seen as tools for deliberate societal change. The third perspective takes a broader view on the governance system. Attention is focused on the changes that partnerships make in the confi guration of public decision-making structures. These perspectives will be connected in a Ladder of Partnership Activity, a conceptual device that allows us to better understand and analyse partnerships. The Ladder consists of fi ve core levels, set in a time frame. Each level is represented by a core activity. The Ladder is further encapsulated in three dimensions. Taking examples from recent empirical studies, the paper discusses each of the levels and their relationships. The fi nal section refl ects on the applicability of the Ladder concept and its strengths and weaknesses. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this dissertation, the problem of elderly or aging employees is examined - especially {{in the fields of}} demographic change, (high) unemployment, problems with pension financing, requirements of employers, and qualitiy of life. In this thesis, theories of Age-Research, with regard to <b>the</b> <b>relevent</b> <b>literature,</b> are discussed, <b>the</b> field of research concerning elderly workers is circumscribed, and topics are defined. Furthermore, a research technique is developed, which is to be used to accomplish a case study on the base of expert interviews. This case study generates information to design practical models for the sustainable integration of elderly workers. Subsequently, cornerstones concerning an action programme for the potential solution of the addressed problems are singled out. These results are developed and specified, using the adequate literature, to configuration-models for elderly workers. This will be done under three premises: 1. to allow for a longer gainful employment; 2. to advance the interaction between generations; 3. to design jobs which are open to qualification and not hazardous to the employees health. There are two aspects to the configuration-models: On the one hand, with reference to the Seven-Level-Model by Luczak and Volpert, a topic catalog is developed, including criteria of industrial ergonomics as well as the initial questions. On the other hand, there are descriptions of full and part-time posts for older workers, which could be done in- or outside the enterprise. Finally, with consideration to the current political developments, a model of research design is developed, which identifies and discusses the chances of the implementation of the configuration-models in order to evaluate the socio-political derivatives from the case study. In addition, further research demands are concretized...|$|R

A brief overview of the field of UPS of chemical transients, including a survey of <b>the</b> <b>relevent</b> <b>literature,</b> and a general introduction to topics covered in this thesis are given in Chapter 1. Chapters 2, 4 and 5 present results of UPS investigations of the first photoelectron bands of alkyl radicals produced by pyrolysis of the corresponding alkyl nitrites. Spectra have been obtained for methyl, ethyl, 1 -propyl, 2 -propyl, tert-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and 2 -norbornyl radicals. Adiabatic ionization potentials determined for these species are used to calculate heats of formation of the ions, heterolytic bond dissociation energies of the corresponding alkanes, and proton affinities of the corresponding olefins. The shapes of the bands are discussed qualitatively in terms of structural differences between neutrals and positive ions. Chapter 3 is a discussion of the lowest energy conformations of ethyl and tert-butyl radicals. In particular, ESR and theoretical results from the literature are used to discuss the question of the planarity of alkyl radical centers. Chapters 4 and 6 present results of studies of the thermal decomposition mechanisms of 2 -norbornyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl radicals. Pyrolysis of the radicals is readily observed under the conditions necessary for their generation. The mechanisms deduced from the spectra are compared to those resulting from studies using classical techniques. In Chapter 7, experiments designed to assess the fate of reaction exothermicity in the pyrolysis of some strained azo compounds are described. The results indicate that very little of the available energy is released to vibration of the N_ 2 fragment.

40|$|Streptomyces fradiae is a {{bacterium}} {{which has been}} previously found to produce extracellular enzymes which are capable of wool degradation and skin depilation. Streptomyces fradiae 3739 and other strains of Streptomyces were {{found in this study}} to be able to degrade a keratin source (wool) to a considerable degree. However according to the evidence of SEM micrographs presented here the highly keratinised spindle cells of the paracortex are fairly resistant to protease attack, and it is the cementation material which binds these cells together which is initially degraded by the proteases. A large degree of correlation was found with the strains of Streptomyces studied, between the ability of the individual strains to degrade wool and the ability of their extracellular proteases to reduce the depilation load of sheepskins. With further analysis S. fradiae 3739 was found to produce at least one amylase and four or more proteases. The proteases as a group had maximal proteolytic activity in the 8. 0 - 9. 0 pH unit range, and were considerably thermostabilised by the inclusion of calcium ions into the reaction solution. The protease group was found to cause depilation of merino sheepskins. For comparative purposes a protease produced by a strain of Proteus vulgaris isolated from a staling hide with hair slip (natural depilation) was studied. The protease activity was maximal in the alkaline region between 8. 0 - 9. 0 pH units. Tbe protease appeared to be a single enzyme with a molecular mass of approximately 44 000 daltons. The protease was maximally active at 40 °C, although it was only thermostable to 30 °C. The enzyme was ineffectual as a depilant except when the skin was pre-treated with a strong alkali, preferably including sodium sulphite in the protease preparation. One of the most important differences between the extracellular proteases of S. fradiae and P. vulgaris was that the former were greater in variety and caused a greater decrease in the depilation load of sheepskins than the latter. Further research with mixtures of commercial proteases provided evidence that a synergistic depilatory effect occurs when proteases of complementary bond specificities are used in conjunction in enzymic depilatory preparations. Some form of strong alkali treatment of skins was found to be necessary to produce leather of the prerequisite quality when the skin was depilated by proteases, otherwise the skin was found to be depleted and stiff. Calcium hydroxide alone was found to be inadequate for this task, probably owing {{to the fact that it}} is less alkaline than the lime-sulphide mixture. The calcium hydroxide (lime) must therefore be used in conjunction with sodium hydroxide (which makes the solution as alkaline as that of the lime-sulphide solution) to produce leather comparable to that produced by the lime sulphide treatment. A combination of the information provided by the present research and that gleaned from <b>the</b> <b>relevent</b> <b>literature</b> allows for <b>the</b> construction of a model to represent the possible mechanism of enzymic depilation of skins, in which depilation is caused by the disruption of the basement membrane at the dermal-epidermal junction by the degradation of its constituent molecular components by general proteases, resulting in the removal of the epidermis and its associated wool or hai...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to viscous and turbulent mixing. It is comprised of two main sections that study two important classes of mixing flows from {{each end of the}} Reynolds Number range. The first section describes an SPH study of very viscous mixing using a two-dimensional Twin Cam mixer and the development of numerical tools to study the chaotic mixing within this device. The second section studies the application of SPH to Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of two-dimensional turbulence in a square box with no-slip boundaries. The primary focus of this section is to evaluate how well SPH can reproduce the primary characteristics of 2 D wall-bounded turbulence. These characteristics include those near the no-slip boundaries of the box (e. g. the boundary layer and vortex roll-up) as well as those in the central turbulent flow (e. g. the inverse energy and direct enstrophy cascades). Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the two types of mixing flows that are investigated in this thesis. The chapter covers the motivations behind this research and provides a summary of <b>the</b> <b>relevent</b> <b>literature.</b> Chapter 2 gives an overview of the SPH method and the particular formulation used in this thesis. Chapter 3 describes 2 D SPH simulations of a Twin Cam mixer and compares the results against experimental data and results from two published Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. A methodology for the analysis and quantification of the chaotic mixing is presented and applied to the Twin Cam mixer. The first half of this methodology is based on the use of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE) to visualise the chaotic manifolds of the flow. The topology of the manifolds describe the stretching and folding actions of the mixing, and define regions in the flow that are substantially isolated (ie. slow to mix) from neighbouring regions. A method of calculating the spatial distribution of FTLE directly from the SPH particle data is presented, which represents a considerable reduction in computational cost compared to previously published methods. The second half of the analysis methodology is based on a quantitative measure of mixing. Given a length scale of interest, this measure calculates the local amount of mixing between two or more regions. The measure is used to show the differences in both the spatial variation and total amount of mixing between the important regions in the flow previously identified by the chaotic manifolds. The chapter finishes by comparing the time scales of mixing over different length scales in the Twin Cam mixer. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the current theoretical description of homogeneous and isotropic 3 D and 2 D turbulence. It also covers recent numerical and experimental results for DNS turbulence in periodic and wall-bounded domains. A literature review of SPH turbulence is given. The chapter ends by discussing the primary motivations behind this investigation of SPH DNS of two-dimensional wall-bounded turbulence. Chapter 5 presents the results of ensemble SPH simulations of decaying wall-bounded 2 D turbulence at a Reynolds number (Re) of 1500. These are compared against published results from a pseudospectral code. The qualitative variables of the SPH turbulence evolution (e. g. kinetic energy decay, angular momentum and average vortex wavenumber) compare well with the pseudospectral results. However, the production of long-lived coherent vortices from the boundaries is not seen in the SPH simulations. Subsequent results show that the boundary layer and vortex roll-up are modelled well by the SPH method, but excess numerical dissipation prevents the vortex from surviving once it has detached from the boundary. Chapter 6 investigates SPH simulations of forced wall-bounded (Re = 1581) and periodic (Re = 2645) 2 D turbulence. As for the decaying case, these results are compared against published pseudospectral simulations and physical experiments. The SPH simulations reproduce the direct enstrophy cascade well. The kinetic energy spectrum follows the expected k- 3 scaling in the direct enstrophy range for wavelengths larger than 8 particle spacings. However, velocity fluctuations at wavelengths less than 8 particle spacings are responsible for a significant amount of numerical dissipation. This dissipation acts to weaken the inverse energy cascade and prevents the build-up of energy in the longest wavelength. Investigations into the statistics of particle pair dispersion show deviations in the expected scalings at wavelengths less than the forcing scale. These deviations are consistent with the small-scale velocity fluctuations acting as an additional forcing term and increasing the rate of mixing at small length scales. SPH parameter studies show that the turbulence is very sensitive to the SPH sound speed, with increasing sound speed resulting in a significant increase in numerical dissipation and a subsequent reduction in the strength of the inverse energy cascade. The maximum wavelength of the small-scale velocity fluctuations decreases slowly with increasing resolution. It is estimated that a minimum particle resolution of 3500 x 3500 is needed to reduce the minimum wavelength of the velocity fluctuations below the dissipation length scale of the turbulence (for Re = 1581). Chapter 7 compares the Cubic Spline and Wendland kernels and their effect on particle clumping in the forced 2 D turbulence simulations. The Cubic Spline is found to generate significant clumping on a length scale equal to the location of the spline point (typically chosen to be the smoothing length h). In contrast, the Wendland kernel results in a very even distribution of particles, which dramatically reduces the numerical dissipation in the forced turbulence simulations and strengthens the inverse energy cascade. Particle clumping in SPH simulations is often attributed to the Tensile Instability. However, the criteria for this instability is unchanged between the Cubic Spline and Wendland kernels leading {{to the conclusion that the}} Tensile Instability is not the cause of the clumping seen in these simulations...|$|R

The set of curves are extracted using level curves based representation centered on facial feature point landmarks. We apply our framework to study and compare this set through the computation of the geodesic distance between corresponding curves on different 3 D facial models. AdaBoost considers each curve as a weak classifier and selects iteratively relevant curves and show that there is significant improvement in results. The effectiveness of this technique is evaluated on a subset taken from BU- 3 DFE(3 D Facial Expression Database - Binghamton University) database. The proposed approach increase authentication performances using AdaBoost classifier compared to a simple fusion of scores from all curves...|$|R
