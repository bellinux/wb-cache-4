5|$|British and European audiences {{typically}} followed {{concert hall}} behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, {{and they were}} more reserved in their behaviour than were audiences of other forms of rock.

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{strength}} of the American and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began operations against German targets. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942. Air raids continued on targets further from Britain after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on American fighter aircraft. Göring refused to believe reports <b>that</b> <b>American</b> fighters had been shot down as far east as Aachen in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.|$|E
5000|$|The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America is a 1962 book by the {{political}} historian Daniel J. Boorstin.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} analyzes Americans' {{views on}} distributive justice and asks whether {{and to what}} extent Americans support meritocratic ideals. The project finds <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> are ambivalent in their views towards meritocracy. They believe that intelligence and hard work should be rewarded, but they also support inherited wealth, seniority pay, and the distribution of educational opportunities through the market. This project contributes much to the existing literature on public opinion and meritocracy because it finds <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> are not as meritocratic as other studies have found. For example, Lipset and others have found <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> support meritocratic ideals. It has also been shown <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> believe <b>that</b> the US is a meritocratic society where intelligence and hard work is actually rewarded. Data from the International Social Justice Project, General Social Survey, World Values Survey and many public opinion polls are used in this project and confirm the previous findings. However, the data also show <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> are ambivalent {{when it comes to their}} support of meritocratic ideals. Americans support the distribution of wealth by heredity, of income by seniority, and believe it is fair for educational opportunities to be distributed via the market where the wealthy can purchase superior opportunities for their children. In short, Americans are not strictly meritocratic in their distributive preferences. They often consider items other than merit to be legitimate reasons for inegalitarian modes of distribution. Hochschild's qualitative study on distributive justice found <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> are inegalitarian in the economic domain but egalitarian in the political and social domains. Analyzing the data from the data sets listed above more or less confirmed that Hochschild was correct about Americans' attitudes in the economic and political domains. However, Americans are not social egalitarians. The analysis in this dissertation has found <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> believe it is perfectly just and fair for people to be given greater levels of respect and deference and to have higher social status if their jobs require great amounts of skill or if they make the most of the opportunities they had in life...|$|R

5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain.

After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed <b>that</b> <b>American</b> trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E

5|$|As World War II neared, Minton took a {{cautious}} position on United States involvement. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland {{to help finance}} its defense efforts. He also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the Allies or the Axis powers. He advocated and supported expanding the American military and believed <b>that</b> <b>American</b> entry into the war was inevitable, but should be delayed as long as possible. He {{voted in favor of}} the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States. In his final year in office, there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions and the Supreme Court, but neither happened.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself.

5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A.

He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E
