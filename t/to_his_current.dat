5|$|Despite {{offers from}} Bologna and Milan, Buffon {{began his career}} with the Parma youth system in 1991, at the age of 13. During his time in the youth academy, he {{initially}} played in several out-field positions, in particular as a midfielder, before switching <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> position of goalkeeper. His idol Thomas N'Kono inspired this change of position due to his notable goalkeeping performances for Cameroon at the 1990 World Cup in Italy; as a result, when both of the Parma youth team's keepers suddenly suffered injuries, Buffon was called upon due to his interest, height and physical attributes. He quickly adapted to this role, and within two weeks he had been promoted to first keeper of the Parma youth team. Ermes Fulgoni, the academy's goalkeeping coach, would soon become a mentor to the young goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define {{him and his}} narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E
5|$|He {{converted}} from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, {{along with several}} other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, {{at the suggestion of}} the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his release point <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> low angle. Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, he cut his ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0–1 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.|$|E

5|$|He sported one-off helmet designs four times. For the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, a title decider with Mika Häkkinen, he {{replaced}} the German flag with a chequered flag motif and reflective silver replacing the white areas. At the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, the German flag design {{was replaced with}} an Italian flag in honour of his team's home race. For the Brazilian Grand Prix race of 2006 (at the time intended to be his final Grand Prix), he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories. For the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet. The helmet, very similar <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> helmet, included the year of his début to the present, and the years of his seven World titles. For the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 300th Grand Prix appearance, he wore a special platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.|$|E
5|$|In 1263 one of {{the more}} radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, {{resulting}} in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt {{in the second half of}} his reign, and was moved <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>current</b> tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised.|$|E

25|$|The first {{murder victim}} of Dennis Nilsen was {{identified}} in 2006 as 14-year-old Stephen Dean Holmes. Formal identification was confirmed via {{a combination of}} circumstantial evidence and by Nilsen identifying {{a photograph of the}} youth shown to him by police (all bone fragments found at Melrose Avenue had been destroyed).
