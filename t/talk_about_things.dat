25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

He later returned to Kentucky to attend Ryle High School for one semester. Hutcherson played on the high school's soccer team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for football and tennis. At the age of 13, he participated in a triathlon. He later said of his schooling experiences, [...] "I know it's something kids have to deal with every single day but getting {{up at the same time}} every day and having to listen to teachers <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> I could learn so much more easily on my own, I hated it." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Miles' first {{relationships}} is with Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes), which develops from a friendship. Miles is left upset over his foster child Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues). His emotional state {{has an effect}} on Kirsty and she kisses him. Hayes told TV Week that as Kirsty's feelings [...] "take over in the moment", Miles is left surprised because he had been harbouring feelings for her too. Hayes also said Miles did not want to scare Kirsty away and they agree to take their relationship slowly. Hayes later said that Miles and Kirsty's relationship worked so well because [...] "they <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> and they're mature about their relationship." [...] Kirsty decides that she needs to raise money for her husband Kane Phillips' (Sam Atwell) trial. She secretly begins work as an escort behind Miles' back. Hayes' explained Kirsty was [...] "terrified" [...] that Miles would find out and hated lying to him, but [...] "has no choice." [...] When Miles discovers the truth about Kirsty's escorting, he feels [...] "totally betrayed" [...] and ends their relationship. However, when Kirsty nearly sleeps with a client, Miles comes to her aid. At this point Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) tries to kiss Miles, as the two previously shared a connection. However, Miles defends Kirsty when he learns Leah had argued with Kirsty over her deceit. The state of their relationship remained troubled, though Hayes correctly predicted the couple would reunite.|$|E
2500|$|During a Playboy {{interview}} in 1992, Williams {{was asked whether}} he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, [...] "There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things,</b> if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If I stop trying, I get afraid." [...] While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.|$|E

My music has no politics." [...] She has visited the White House six times since 1976, under both Republican and Democratic presidents, and in her autobiography, she said her father was a Republican and her mother a Democrat. When asked about same-sex marriage by USA Today in November 2010, she replied, [...] "I'm still an old Bible girl. God said you need to be a woman and man, but everybody to their own."

2500|$|After {{the release}} of her second album Mistaken Identity in 2004, Delta {{reflected}} that the album was rushed – written and recorded {{while she was still}} recovering from chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Goodrem remarked that she felt overexposed and claimed, [...] "I'd burnt myself out. By the end of 'Mistaken Identity' I thought, 'This is nothing of what I am. I know I can do all of this a lot better'." [...] After a period of being angry, Delta felt she was healed and embraced herself and being in the public eye. Therefore, she started developing a new album, stating, [...] "For a while I was writing songs for this album I didn't want to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things,</b> so I didn't want to write about them either. [...] "I had to get over a couple of things. My parents divorced, there was a lot going on. But now I truly am inspired again. I feel regenerated. I feel I've got my energy back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} Stephen Huvane stated [...] "Personally, she’s {{not comfortable}} with being Janet in public [...] When she’s performing, that’s a different thing. We always planned that when the album came out, we would do the proper promotion." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam commented, [...] "Between albums she likes to go live life, recharge her batteries {{and be able to}} share her experiences. It not only raises her artistic level, she's able to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> she's going through -- and other people can relate. That's {{one of the things that}} allows her to connect truly with the fans." [...] Prior to promotion, Jackson performed a medley of [...] "All for You", [...] "Rhythm Nation", and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Surprise guest Justin Timberlake arrived to perform a duet version of [...] "Rock Your Body," [...] which ended in Jackson's breast being accidentally exposed. The incident resulted in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission enforcing massive fines on conglomerates involved with the broadcast, including CBS, Viacom, and MTV; who then blacklisted Jackson on many radio formats and music channels worldwide as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Kimiko and Miho are in {{the same}} diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has {{disrupted}} his attempts to destroy Ping. Miho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika. Dom is also there to talk with Kimiko. [...] After rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things.</b> Miho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area.

[...] Piro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner.
