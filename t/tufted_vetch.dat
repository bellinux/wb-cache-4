50|$|Vicia cracca (<b>tufted</b> <b>vetch,</b> cow vetch, bird vetch, blue vetch, boreal vetch), is {{a species}} of vetch native to Europe and Asia. It occurs on other continents as an {{introduced}} species, including North America, where {{it is a common}} weed. It often occurs in disturbed habitats, including old-fields and roadside ditches.|$|E
50|$|The queen emerges {{early in}} the spring; the males emerge later, in late May to early June. Its food sources are {{flowering}} plants such as clover (males especially often visit white clover), <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch,</b> knapweed, and others. In the spring, the emerging queens frequently fly to flowers such as deadnettles, sallows, blackthorns, and dandelions.|$|E
50|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} on {{various members of}} the pea family in late May and June, most {{commonly}} meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), bitter vetch (Lathyrus linifolius), <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia cracca) and birds-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The larvae are green and well camouflaged on their food plant. Pupation takes place at the end of July in surrounding scrub and it is this stage which overwinters.|$|E
50|$|The {{village of}} West Bexington {{provides}} access to the Chesil Beach. The West Bexington nature reserve {{is one of the}} Dorset Wildlife Trust's few coastal reserves. It is internationally important because of the rare vegetated shingle habitat that thrives here (Rock Samphire, Sea Beet, Sea Campion, Sea Kale, Tree Mallow, <b>Tufted</b> <b>Vetch,</b> Wild Carrot, Wild Parsnip, Woody Nightshade, Yellow Horned Poppy and Yellow Iris).|$|E
50|$|In our time, {{the common}} vetch (V. sativa) has also risen to prominence. Together with broad bean cultivars such as horse bean or field bean, the FAO {{includes}} {{it among the}} 11 most important pulses in the world. The main usage of the common vetch is as forage for ruminant animals, both as fodder and legume, {{but there are other}} uses, as <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch,</b> V. cracca is grown as a mid-summer pollen source for honeybees.|$|E
50|$|This {{butterfly}} flies from May to August. The larvae feed on {{species of}} vetch, often meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis) and <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia cracca). The males fly around near the host plants waiting for females to arrive. The females {{lay their eggs}} singly on {{the leaves of the}} host plant. The caterpillars have glands which secrete a sugary fluid that attracts ants and the presence of these protects the larvae from predators.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of meadows on the floodplain of the River Ray, {{and it is}} a stronghold for rare species because heavy clay soils and frequent flooding makes arable farming difficult. The meadows are managed by traditional farming methods, and areas of medieval ridge and furrow still survive. In the summer, drier areas have displays of wild flowers such as black knapweed, meadowsweet and <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch.</b> The site supports a small breeding population of lapwings and curlews, and the Trust has created many new ponds and ditches to assist birds and invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Rich {{wetlands}} occur {{especially at}} {{the east of the}} moors and have species mixes arising in part out of the effects of a limestone understratum dominated by purple moor-grass with, in less-grazed areas, bog-myrtle (Myrica gale), and in more-grazed areas, cross-leaved heath and tormentil, with sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), compact rush (Juncus conglomeratus), sneezewort (Achillea ptramica), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre) and wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), and limestone indicators including carnation, glaucous and flea sedges (Carex panicea, C. flacca and C. pulicaris), fen bedstraw (Galium uliginosum), <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia cracca) and moss (Hylocomium splendens).|$|E
50|$|Rarer {{sand dune}} {{vegetation}} such as Babington's Orache (Atriplex glabriuscula) and Isle of Man cabbage (Coincya monensis monensis) have been recorded, together with typical sand dune wild flowers, including European marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), lyme grass (Leymus arenarius), kidney vetch, <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch,</b> common restharrow (Ononis repens), European searocket (Cakile maritima), sea campion (Silene maritima), prickly saltwort (Kali turgida), Scottish bluebell (Campanula rotundifolia), bird's-foot trefoil, ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), sea mayweed (Tripleurospermum maritimum) and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). Plants such as lyme grass were {{so important in}} stabilising sand dunes that during the 17th-century reign of William III, the Scottish Parliament passed a law protecting it.|$|E
50|$|Since 1997, Malören {{has been}} a nature reserve {{covering}} 182 hectares (450 acres). Vegetation on the rock-strewn island {{is reported to be}} gradually increasing. Mountain ash are taking root {{and there are plenty of}} sea peas, <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch</b> and fireweed. Rarer species include sleepy primrose and southern adderstongue. The island is even more interesting for birdlife, located as it is at the south end of the archipelago. It is used both as a resting place and for nesting. Arctic terns abound but there are also black-legged kittiwakes, Arctic skuas, large and small plovers, ruddy turnstones and redshanks as well as many of species of gull.|$|E
5000|$|Vicia benghalensis is {{a species}} of vetch known by the common names purple vetch and reddish <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch.</b> It is native to {{southern}} Europe, North Africa, and nearby islands, and it is utilized elsewhere in agriculture and may {{be present in the}} wild as an introduced species. It is an annual herb with a climbing stem which is coated in hairs, often densely, making the plant appear silvery white. Each leaf is made up of several pairs of elongated leaflets which measure up to 3 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a one-side raceme of several dark reddish purple flowers. Each flower has a densely hairy calyx of sepals and a tubular corolla between one and two centimeters in length. The fruit is a flat, hairy legume pod up to 3.5 centimeters long containing multiple seeds.|$|E
50|$|William Boyd was an American immunochemist and {{biochemist}} {{who became}} {{famous for his}} research on the genetics of race in the 1950s. During the 1940s, Boyd and Karl O. Renkonen independently discovered that lectins react differently to various blood types, after finding that the crude extracts of the lima bean and <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch</b> agglutinated the red blood cells from blood type A but not blood types B or O. This ultimately led to the disclosure of thousands of plants that contained these proteins. In order to examine racial differences and the distribution and migration patterns of various racial groups, Boyd systematically collected and classified blood samples from around the world, leading to his discovery that blood groups are not influenced by the environment, and are inherited. In his book Genetics and the Races of Man (1950), Boyd categorized the world population into 13 distinct races, based on their different blood type profiles and his idea that human races are populations with differing alleles. One of the most abundant information sources regarding inheritable traits linked to race remains the study of blood groups.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor´s work {{is focused}} on the {{climbing}} legumes. Literature review summarizes the importance and ecological requirements of species of meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis) and <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia cracca) and describes vegetation types with the occurrence of climbing legumes. Legumes are excellent forage, but they also contain some antinutritional substances and are often attacked by pests and diseases. Production of seed is difficult because of uneven ripening, dehiscent pods, seed dormancy and hard seeds. In the practical part were at selected localities conducted botanical images. These localities were compared with each other in terms of vegetation composition. On the localities were collected pods of monitored species. Seeds were after shelling used to determine seedling and germination...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis are {{climbing}} legumes meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis) and <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia cracca). The literature search defines watched kinds of legumes and their occurence in permanent grassland. There is summarized seed growing of legumes because of its problematic production. Legumes are valuable components of grassland especially thanks to fixation of nitrogen and high capacity of proteins. The practical part is focused on observation of floristic compilation of watched locations for three years. Particular locations were compared {{from the point of}} view of changes in land management and weather. Pods and seeds of observed kinds were collected and evaluated in single years. Experiments of seed's field germination were done after different period from picking and in case of various treatment...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted from 1989 to 1991 to evaluate several sulfonylurea herbicides, glyphosate and clopyralid {{for the control}} of bunchberry and other hexazinone tolerant weeds in lowbush blueberry. Broadcast applications of chlorosulfuron, metsulfuron and glyphosate reduced bunchberry densities at all application dates, though crop damage and subsequent yield reductions were unacceptable. Glyphosate was very effective in controlling {{a large number of}} plant species when applied as a spot spray treatment. Tribenuron and DPX R 9674 were effective in suppressing bunchberry stem densities at all application dates, without major adverse effects on blueberry, and also controlled a large number of hexazinone tolerant weeds when applied as a spot spray treatment. Clopyralid, at rates as low as 100 g a. i. ha$ sp{- 1 }$, was very effective as a broadcast treatment for the control of <b>tufted</b> <b>vetch,</b> although problems with crop tolerance and yield reductions were evident in some instances. Clopyralid did not control a large number of hexazinone tolerant species when applied as a spot spray treatment...|$|E
