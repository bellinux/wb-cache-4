40|$|Within firms {{innovation}} is largely dependent on individual-level innovativeness by employed inventors working in R&D. In contradiction to Dutch employed inventors, German employed inventors receive financial rewards for patented inventions according to strict guidelines in national patent law. Scholars {{have stated that}} motivational factors such as financial rewards affect <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> output of employed inventors. In this study the effect of individual remuneration guidelines in national patent on <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> output of German and Dutch employed inventors has been assessed. In order to obtain data, R&D employees in high-tech sectors filled out online questionnaires. The data was statistically analysed using a multivariate regression model. By applying this method the effect of multiple factors on <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> output of employed inventors could be analysed. Contrary to the expected effect of motivational factors on the actual output of employed inventors it is mainly the employee’s position in the firm that positively affects the innovativeness of employed inventors.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>inventive</b> {{problems}} may {{be located in}} different stage of design process. For example, the problem is identified in the stage of conceptual design. The engineers must solve the problem using some methods or tools in TRIZ and generate solutions. The solutions are {{then returned to the}} conceptual design stage and original concept of the product must be changed or redesigned. The following stages, embodiment and detailed design must also be changed. After the chain reaction to the solutions of <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> problem <b>the</b> new design or new document is formed. If <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> problem is in the stage of embodiment design, the original embodiment and the detailed design must be changed. If the problem is in the stage of detailed design, the only original detailed design must be changed. As a result the main design process and the training process are connected seamlessly which is a new type of redesign process.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} that a claimed innovation have an inventive step {{in order to}} be granted a patent presents particular difficulties for biotechnology. It is notoriously difficult to predict what an examiner or the court will deem to be inventive, creating uncertainty for biotechnologists. Despite the difficulties in predicting the application of <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> step, <b>the</b> requirement can play an important gatekeeper role, limiting the number of biotechnology innovations that receive patents to those whose contribution outweighs the social costs of imposing a monopoly. This paper will discuss how <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> step requirement has been interpreted for biotechnology papers, and the role that the requirement plays in the biotechnology industry, comparing it to the other patent requirements. It argues that despite the difficulties in application of <b>the</b> <b>inventive</b> step, and <b>the</b> difficulties it creates for biotechnologists, biotechnology as an industry benefits from its imposition as without it there is the risk of patents on products or processes that are obvious developments hindering future research...|$|R

In this investigation, we developed a transtibial <b>prosthesis</b> <b>comprising</b> an artificial gastrocnemius mechanism as well as a powered ankle-foot device. A pilot study was conducted with a bilateral transtibial amputee walking at a self-selected speed. The trial compared muscle electromyography and metabolic cost data for the amputee while using the active gastrocnemius prosthesis and a conventional Flex-Foot prosthesis. The experimental data showed that the compensation for ankle-foot and gastrocnemius function offered by the active device resulted in a reduced metabolic cost for the amputee participant...|$|R
