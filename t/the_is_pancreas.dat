30|$|It {{appears that}} the {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> more anterior in the Flash 3 D reconstructions (Fig.  2 c). This might also <b>be</b> caused by <b>the</b> Gibbs artefact that ‘absorbs’ {{a part of the}} counts in the pancreas. Therefore, it seems that <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> visualized more anteriorly compared to the images reconstructed with Hybrid Recon.|$|R

2500|$|Trypsin <b>is</b> {{produced}} as <b>the</b> inactive zymogen trypsinogen in the <b>pancreas.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> stimulated by cholecystokinin, {{it is then}} secreted into {{the first part of}} the small intestine (the duodenum) via the pancreatic duct. Once in the small intestine, the enzyme enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen into trypsin by proteolytic cleavage. [...] Auto catalysis does not happen with trypsin, as [...] trypsinogen is a poor substrate, therefore enzymatic damage to <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> avoided.|$|R
30|$|Experience with resections of {{pancreas}} for {{the isolated}} metastatic lesions {{is very limited}} [3, 6 – 8, 10, 11, 13, 14], because metastatic disease to <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> considered to exist commonly with metastasis to other organs such as the liver and lung [1]. As a result, the value of surgical treatment to the metastasis to <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> unclear, {{and there are no}} guidelines or recommended strategies regarding the appropriate management of such lesions.|$|R

40|$|Cystic tumors of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> less {{frequent}} than solid lesions {{and are often}} detected incidentally, {{as many of these}} lesions are small and asymptomatic. However, they may be associated with pancreatitis or have malignant potential. With advancements in diagnostic imaging, cystic lesions of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> being detected with increasing frequency. Many lesions can cause a pancreatic cyst, most being non-neoplastic while approximately 10 % are cystic tumors, ranging from benign to highly malignant tumors. With increasing experience it is becoming clear that the prevalence of pseudocyst among cystic lesions of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> lower than usually presumed. A presumptive diagnosis of pseudocyst based on imaging appearance alone can cause a diagnostic error, and neoplastic cysts of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> particularly susceptible to this misdiagnosis, which can result in inappropriate treatment. Cystic tumors of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> formed by serous or mucinous structures showing all stages of cellular differentiation. According to the WHO classification, they can <b>be</b> subdivided on <b>the</b> basis of their histological type and biological behavior into benign tumors, borderline tumors, and malignant tumors. Cystic pancreatic tumors can be subdivided into peripheral (serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystic tumors, solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms, cystic islet cell tumors), which do not communicate with the main pancreatic duct, and ductal tumors (mucinous tumor), according to their site of origin. On the basis of imaging criteria alone, it can be very difficult to differentiate non-tumoral cystic lesions from neoplastic ones. The management of these patients is complex, and it is important to correlate imaging findings with knowledge of the patient’s symptoms and of the natural history and predictors of malignancy in pancreatic cysts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONMetastatic tumors of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> {{uncommon}} {{and rarely}} detectable clinically. Metastases to <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> rare. We present {{a patient with}} pancreatic metastases from a leiomyosarcoma of the uterus and review the literature about the clinical features of pancreatic metastasis and its surgical management. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 40 -year-old woman, who underwent hysterectomy, left oophorectomy, omentectomy and lymp node dissection for leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. At the follow up, the patient complained of non-specific abdominal discomfort. Preoperative diagnosis were pancreatic pseudocyst, cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. At laparotomy, a cystic mass <b>was</b> found in <b>the</b> tail of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> which <b>was</b> invased to <b>the</b> transverse colon mesenterium and the spleen. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and transverse colon resection <b>was</b> performed. Histologically, <b>the</b> tumor <b>was</b> evaluated as poorly differentiated leiomyosarcoma. DISCUSSIONMetastatic lesions of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> uncommon and less than 2 % of all pancreatic malignancies. However a few cases of leiomyosarcoma with metastases to <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> have <b>been</b> reported in <b>the</b> literature. Before deciding that the lesion in <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>was</b> metastasis, primary leiomyosarcoma of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> had to <b>be</b> ruled out. Histologically, leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas contains interlacing spindle cells {{with varying degrees of}} atypia and pleomorphism. The surgical approach to the pancreatic metastases must be aimed complete excision of the tumor with a wide negative margin of clear tissue and maximum preservation of pancreatic remnant if possible. CONCLUSIONIn the absence of widespread metastatic disease, aggressive surgical approach with negative margins must be aimed...|$|R
40|$|A 68 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) resected curatively 12 years previously was admitted to our department for scrutiny of pancreatic tumors. Various imaging studies demonstrated heterogeneously well-enhanced masses in the head and tail of the pancreas. The well-enhanced mass in the head of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>was</b> connected with <b>the</b> tumor thrombus in the portal vein. To differentially diagnose the multiple pancreatic lesions, we performed endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB). Histopathologic findings of <b>the</b> EUS-FNAB specimens <b>were</b> {{similar to those of the}} renal clear cell carcinoma previously resected. The patient underwent a surgical operation with segmental resection of the portal vein with the preoperative diagnosis of RCC metastasis to the pancreas with intraportal growth. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed that the masses in <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>were</b> multiple pancreatic metastases with intraportal tumor thrombus of RCC. <b>The</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> a rare target for metastasis. This is a rare case of pancreatic metastasis from RCC with intraportal extension, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first preoperatively definitely diagnosed case using EUS-FNAB...|$|R

30|$|In Flash 3 D reconstructions, the {{intensity}} {{in the tail}} and {{the edge of the}} head of the pancreas (close to <b>the</b> kidney) <b>was</b> lower compared to that in the other parts of the pancreas.

In Hybrid Recon, the position of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> similar in SPECT and CT, and <b>the</b> intensity <b>was</b> more homogeneous across the entire pancreas. For a high number of iterations (18 iterations, 32 subsets) in Hybrid Recon, {{the intensity}} distribution in <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>was</b> more homogeneous with the MAP reconstructions compared with the OSEM 3 D reconstruction.|$|R
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} is an autoimmune disease which <b>is</b> due to <b>the</b> lack of β cells.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> an endodermal organ {{found in}} all {{vertebrates}} with two different functional components that <b>are</b> essential for <b>the</b> homeostatic regulation of glucose and food digestion. <b>The</b> exocrine <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> composed of acinar and duct cells involved in the production and transport of digestive enzymes into the gut, whereas the endocrine compartment regulates the production and secretion of peptide hormones into the bloodstream. In higher vertebrates, there are five endocrine cell types that cluster as the islets of Langerhans. <b>The</b> hormonal expression <b>is</b> specific to each cell type: glucagon (α cells), insulin (β cells), somatostatin (δ cells), ghrelin (ε cells), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP cells) (Ali 1985).|$|R
30|$|A lymphoepithelial cyst (LEC) is a lesion {{that most}} {{commonly}} {{appears on the}} lateral neck and the parotid gland.

LEC of <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> a rare lesion and its histogenesis remains unclear. In particular, LEC with sebaceous glands is extremely rare [1]; sebaceous glands in a non-skin organ are often found in ectodermal organs, but they are rarely found in endodermal organs such as the pancreas.
