That season they {{defeated}} {{both of the}} top two 2008–09 year-end teams (Oak Hill Academy and Findlay Prep). Northland was undefeated and ranked #1 in the nation by ESPN HS before <b>they</b> <b>fell</b> in the 2010 OHSAA regional finals to Lincoln High School.

Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios (or, {{according to the}} Alexiad, his brother John, who commanded the right wing) rallied his men and led forth the second line. This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, <b>they</b> <b>fell</b> upon the Immortals, who also panicked and fled, abandoning their posts. Although they suffered some casualties from Bryennios's pursuing men, most managed to escape well {{to the rear of}} Alexios's army.|$|E

In January 2016, Moore announced the series would end at issue 42.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} St. Augustine proved even more arduous and {{dangerous}} than the journey out.

They encamped that night on a bit of dry ground, where a fire was built to dry their soaking garments, but the heavy rain began again.|$|R
