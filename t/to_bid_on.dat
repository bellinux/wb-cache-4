5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys has been talking about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa <b>to</b> <b>bid</b> <b>on</b> him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why he did it.|$|E
40|$|Clients engage {{consultant}} quantity surveyors or cost {{engineers to}} perform project cost estimates before calling for tender submissions. This experimental study examines {{the impact of}} releasing the clients’ pre-tender cost estimates prior <b>to</b> <b>bidding</b> <b>on</b> student subjects’ <b>bidding</b> behavioural patterns, and the extents <b>to</b> which their <b>bidding</b> tends <b>to</b> agree with the behavioural patterns proposed by Milgrom and Weber’s theory. The {{results show that the}} provision of clients’ pre-tender cost estimates prior <b>to</b> <b>bidding</b> does affect bidders’ bidding behaviour. Bidders with access to the clients’ pre-tender cost estimates prior <b>to</b> <b>bidding,</b> <b>on</b> average, recorded lower bids than those with no access to the estimate. However, the lower average bids do not result in statistically significant lower winning bids. These findings provide evidence in support of Milgrom and Weber’s theory, demonstrating the practicality of an experimental approach using student subjects for testing theories in building economics research. The practical implication is that construction clients would need to consider their information policy on releasing pre-tender cost estimates to enhance efficiency in their procurement for construction services...|$|R

On September 14, the IOC recognized seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo—which had been put forward by their respective NOCs <b>to</b> <b>bid.</b> <b>On</b> October 1, 2007, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid the required fee of USD 150,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Acceptance Procedure.

On January 14, 2008, the seven Applicant cities returned documents, known as the Application Files, containing the answers and guarantees requested by the 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure, which provided to the IOC an overview of each city's project. The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group for months and served as the basis to the shortlist of Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid on June 4, 2008, becoming Candidate cities during a meeting of the IOC Executive Board at the 2008 SportAccord Convention in Athens, Greece.|$|E

In 1847, Harbach left Massachusetts to accept an appointment at the CC as chief surveyor of the road. In November 1848, the company finally issued a request for proposals to build the first leg of its line from Cleveland to Columbus, Ohio. Alfred Kelley, an attorney and former state legislator, canal commissioner, banker, and railroad builder, was president of the railway, and he, too, knew Stone well from his railroading days in the east. Kelley and the CC managers reached out to Harbach, Stone, and Witt, and asked them <b>to</b> <b>bid</b> <b>on</b> the project.
