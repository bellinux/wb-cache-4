5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>ontological</b> {{argument}} {{may have}} been implicit {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream view is that <b>the</b> <b>ontological</b> argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
5|$|In his {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>ontological</b> argument, Leibniz attempted {{to demonstrate the}} coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. <b>The</b> <b>ontological</b> argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then {{he should be able to}} create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render <b>the</b> <b>ontological</b> argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to reform the view of Vygotsky. In the reinterpretations of Vygotsky's {{developmental}} theory, his theories about <b>the</b> development in <b>ontological</b> dimension have been overlooked and Vygotsky has been viewed as cognitive psychologist. How did Vygotsky treat <b>the</b> development in <b>ontological</b> dimension? What meanings does Vygotsky's theory about <b>the</b> development in <b>ontological</b> dimension suggest? This article describes how Vygotsky treated <b>the</b> development in <b>ontological</b> dimension by examining Vygotsky's studies on defectology. And I find the unfinished project of Vygotsky as a Marxist in his defectology...|$|R
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. <b>The</b> <b>ontological</b> argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of <b>the</b> <b>ontological</b> argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E

5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. <b>The</b> <b>ontological</b> stance towards qualia {{in the case of}} non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{conducted}} a representational {{analysis of a}} set of business process and business rule modeling languages by using the well-known Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) representation model.

We demonstrate that a combination of BPMN and R 2 ML (rBPMN) offers <b>the</b> highest <b>ontological</b> completeness among <b>the</b> languages studied...|$|R

5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and <b>the</b> <b>ontological</b> status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{concept of}} <b>ontological</b> {{security}} has received increased {{attention in the}} security studies literature {{over the past ten}} years. This article develops a critical perspective toward ontological security and its mobilization by IR scholars, arguing that substantive ethical and political resources are produced by resisting <b>the</b> terms of <b>ontological</b> security/insecurity. It argues that <b>the</b> aspiration to <b>ontological</b> security, to contiguous and stable narratives of selfhood, can (violently) obscure the ways in which such narratives are themselves implicated in power relations. Furthermore, it argues that attempts to order political life into an ontological/security episteme disciplines or marginalizes modes of subjectivity which resist <b>the</b> closure of <b>ontological</b> security-seeking strategies. <b>The</b> article engages queer figurations of subjectivity as mobilized by Judith Butler, Donna Haraway, and Jack Halberstam, as well as examples from anti-militarist social movements, to demonstrate traditions which refuse and resist <b>the</b> framework of <b>ontological</b> security. It does this both in order to highlight particular practices and strategies that are written out by an epistemology oriented around ontological security/insecurity, and to show how a resistance to such ordering can enliven political action in various ways...|$|R
25|$|Beginning at Bec, Anselm {{composed}} dialogues and treatises with {{a rational}} and philosophical approach, sometimes {{causing him to}} be credited as the founder of Scholasticism.
