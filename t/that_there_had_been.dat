5|$|Sir Archibald Geikie (1835–1924) was {{the first}} to {{recognise}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> multiple glaciations, and his 1863 paper On the glacial drift of Scotland was a landmark in the emergent theories of glaciation.

5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested {{that it may have}} been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility.

5|$|At {{the time}} the dimes were released, {{relations}} with the USSR were deteriorating, and Sinnock's initials, JS, were deemed by some to refer to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, placed there by a communist sympathizer. Once these rumors reached Congress, the Mint sent out press releases debunking this myth. Despite the Mint's denial, there were rumors into the 1950s <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a secret deal at the Yalta Conference to honor Stalin on a U.S. coin. The controversy was given fresh life in 1948 with the posthumous release of Sinnock's Franklin half dollar, which bears his initials JRS.|$|E
5|$|In early 1801, Adams {{had sent}} Thomas Jefferson a brief note after {{returning}} to Quincy to which Jefferson did not respond. In 1804, Abigail wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon {{the death of his}} daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses is London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from <b>that,</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.|$|E

Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith had not made contact (and thus the goal should have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a push by O'Leary. After consulting his linesman, the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew why they had protested, and TV replays confirm that Smith made contact.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners.

Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} dogged by {{financial}} controversy with the Australians accused by the British press of being {{interested only in}} money. The allegations were refuted by the Australian press but it later became clear, when an England team arrived in Australia the following winter, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a financial dispute between Alexander and the English team manager James Lillywhite, resulting in the two teams at first boycotting each other. The dispute was never evident while Murdoch's team was in England as they completed all their scheduled fixtures, winning eighteen matches and losing seven with seven drawn.|$|E

The government of Bahrain maintained that trials were fair.

5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a variety of stories {{about the fate of}} the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|Buffon {{transferred}} from Parma to Juventus on 3 July 2001 for €52million, along with former Parma teammate Lilian Thuram, and was handed the number 1 shirt {{as the starting}} goalkeeper, replacing Edwin van der Sar, who was sold to Fulham. Buffon later said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> an initial possibility for him to join Roma, but they signed Ivan Pelizzoli instead, and although negotiations were ongoing with Barcelona, he chose Juventus because his father convinced him he {{would be likely to}} achieve his ambition of winning the Scudetto. This transfer fee made Buffon Juventus's most expensive purchase ever, a record which was only broken in 2016 by the acquisition of Gonzalo Higuaín.|$|E

5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so {{it would be interesting to}} see what unfolded between them.|$|E
5|$|Finland placed {{second on}} the table, {{collecting}} four gold medals amongst a total of eleven. Clas Thunberg won five of their medals, achieving a medal {{in each of the}} speed skating events he took part in; collecting three gold medals, one silver and one bronze. Eight of the competing nations achieved at least one gold medal, with only Belgium and the hosts, France, medalling without winning a gold medal. One medal was reallocated in 1974; during the games, Thorleif Haug of Norway had been awarded the bronze medal in the ski jumping, along with his three gold medals. A Norwegian historian discovered <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a scoring error, and an American, Anders Haugen had actually finished in third place. As Haug had died in 1934, his daughter presented Haugen, aged 83, with his medal.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government {{announced}} it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try {{to determine whether it}} properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions.

The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a Royal Commission, be held.
