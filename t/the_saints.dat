2500|$|Charteris started {{retiring}} from writing books following 1963's <b>The</b> <b>Saint</b> in <b>the</b> Sun. The next book to carry Charteris's name, 1964's Vendetta for <b>the</b> <b>Saint,</b> {{was written by}} science fiction author Harry Harrison, who had worked on <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> comic strip, after which Charteris edited and revised the manuscript. Between 1964 and 1983, another 14 Saint books would be published, credited to Charteris but written by others. In his introduction to <b>the</b> first, <b>The</b> <b>Saint</b> on TV, Charteris called these volumes a team effort in which he oversaw selection of stories, initially adaptations of scripts written for the 1962–1969 TV series <b>The</b> <b>Saint,</b> and with Fleming Lee writing the adaptations (other authors took over from Lee). Charteris and Lee collaborated on two <b>Saint</b> novels in <b>the</b> 1970s, <b>The</b> <b>Saint</b> in Pursuit (based on a story by Charteris for <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> comic strip) and <b>The</b> <b>Saint</b> and <b>the</b> People Importers. The [...] "team" [...] writers were usually credited on the title page, if not the cover. One later volume, Catch <b>the</b> <b>Saint,</b> was an experiment in returning <b>The</b> <b>Saint</b> to his period, prior to World War II (as opposed to recent Saint books set in the present day). Several later volumes also adapted scripts from the 1970s revival TV series Return of <b>the</b> <b>Saint.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley {{kicked a}} 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan {{recovered}} the loose ball {{and reached the}} Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, <b>the</b> <b>Saints</b> scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26–10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Forté's two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by <b>the</b> <b>Saints.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>Saints</b> were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving <b>the</b> <b>Saints</b> the 26–18 win. The win {{marked the first time}} <b>the</b> <b>Saints</b> defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois.|$|E
