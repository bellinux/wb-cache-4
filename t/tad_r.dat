5|$|In state politics, the Mississippi Senate {{district}} map {{divides the}} city into three sections. The northern {{tip of the}} city is in the 31st State Senate District and seats Terry Clark Burton (R). A strip of the city from the southwest corner up to the northeast corner comprises part of the 32nd State Senate District and seats Sampson Jackson, II (D). The western and southeastern portions of the city lie in the 33rd State Senate District and seats Videt Carmichael (R). In the Mississippi House of Representatives districts, the city is divided into four districts. The southern and eastern portions of the city reside in House District 81 and are represented by Steven A. Horne (R). The city's core makes up the entirety of House District 82 and is represented by Wilbert L. Jones (D). Surrounding House District 82 is House District 83, represented by Greg Snowden (R). The western section of the city, along with a small section in the north, lie in House District 84 and are represented by <b>Tad</b> Campbell (<b>R).</b>|$|R
40|$|The ‘times to ignition’ {{theory has}} had limited {{use in the}} coal {{industry}} and virtually no use within Australia. The concept was originally applied {{to a range of}} Scottish coals to assess their spontaneous combustion propensity during transport in a 3 x 3 m shipping hold. This paper presents results from an investigation into the application of the times to ignition (tad) concept to a range of New South Wales coals using data obtained from adiabatic oven self-heating tests. There is a strong association between <b>tad</b> and the <b>R</b> 70 self-heating rate of a coal. The geographical location of the coal has a dramatic effect on the tad value as the initial coal temperature significantly changes the results by varying degrees...|$|R
40|$|A recent genome wide {{association}} study (GWAS) by LeMaire et al. {{found that}} two {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs), rs 2118181 and rs 10519177 in the FBN- 1 gene (encoding Fibrillin- 1), were associated with thoracic aortic dissection (TAD), non-dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), and thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection (TAAD); the largest effect was observed for the association of <b>rs</b> 2118181 with <b>TAD.</b> We investigated whether rs 2118181 and rs 10519177 were associated with TAD, TAA, and TAAD in the Yale study. The genotypes of rs 2118181 and rs 10519177 were determined for participants in the Yale study: 637 TAAD cases (140 TAD, 497 TAA) and 275 controls from the United States, Hungary, and Greece. The association of the genotypes with TAD, TAA and TAAD were assessed using logistic regression models adjusted for sex, age, study center and hypertension. In the Yale study, rs 2118181 was associated with TAD: compared with non-carriers, carriers of the risk allele had an unadjusted odds ratio for TAD of 1. 80 (95 % CI 1. 15 - 2. 80) and they had odds ratio for TAD of 1. 87 (95 % CI 1. 09 - 3. 20) after adjusting for sex, age, study center and hypertension. We did not find significant differences in aortic size, a potential confounder for <b>TAD,</b> between <b>rs</b> 2118181 risk variant carriers and non-carriers: mean aortic size was 5. 56 (95 % CI: 5. 37 - 5. 73) for risk variant carriers (CC+CT) and was 5. 48 (95 % CI: 5. 36 - 5. 61) for noncarriers (TT) (p =  0. 56). rs 2118181 {{was not associated with}} TAA or TAAD. rs 10519177 was not associated with TAD, TAA, or TAAD in the Yale study.

40|$|Type IV pili are {{virulence}} {{factors in}} various bacteria. Several subclasses of type IV pili {{have been described}} according to {{the characteristics of the}} structural prepilin subunit. Although type IVa pili have been implicated in the virulence of Ralstonia solanacearum, type IVb pili have not previously been described in this plant pathogen. Here, we report the characterization of two distinct tad loci in the R. solanacearum genome. The tad genes encode functions necessary for biogenesis of the Flp subfamily of type IVb pili initially described for the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. To determine the role of the <b>tad</b> loci in <b>R.</b> solanacearum virulence, we mutated the tadA 2 gene located in the megaplasmid genome that encodes a predicted NTPase previously reported to function as the energizer for Flp pilus biogenesis. Characterization of the tadA 2 mutant revealed that it was not growth impaired in vitro or in planta, produced wild-type levels of EPS galactosamine, and exhibited swimming and twitching motility comparable to the wild-type strain. However, the tadA 2 mutant was impaired in its ability to cause wilting of potato plants. This is the first report where type IVb pili in a phytopathogenic bacterium contribute significantly to plant pathogenesis. National Research Foundation of South Africa. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultrasound}} {{assessment of}} right ventricular (RV) function is often sub-optimal. The range of excursions of the mitral or tricuspid annulus measured in mm by 2 D or TM mode echocardiography {{has been shown}} to reflect the systolic function of both ventricles. MethodsWe studied a new technique based on a tissue tracking algorithm that is ultrasound beam angle independent for automated detection of tricuspid annular displacement (TAD) (QLAB, Philips Medical Imaging). Twenty six patients (pts) with pulmonary arterial hypertension (n= 13), heart failure (n= 9), valvulopathy (n= 3) or myocarditis (n= 1) were reffered for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and underwent a complete transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). MRI was performed on a 1. 5 T MR scanner. MRI RV ejection fraction (RVEF) was correlated by linear regression with TAD, peak systolic tricuspid annular velocity (Sa) and RV fractional area change (FAC). Sixteen pts (61. 5 %) exhibited right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVEF < 40 %). TTE was performed in 44 healthy subjects in order to assess normal TAD value. ResultsIn the pts group, MRI RVEF was positively correlated with <b>TAD</b> (<b>R</b> 2 = 0, 65; p< 0, 0001), Sa (R 2 = 0, 56; p< 0, 0001) and FAC (R 2 = 0, 39 p= 0, 0025). The strongest relation was observed with TAD. A value of TAD< 14 mm predicted right ventricular dysfunction with a sensitivity of 87. 5 % and a specificity of 90 %. Most of (90 %) healthy subjects exhibited TAD values exceeding this cut-off point (mean 16, 9 +/- 1, 64 mm, range 13, 3 to 24, 8 mm). Negative correlation was found between TAD and age (R 2 = 0, 36; p< 0, 0001). LimitationsThe echocardiographic and MRI parameters were not obtained simultaneously but at an interval of 24 hours. Our study is the first to correlate TAD with MRI RVEF. We conclude that TAD provides a simple, rapid, and non-invasive tool for assessing right ventricular systolic function...|$|E
