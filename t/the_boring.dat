5|$|Pietro Boyesen (1819–1882) was a Danish {{photographer}} who {{spent most of}} his professional life in Rome. Boyesen had a talent for composition and characterization. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>boring</b> studio portraits which were so common at the time, Boyesen would have his subjects pose outdoors in intimate Roman settings. By playing with the subjects clothes and their relationship to the surroundings, Boyesen would produce works presenting a somewhat timid but intimate charm.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{under the}} {{watershed}} includes {{part of the}} last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later volcanic eruptions, sediments from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt. Two dormant volcanoes from <b>the</b> <b>Boring</b> Lava Field are in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E

500|$|Being {{the onset}} of the flood tide, <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> is {{accompanied}} by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> has passed. <b>The</b> Severn <b>bore</b> is not a self-reinforcing solitary wave or soliton but rather a shock wave which is formed because the wave is travelling faster than the wave speed in water above <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> (see tidal bore for more details). The passing of <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> causes a churning of the water, and the myriads of tiny bubbles popping contributes much of the roaring sound made by <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b> <b>The</b> largest recorded <b>bore</b> was on 15 October 1966, when it reached a height of [...] at Stonebench.|$|R
5|$|Starting about 3million {{years ago}} and {{continuing}} {{at least through the}} late Pleistocene, extensional faulting of the Earth's crust led to eruption of small volcanoes in <b>the</b> <b>Boring</b> volcanic field. This field extended roughly from Portland and Tualatin on the west to Battle Ground, Washington, on the north to Sandy and Boring on the east. Two of these volcanoes, Mount Sylvania and Cook's Butte, are in the Tryon Creek watershed. The Mount Sylvania eruptions included ash plumes and lava flows that covered some of the Waverly Heights Formation and Columbia River basalts.|$|E
5|$|The Beckwourth Trail was the {{earliest}} predecessor of SR 70, {{which was a}} spur of the California Trail. This {{was followed by the}} railroad, mostly built on the route of the trail; a dirt road was needed for construction that was later converted into part of the present state highway. Construction on the highway began in 1928, which involved <b>the</b> <b>boring</b> of three tunnels. Previously, the road was signed as U.S. Route 40 Alternate, crossing the Sierra Nevada at a lower elevation than Donner Pass on US 40, now Interstate 80 (I-80). The road was renumbered SR 70 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Today, portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to a four-lane expressway, and even a freeway in a few locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} can {{be divided}} into two hydrologic areas with different infiltration rates. The northern area, comprising about 40percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of <b>the</b> <b>Boring</b> Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most of the rain that falls on the northern area percolates into the ground, and most of the rain that falls on the southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries. Rain that falls on the north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the base flow of the creek during dry periods.|$|E

50|$|The gauges {{are locked}} by {{twisting}} the knurled {{end of the}} handles, this action is performed to exert {{a small amount of}} friction on the telescopic portions of the gauge (the smaller diameter rods found at the T head of the gauge). To use, the gauge is inserted at a slight angle to <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> and gently locked to a size slightly larger than <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> while at that angle. Then, rocking the handle side-to-side, slowly move the handle across <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> to <b>the</b> other side. The rocking will first align the gauge with <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> axis and <b>the</b> act of moving the handle {{to the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> will bring it to <b>the</b> exact <b>bore</b> diameter.

40|$|An {{electric}} motor is described {{with a low}} speed shaft that rotates at a speed much slower {{than the speed of}} a high speed shaft.

25|$|Gradually {{it came to}} be {{suspected}} that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of vis viva. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace reviewed the two competing theories of vis viva and caloric theory. Count Rumford's 1798 observations of heat generation during <b>the</b> <b>boring</b> of cannons added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). Vis viva then started to be known as energy, after the term was first used in that sense by Thomas Young in 1807.|$|E

25|$|The {{boreholes}} on Funafuti at {{the site}} now called Darwin's Drill, {{are the result of}} drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs and the question as to whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on the structure and distribution of coral reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1911.

25|$|In Leon Festinger's {{cognitive}} dissonance experiment, {{participants were asked}} to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for the doing <b>the</b> <b>boring</b> task, therefore no dissonance.|$|E

50|$|Two key {{features}} of a tidal <b>bore</b> are <b>the</b> intense turbulence and turbulent mixing generated during <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> propagation, {{as well as its}} rumbling noise. The visual observations of tidal <b>bores</b> highlight <b>the</b> turbulent nature of the surging waters. <b>The</b> tidal <b>bore</b> induces a strong turbulent mixing in the estuarine zone, and the effects may be felt along considerable distances. The velocity observations indicate a rapid deceleration of the flow associated with the passage of <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> as well as large velocity fluctuations. A tidal bore creates a powerful roar that combines the sounds caused by the turbulence in <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> front and whelps, entrained air bubbles in <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> roller, sediment erosion beneath <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> front and of the banks, scouring of shoals and bars, and impacts on obstacles. <b>The</b> <b>bore</b> rumble is heard far away because its low frequencies can travel over long distances. The low-frequency sound is a characteristic feature of the advancing roller in which the air bubbles entrapped in the large-scale eddies are acoustically active and play the dominant role in the rumble-sound generation.|$|R
