5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, <b>traps</b> and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a carnivorous plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall <b>traps</b> of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan <b>Traps</b> flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the <b>traps</b> erupted over a period of 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone <b>traps</b> have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone <b>traps</b> can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone <b>traps</b> in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} emerald ash borer {{has not yet}} been detected, surveys are used to monitor for new infestations.

However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan <b>Traps</b> were created in only 1 million years about 66million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} rapid {{evaporative}} cooling method using a hybrid <b>trap</b> which {{is composed of}} a quadrupole magnetic <b>trap</b> and a one-beam optical dipole <b>trap.</b> It contains two kinds of evaporative coolings to reach the quantum degeneracy: initial radio-frequency (RF) enforced evaporative cooling in the quadrupole magnetic <b>trap</b> and further runaway evaporative cooling in the optical dipole <b>trap.</b> The hybrid <b>trap</b> {{does not require a}} very high power laser such as that in the traditional pure optical <b>trap,</b> but still has a deep <b>trap</b> depth and a large <b>trap</b> volume, and has better optical access than the normal magnetic <b>trap</b> like the quadrupole-Ioffe-configuration (QUIC) cloverleaf <b>trap.</b> A high <b>trap</b> frequency can be easily realized in the hybrid <b>trap</b> to enhance the elastic collision rate and shorten the evaporative cooling time.

40|$|We {{utilize the}} {{combination}} of two standard <b>trapping</b> techniques, a magnetic <b>trap</b> and an optical <b>trap</b> in a Raman setup, to propose a versatile and tunable <b>trap</b> for cold atoms. The created potential provides several advantages over conventional <b>trapping</b> potentials. One can easily convert the type of the <b>trap,</b> e. g., from a single well to a double well <b>trap.</b> Atoms in different internal states can be <b>trapped</b> in different <b>trap</b> types, thereby enabling the realization of experiments with multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates. Moreover, one can achieve variations of the <b>trapping</b> potential on small length scales without the need of microstructures. We present the potential surfaces for different setups, demonstrate their tunability, give a semi-analytical expression for the potential, and propose experiments which can be realized within such a <b>trap.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} when the Deccan <b>Traps</b> theory was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data.

Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept {{the idea that the}} mass extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan <b>Traps,</b> and these may have contributed to the extinctions.|$|E

5|$|Many Smilodon {{specimens}} {{have been}} excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore <b>traps.</b> Animals were accidentally {{trapped in the}} seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such <b>traps</b> are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the <b>trapping</b> of cold $^{ 87 }Rb$ atoms in a toroidal geometry using a radio frequency (rf) dressed quadrupole magnetic <b>trap</b> formed by superposing a strong rf-field on a quadrupole <b>trap.</b> This rf-dressed quadrupole <b>trap</b> has the minimum potential {{away from the}} quadrupole <b>trap</b> centre on a circular path which facilitates <b>trapping</b> in toroidal geometry. In these experiments, the laser cooled atoms were first <b>trapped</b> in a quadrupole <b>trap,</b> then cooled evaporatively using a weak rf-field, and finally <b>trapped</b> in an rf-dressed quadrupole <b>trap.</b> The radius of the toroid could be varied by varying {{the frequency of the}} dressing rf-field. It has also been demonstrated that a single rf source and an antenna can be used for the rf-evaporative cooling {{as well as for the}} rf-dressing of atoms. The atoms <b>trapped</b> in the toroidal <b>trap</b> may have applications in the realization of an atom gyroscope as well as in studying the quantum gases in low dimensions.

40|$|Optical <b>trapping</b> {{forces are}} {{dependent}} upon {{the difference between the}} <b>trap</b> wavelength and the extinction (scattering plus absorption) resonances of a <b>trapped</b> particle. This leads to a wavelength-dependent <b>trapping</b> force, which should allow for the optimization of optical tweezers systems, simply by choosing the best <b>trapping</b> wavelength for a given experiment. Although optical forces due to a near-resonant laser beam have been extensively studied for atoms, the situation for larger particles has not been explored experimentally. The ability to selectively <b>trap</b> certain particles with a given extinction peak may have many practical applications. Here, resonance-based <b>trapping</b> is investigated using nanoshells, particles with a dielectric core and metallic coating that exhibit tunable plasmon resonances, and with silica and polystyrene beads. A measure of the <b>trap</b> strength was realized for single particles <b>trapped</b> in three dimensions, and near-resonant <b>trapping</b> was investigated by measuring the <b>trap</b> strength as a function of <b>trap</b> wavelength. Since the resulting <b>trapping</b> is highly temperature dependent, this necessitated temperature measurements of single optically <b>trapped</b> particles. To make these measurements a new optical tweezer apparatus was designed and constructed; the apparatus has wavelength tunability and was used to study these resonance effects. Optical <b>trap</b> stiffness, which is analogous to the spring constant of a stable <b>trap,</b> is measured for <b>trapped</b> particles that exhibit either single or multiple extinction resonances. The applications of this apparatus are not limited to force spectroscopy. Other measurement systems and techniques could be easily implemented into the custom-built apparatus, allowing for the measurement of various properties of single optically <b>trapped</b> particles as a function of wavelength...|$|R

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficiency}} of collecting methods by structural characterisation of a neuropteroid community the authors carried out an investigation in a commercial apple orchard at Szigetcsép by using three different <b>trapping</b> techniques, Malaise <b>trap,</b> suction <b>trap</b> and light <b>trap.</b> Considering of the individuals of this community, the suction <b>trap</b> {{seems to be the}} most useful sampling device outrunning the material caught by light <b>trap</b> and especially those of Malaise <b>trap.</b> During the investigation the suction <b>trap</b> and light <b>trap</b> show the numbers of the species and individuals of Coniopterygidae, Hemerobiidae and Chrysopidae families in a similar way. To record snake flies, Raphidiidae, Malaise <b>trap</b> seems to be the most suitable sampling device while the light <b>trap</b> is the best for sponge flies, Sisyridae. Abundance of Hemerobius humulinus and Wesmaelius subnebulosus was underestimated by Malaise <b>trap</b> compared with the records of suction trap; however Micromus angulatus and Micromus variegatus were overestimated by Malaise <b>trap.</b> Comparing the results of light <b>trap</b> to suction <b>trap</b> Hemerobius humulinus, Wesmaelius subnebulosus and Chrysoperla carnea complex were underrepresented while Micromus angulatus, Micromus variegatus, Chrysopa formosa and Chrysopa phyllochroma were overestimated. Diversity profiles drawn by different sampling techniques show that the diversity of the suction <b>trap</b> samples, except for the beginning of the scale parameter, is significantly (p < 0. 01) lower in its total length from the values of light <b>trap</b> and Malaise <b>trap.</b> In the profile of plots of light <b>trap</b> and Malaise <b>trap</b> the diversity of the samples were not different in the species with medium and higher abundance. In conclusion, the sampling techniques used in the ecological investigations can determine the characteristics of neuropteroid communities. These results show that sampling devices have to be chosen cautiously according to the main aims and the interpretation of investigations...|$|R
