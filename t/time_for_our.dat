It was emotionally exhausting, {{and by the time}} we got around to the point where we were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E

We are really proud of all the music we’ve made together and look forward to getting together to smash out The Neon Handshake. The early 2000s were exciting times for British rock music. It was a special <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> bands, who toured together and forged strong friendships.

2500|$|Their life in Mexico was by all {{accounts}} an unhappy one. Without heroin and suffering from Benzedrine abuse, Burroughs began to pursue other men as his libido returned, while Vollmer, feeling abandoned, started to drink heavily and mock Burroughs openly. One night while drinking with friends at a party above the American-owned Bounty Bar in Mexico City, a drunk Burroughs allegedly took his handgun from his travel bag and told his wife [...] "It's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> William Tell act", {{even though they had}} never performed such an act previously. Vollmer, who was also drinking heavily and undergoing amphetamine withdrawal, obliged him by putting a highball glass on her head. Burroughs shot low and the bullet struck her, killing her almost immediately.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of the daily travel <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> sample is based on duration models, alternatively known as survival analysis. In the activity-based literature, duration models are used to analyse both the duration of daily activities and the activity pattern structure [25].

The additional exploration constraint—that no disjoint lattice assigned to the SPM can cross a bank boundary—ensures the effectiveness of our basic approach when M≥ 4 : this constraint significantly reduces the search space, typically yielding near-optimal results.|$|R
