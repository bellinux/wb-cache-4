5|$|The {{families}} of those executed continued to seek the overturning of the sentences and compensation, based on the irregularity of the processes used <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> their relatives. In 2004, they appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain, which rejected their application {{on the grounds that}} it did not have the power to deal with cases prior to December 1978, when the Constitution came into effect. In September 2005, the European Court of Human Rights rejected their petition on similar grounds: that Spain had not been a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights in 1975. In November 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> Txiki and Otaegui had violated their right to a fair trial and awarded €135,000 in compensation to their families. Flor Baena, the sister of José Humberto Baena, continued to campaign for her brother, stating that she wanted to clear his name, not financial compensation.|$|E

5|$|Garrow {{made much}} use of jury nullification {{to limit the}} {{punishment}} for his convicted clients, {{in a time when}} many crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction would result in the death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.|$|E
5|$|Shakur's {{attorneys}} {{sought a}} new trial {{on the grounds that}} one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's sequestration order. Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler's claim that the juror had violated the order. McGovern later sued Kunstler for defamation; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement. Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later learned from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> Shakur.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} use {{of the death penalty}} in Spain; {{following}} the death of Francisco Franco, two months later, no further executions took place. The 1978 Spanish Constitution largely abolished the death penalty, with the exception of limited cases in times of war, and these exceptions were abolished in 1995. In 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> two of those executed had violated their rights and awarded compensation to their families.|$|E

5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, McCain won {{re-election}} {{to a third}} Senate term; he {{prevailed in}} a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> the president on both the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction. Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform, although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.|$|E

5|$|John Rowan (July 12, 1773July 13, 1843) was a 19th-century {{politician}} and jurist from the U.S. state of Kentucky. Rowan's family moved from Pennsylvania to the Kentucky frontier {{when he was}} young. From there, they moved to Bardstown, Kentucky, where Rowan studied law with former Kentucky Attorney General George Nicholas. He was a representative to the state constitutional convention of 1799, but his promising political career was almost derailed when he killed {{a man in a}} duel stemming from a drunken dispute during a game of cards. Although public sentiment was against him, a judge found insufficient evidence against him <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> him of murder. In 1804, Governor Christopher Greenup appointed Rowan Secretary of State, and he went on to serve in the Kentucky House of Representatives and the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Several Einsatzgruppen leaders, {{including}} Ohlendorf, claimed at {{the trial}} to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews. To date no evidence {{has been found that}} such an order was ever issued. German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> the Einsatzgruppen leaders as accomplices to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the Einsatzgruppen had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as perpetrators of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.|$|E
5|$|The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges. The Senate {{refused to}} meet to hold an {{impeachment}} trial {{before the end of}} the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E

5|$|Checkmate is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Focusing {{on the subject of}} convictions by circumstantial evidence, the plot has a French baron and an American businessman vie for the affections of an heiress. She chooses the American and the French baron conspires with the heiress's aunt to take revenge. The American falls into their trap and is accused of stabbing the baron by the conspirators. The circumstantial evidence was enough <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> him and he is sent to prison. Through the aid of a homeless doppelgänger who looks like the fiancé, he is substituted in prison and the original forces a confession from the aunt. For his plot, the baron is convicted of perjury and sent to prison. Released on February 17, 1911, the film was a critical failure for its improbable plot and its prison substitution scene. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah Bunting III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even asked why Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. Bunting argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into {{an explanation for the}} abrupt resignation request. Grant's acceptance of the resignation indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since he was no longer a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though the Senate voted that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> Belknap since he was no longer Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted the resignation in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E
5|$|That summer Garfield {{suffered}} from jaundice and significant weight loss. He {{was forced to}} return home, where his wife nursed him back to health. While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, although he refused to politick with the delegates. He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment. During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extra-marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it. Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his frustration. In the meantime, he served on the court-martial of Fitz John Porter for his tardiness at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was convinced of Porter's guilt, and voted with his fellow generals <b>to</b> <b>convict.</b> The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, {{and by the end}} of it, Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General William S. Rosecrans.|$|E

5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} delayed {{due to the}} {{difficulties}} in bringing together witnesses, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and interpreters. The proceedings finally began in August 1828, with Judge James Duane Doty presiding. Wau-koo-kau and Man-ne-tah-peh-keh, the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family, were released {{due to a lack}} of witnesses, as were three Ho-Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats. Only two men, Wekau and Chickhonsic, were prosecuted. According to historian Patrick Jung, it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin, and that there was not enough evidence <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> Wekau and Chickhonsic. Despite this, the white and métis jury found them guilty. Judge Doty sentenced them to hang, as he was required to do by law. Their lawyer filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury had ignored the evidence, and so Doty suspended the death sentences.|$|E
5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for plea bargaining by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used <b>to</b> <b>convict</b> her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E
