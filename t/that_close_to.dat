25|$|The speed {{lines of}} gas turbine {{centrifugal}} compressors typically exhibit choke. This {{is a situation}} where the pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) with little or no change in flow. In most cases {{the reason for this is}} <b>that</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher pressure ratio turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} 1915-23 are {{regarded}} by Armenians {{and the vast}} majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings. Turkish authorities, however, maintain that the deaths were the result of a civil war coupled with disease and famine, with casualties incurred by both sides. The exact number of deaths is hard to establish. It is estimated by many sources <b>that</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a million and a half Armenians perished in camps, which excludes Armenians who may have died in other ways. Most estimates place the total number of deaths between 600,000 (by Turkish authorities) and 1,500,000 (by Western academics). These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the Armenian Christian martyr day.|$|E
25|$|Another {{historically}} significant immigrant {{group is}} Croatian. The {{number of their}} descendants today {{is estimated to be}} 380,000 persons, the equivalent of 2.4% of the population.

Over 700,000 Chileans may have British (English, Scottish or Welsh) origin, 4.5% of Chile's population. Chileans of Greek descent are estimated 90,000 to 120,000. Most of them live either in the Santiago area or in the Antofagasta area, and Chile is one of the 5 countries with the most descendants of Greeks in the world. The descendants of the Swiss reach 90,000 and it is estimated that about 5% of the Chilean population has some French ancestry. 184,000 are descendants of Italians. Other groups of European descendants are found in smaller numbers.|$|E

25|$|On 12 November 2013, the anti-government protesters on the 152nd day of anti-government protests {{attempted}} to siege Parliament {{for a second}} time (the first time being 23–24 July). Pro-protest sources alleged <b>that</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 7000 police employees had been deployed in order to stifle the protests that were joined by the occupying students. On that date, the police received signals of provocateur infiltrations and possible arson threats against the Parliament. Tension also developed between protesters and police officers after a demonstrator jumped on a deputy's car close to National Assembly Square. In the assessment of student protest leader Ivaylo Dinev, a much higher citizen turnout as well as better coordination and unity between protester groups (some were entirely committed to peaceful demonstrations, while others were more radically-minded) could have brought down the government on that date.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 1944, Oldendorf {{commanded}} {{from the}} bridge of his flagship, , the Fire Support Group tasked with the bombardment of Peleliu in the Palaus island group. This Fire Support Group consisted of five battleships, the , , , , and , eight cruisers, twelve destroyers, seven minesweepers, fifteen landing craft converted to rocket launchers, and a half-dozen submarines. At this point in his career, Oldendorf was an experienced battle commander who had handled similar assignments in three previous Marine landings. The bombardment was scheduled to last 3 days. By {{the end of the first}} day, aerial reconnaissance photos indicated <b>that</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 300 of the assigned targets had been destroyed or seriously damaged by the all-day bombardment and that virtually every aboveground structure and fortification had been wiped out.

25|$|Doctors, too, {{have changed}} professions {{and joined the}} {{international}} mobility trend. Filipino doctors have begun leaving their professions to train as nurses under the title MD-RN {{with the hope of}} immigrating to the U.S. or other developed nations more easily. Since 2000, 3,500 Filipino doctors have migrated abroad as nurses. The U.S. incentives for nurse migration encourage doctors to train as nurses in the hopes of increasing their economic prospects. As a result, the Philippines have a lower average of doctors and nurses with 0.58 and 1.69 respectively for a population of 1,000. The average statistics globally in contrast are 1.23 and 2.56. Between 2002 and 2007, 1,000 Filipino hospitals closed due to a shortage of health workers. A study conducted by the former Philippine Secretary of Health, Jaime Galvez-Tan, concluded <b>that</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 80% of government doctors have become nurses or are studying nursing. Of the 9,000 doctors-turned-nurses, 5,000 are working overseas. The extraordinary influence of this international migration has had devastating effects on the health of Filipinos. The number of deaths that were not prevented with medical attention have increased as hospitals are shut down and rural areas are deprived of any medical treatment.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was <b>that</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E

Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club issued [...] "TS-19" [...] a B– grade: despite proclaiming that [...] "there was some good stuff" [...] in the episode, Pierce opined that it fell below his expectations. He denounced many scenes in the episode—notably the explosion sequence—as he felt it was a waste of cinematography. [...] "The fact that almost all the scenes played out in dark, closed quarters wasted The Walking Dead gorgeous cinematography; the pacing was again off beat, with far too much padded scenes of people looking at one another in shock; and, though I'm usually not bothered by plot contrivances, there's no way anyone in a vehicle <b>that</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> such a huge explosion would have lived through it."
