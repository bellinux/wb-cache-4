It reported to the Security Council in August 1948 that [...] "the presence of troops of Pakistan" [...] inside Kashmir represented a [...] "material change" [...] in the situation. A two-part process was proposed for the withdrawal of forces. In the first part, Pakistan was to withdraw its forces as well as other Pakistani nationals from the state. In the second part, [...] "when <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>shall</b> have notified the Government of India" [...] that Pakistani withdrawal has been completed, India was to withdraw the bulk of its forces.

"In {{periodically}} estimating Germany's {{capacity to}} pay, <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>shall</b> examine the German system of taxation, first, {{to the end}} that the sums for reparation which Germany is required to pay shall become a charge upon all her revenues prior to that for the service or discharge of any domestic loan, and secondly, so as to satisfy itself that, in general, the German scheme of taxation is fully as heavy proportionately as that {{of any of the}} Powers represented on the Commission." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 5. But {{even this}} is not all. There is a further {{provision}} of devastating significance. Bonds representing payments in excess of $15,000,000,000 {{are not to be}} issued until the Commission is satisfied that Germany can meet the interest on them. But {{this does not mean that}} interest is remitted in the meantime. As from May 1, 1921, interest is to be debited to Germany on such part of her outstanding debt as has not been covered by payment in cash or kind or by the issue of bonds as above,[114] and [...] "the rate of interest shall be 5 per cent unless <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>shall</b> determine at some future time that circumstances justify a variation of this rate." [...] That is to say, the capital sum of indebtedness is rolling up all the time at compound interest. The effect of this provision towards increasing the burden is, on the assumption that Germany cannot pay very large sums at first, enormous. At 5 per cent compound interest a capital sum doubles itself in fifteen years. On the assumption that Germany cannot pay more than $750,000,000 annually until 1936 (i.e. 5 per cent interest on $15,000,000,000) the $25,000,000,000 on which interest is deferred will have risen to $50,000,000,000, carrying an annual interest charge of $2,500,000,000. That is to say, even if Germany pays $750,000,000 annually up to 1936, she will nevertheless owe us at that date more than half as much again as she does now ($65,000,000,000 as compared with $40,000,000,000). From 1936 onwards she will have to pay to us $3,250,000,000 annually in order to keep pace with the interest alone. At the end of any year in which she pays less than this sum she will owe more than she did at the beginning of it. And if she is to discharge the capital sum in thirty years from 1930, i.e. in forty-eight years from the Armistice, she must pay an additional $650,000,000 annually, making $3,900,000,000 in all.[115] ...|$|E
