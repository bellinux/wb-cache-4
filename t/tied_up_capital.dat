Logistics plays a key role in this process. The underlying philosophy behind the logistics concept is planning and co-ordinating the material flows from source to user as an integrated system rather than managing the goods flow as a series of independent activities. The cost of purchased materials and supplies is a significant part of a total costs in most organisations, but there is also a major opportunity for leveraging the capabilities and competencies of suppliers through closer integration of the buyers’ and suppliers’ logistics processes. The purpose of this study is to investigate for Flextronics Network Services the current situation regarding <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> in the inventory and to formulate proposals that will reduce the <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital.</b> Flextronics Network Services requested also a proposal of how the company could gain a {{competitive advantage}} with their project logistics in the future. In order to solve the problem, a case study was conducted with one business process in focus. To investigate the <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> in inventory, a mapping of material and information flows of one of Flextronics’ business processes was carried out. To identify where in process information is generated and how the information could be used. The mapping was the tool for finding where information was occurred. When information flow was identified the articles were traced and by this mapping the <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> in inventory was calculated. A proposal for how reduce the <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> in inventory has been given. It consists of reducing or, if possible, eliminating demand and suppliers’ uncertainties. For a company to gain a competitive advantage with its supply chain, it has to be co-ordinated together with other members of supply chain. This implies that there is a need for companies to integrate business processes across the supply chain, both internally and externally. Since the future competition will be between supply chains, the main pathway for FNS should be the integration of its supply chain by optimising it, first internally and then externally...|$|E
40|$|In process {{industries}} {{a break in}} one of the processes in the chain of production can lead to severe consequences as the entire production flow will be stopped and thus the entire output. Therefore, maintenance of the machinery and availability of spare parts are two pertinent issues. In order to secure the latter, process-based companies purchase and build up a stock of spare parts that subsequently leads to high capital being tied up. At the company Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner in Piteå no consistent system has been worked out to handle the issue of storing spare parts. Today, the company stores spare parts together with other type of material and products. This leads to problems connected to the possibility of overlooking and maintaining the high level of service needed to keep spare parts available at all times for the manufacturing department {{and at the same time}} keep the value of the <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> as low as possible. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to study how spare parts in the paper industry should be systemized and structured to enable an effective management of spare parts, which would lead to a decrease regarding <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital?</b> In order to achieve the purpose, the study started with an analysis of the current situation at the company. A theoretical framework was developed with a focus on logistics management, spare part management, standardization and cooperation. A benchmarking was also carried out by studying two other paper mills and their management of spare parts. The result of the study is concluded in five main recommendations aiming at reducing <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> regarding spare parts and their storage. The headlines of these recommendations are:- Standardized work and Knowledge transfer - ABC-Classification - An action plan to reduce <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> - Extended use of computer systems - To divide the storage in the computer system This thesis has partly been carried out at Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner Piteå so personnel at the company have continuously been involved in the study to help securing the applicability of the results.

40|$|The {{project was}} {{conducted}} {{during a period}} from November 2014 to January 2015 at the company Westermo Teleindustri AB (WTE). The subject {{of the project was}} to make an inventory more efficient. The inventory was located at WTE, but was owned by the subsidiary Westermo Sverige (WSE). The inventory had a high amount of <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital.</b> This was due to products that hadn’t been sold. After a while, some of these products became obsolete and defected and had to be scrapped. WSE wanted to increase the size of the inventory while WTE wanted to decrease both the size of the inventory and the amount of <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> by half. The purpose of the project was to investigate the possibility of reducing the amount of <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital,</b> the size of the inventory, sustain the service level to the customers and improving the forecasts of the demand. The tools that have been applied are: Ishikawa diagram, 5 S and 7 + 1 wastes (muda). These tools have contributed to information that was used in further work such as calculations and suggestions for improvements. Calculations and studies have been applied to the forecasts, the processes and to the layout. Studies have been made on the ABC-classes and the safety stock as well. By implementing forecasts, the group thinks that the size of the inventory could be smaller. If the products that haven’t been sold were to be removed from the inventory, the <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> could be reduced. The size of the inventory could also be smaller if these products would to be removed. The group was not able to tell if these reduces was by half or not. The group thinks that if WSE would update their ABC-classes, they could use the same system as WTE uses to calculate their forecasts. The service level will not be affected negatively by this system, since it takes consideration to the company’s desired service level. The inventory should be structured {{to make it easier to}} handle. The sorting should be made, based on how the employees think is the most logic way to handle the products. A proposition for how the inventory should be sorted have been suggested. The suggestion is that the products and product accessories are sorted separately. After that, all of these products should be sorted by part number, so that they will be easier to find. This will ease the process of placing a new product into the inventory. To sustain a solution that will last, the group thinks that the company should optimize the order handling, implement 5 S, calculate the ABC-classes for the products in the inventory, calculate which products that should have a safety stock, communicate and keep working with continuous improvements...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case study}} {{performed}} at Volvo Cars with the aim to improve decisions regarding production tooling in the sourcing process of car components within the progressively regionalized, global automotive manufacturer. As production tooling {{is one of the}} most costly element of a car project, decisions for instance, whether to own single, double or even triple sets of production tooling for a component are critical to handle properly. By analysing the sourcing of five different commodities, this thesis provides knowledge on how to create a revised decision model for production tooling decisions for when components are used for final assembly at more than one region. The analysis consist of the three following steps. Firstly an analysis of one historical sourcing case from each of the five commodities using with what the authors call the existing sourcing model to understand the decision on production tooling setup. The current model when taking single versus multiple production tooling decision is based on a TARR analysis where the investment in new production tooling and potential design and development lump sum at new location(s) are weighted and compared with the savings in landed cost over the car project’s life cycle. Since the current landed cost calculation at Volvo Cars does not take in parameters such as <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> from lead time and flexibility into consideration, the second step of the analysis is to analyse the same historical sourcing case from each of the five commodities with a revised sourcing model where the authors include the additional parameters into the landed cost. The additional parameter of <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> from lead time is quantified by the work in process multiplied by the weighted average cost of capital, which is 13 % at Volvo Cars. The work in process comes from the famous little’s law where work in process equals the lead time multiplied with the average consumption rate in units per time period. The additional parameter of <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> from flexibility is taking an materials planning and logistics perspective where flexibility is seen as Volvo Cars ability to consistently fulfilling a fixed service level towards the production flow, in this thesis case a service level of 98, 8 %. The service level can be translated to a service factor, which is used to statistically determine and generate the appropriate safety stock based on normal distribution to cover for disruptions and variance in demand using gathered data from Volvo Cars in terms of average demands, lead times and its standard deviations for the sourcing cases the authors analyse. The third and last step of the analysis consist of a meta-analysis of the first and second step to indicate the delta in landed costs and hence TARR analysis between the current and revised model to see if this delta will cause changes in the decision on production tooling setup in any of five sourcing cases and present the results. This study concludes that adding the parameters of <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> from lead time and flexibility has a substantial financial effect on the TARR analysis, thus can have an impact on the decisions on number of sets of production tooling even though only one of the five cases in this study showed any difference in production tooling decision when taking the added parameters into consideration...|$|E

Companies have also started to realize the economic aspects of an effective internal reverse logistics. In the past the value of an effective internal reverse logistic was something that companies tend to underestimate and there are few academic studies done in this area.   The purpose of this essay has been to identify key factors to create an effective in plant storage, transport, sorting and handling of returned steel. From these factors a generalized model for creating an effective return steel flow will be developed. The model will then be adjusted to fit a case company, which in this case is Sandvik Materials Technology (SMT) on Sandvik.   The purpose is answered by detailed studies of the literature in the subject combined with interviews and observations on SMT.

But, as Marx would presumably argue, what makes a profit is not necessarily what people really need, and therefore the possibility exists that profit making may undermine the most basic conditions for economic reproduction, including the supply of food and clean water, sanitation, adequate shelter, schooling, health care, and the like. These conditions are undermined not because capitalists dislike investing in these things—they might love to invest in them, if they could—but rather because {{it is difficult to}} make a secure profit from doing so. The required investments may be very large and long term, <b>tying</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> for many years, but either there is no possibility for profit or it is uncertain whether a sufficient profit can and will be made. If, for example, foreign investors invested in a country's essential infrastructure, a falling currency exchange rate some years later might wipe out the profits they could get. Therefore, such investments could occur only if foreign or local government authorities (and ultimately taxpayers) subsidized them (or at any rate, if they acted as a guarantor for the investments), or if financial institutions could find sufficient financial insurance to protect the value of investment capital through terms that reduce financial risk to investors.|$|R

When investors and managers perform DCF analysis, {{the important thing is that}} the net present value of the decision after discounting all future cash flows at least be positive (more than zero). If it is negative, that means that the investment decision would actually lose money even if it appears to generate a nominal profit. For instance, if the expected sale price of John Doe's house in the example above was not $150,000 in three years, but $130,000 in three years or $150,000 in five years, then on the above assumptions buying the house would actually cause John to lose money in present-value terms (about $3,000 in the first case, and about $8,000 in the second). Similarly, if the house was located in an undesirable neighborhood and the Federal Reserve Bank was about to raise interest rates by five percentage points, then the risk factor would be a lot higher than 5%: it might not be possible for him to predict a profit in discounted terms even if he thinks he could sell the house for $200,000 in three years.|$|R

Logging and transportation costs, stumpage prices, <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital,</b> dry matter losses and moisture content of harvested timber were considered in the study. Moisture content of artificially dried fuel chips made of fresh timber (55 %) was set to 20 %, 30 % and 40 % in the comparisons.

The procurement cost calculations indicated that with artificial drying and by avoiding dry material losses of timber, it could be possible to reduce current costs of the prevailing procurement system based on natural drying of timber at roadside landings. The maximum cost level of artificial drying ranged between 1. 2 – 3. 2 € MWh– 1 depending on the supply chain, moisture content and procurement volume of fuel chips.

A regression analysis shows increasing price effects on prices for agricultural land and on rental prices due to the ha-premiums, which were introduced by the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP) -Reforms in 1992. In "Part II - Farm Level Strategies for Land Purchase" the economic effects of changing land ownership are analysed using the data base of Part I. Recommendations for farmers are to find out if long term rental contracts are available to avoid <b>tying</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital.</b> If land market prices are lower than a certain threshold, land can be bought considering the financial liquidity of the enterprise. Selling land could be appropriate to avoid financial liquidity stress, but this should be only temporary and restricted to a marginal amount of land stocks. If profitability of crop production is relatively low or land prices are relative high and rental contracts terminated, an entrepreneur should seek to rent new land, if possible, or find alternative investments which yield higher profits than crop production.

40|$|Increased {{competition}} and extended complexity of supply chains {{due to a}} more globalized trade have result in situations where efficiency and effectiveness of supply chains have been given more attention. It {{is no longer just}} about having the right products, it is about finding new ways of increasing supply chain effectiveness to improve customer satisfaction. Companies have nowadays started to realise that supply chains often account for a large part of a their costs, and more focus should thus be dedicated to find ways of how to decrease the costs related to supply chain activities. Information is continuously streaming between different actors in a supply chain and it can be difficult for companies to utilize and collect all information efficiently. The visibility of information can sometimes be limited, while in other cases all the information needed is available, but there are no methods used to obtain the information. Finding methods for handling information can improve the overall supply chain performance, and improve the results for companies. The study towards the case company was two folded. The first phase aimed to identify problems that caused unnecessary high costs where the case company had potentials for improvements within their sales, purchasing and logistics departments. The second phase was to analyse solutions and suggestions that possibly could improve the performance of the case company and reduce unnecessary high costs, and prove that new strategies could be used to reduce the identified problems. To fulfil the aim and answer the research questions, a case study was conducted. Different data sources were used to get a deeper and broader understanding of the company’s situation. Data was mainly obtained through semi-structured interviews with employees and through internal documents. The findings of the thesis showed that the company had potentials of reducing their high <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> and increase their turnover rate. The aim was therefore to find areas in their operations that could be improved to help increase the turnover rate and find ways of decreasing the number of products in their inventory. Empirical findings was analysed and compared with a comprehensive literature review {{to be able to find}} possible solutions to their main problems. The identified solutions highlighted in this thesis is deeper collaboration with carefully selected customers, improvements on their ABC-categorization method and implementation of an inventory management method which takes costs into consideration to improve the amount of goods purchased at each occasion. The common denominator for all the different areas of improvement is to use the information they have in a better way and find new ways to obtain more information. This creates the opportunity for the case company to increase the turnover rate and decrease <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> and reduces number of products in inventory. The analysis showed that there are room for improvements. When introducing more relevant input to the ABC-categorization, it showed that there are many products with low margin stored in inventory. An implementation of an inventory management method showed that they will better understand and get indications of what quantities that is beneficial to purchase and thus can reduce costs. A deeper relationship with selected customers can increase possibility to obtain important information and ensure key supplier status among these customers. The study shows that using methods for utilizing the information in an efficient manner can increase efficiency and improve the performance...|$|E
40|$|Supply chain risk {{management}} (SCRM) {{is a topic}} that gains more and more interest from both the academic and practitioner’s perspective. The {{reason for this is}} the increased complexity in the global supply chain (SC) networks and many managers do not realize the risks they build in their SC by the continuous search to cut cost and decrease <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital.</b> One problem with SCRM is {{that it is hard to}} measure the performance of it and if it is really beneficial to work with it. The objective for this master thesis is to investigate how companies can evaluate and thereby improve their SCRM efforts by connecting the field of SCRM to the field of performance measurement systems (PMS). First, a thorough literature search was conducted where the current literature about SCRM and PMS was examined to understand what the literature recommends. This was followed by a multiple case study including semi-structured interviews with SC managers at eight companies to get the practical aspect of the problem. The results of the research show that companies work with SCRM in many different ways. The companies that have advanced furthest are the ones that have connected their SCRM to existing key performance indicators (KPIs) and because of that they have been able to measure the results of their SCRM efforts. The top-performers had a comprehensive understanding of their risk drivers and risks that affected their SC, which was consistent with the literature. Connecting the SCRM to the PMS, the companies can better monitor how the SCRM affect the performance goals for the SC performance. Then the next step is then to connect key risk indicators (KRIs) to the key KPIs that will give managers longer time to react to potential risks. Only one company in the study had accomplished this, hence, there is a great space for improvements for many companies...|$|E
40|$|This is a Master’s Thesis {{that has}} been carried out at the Global Outbound Logistics {{department}} at Scania. Scania manufactures trucks, buses and engines. Some trucks and buses are delivered to markets where it, due to reduced customs duties and cheaper manpower, is more profitable to do the assembly locally at so called Regional Product Centres (RPCs). Since the components are produced far away from the RPC markets the lead times become long. In addition, the customers’ buying behaviour at the RPC markets is often not comparable to the European culture were a customer can accept to wait for weeks for a unit to be delivered. The long lead time in combination with the customer behaviour implies that the RPCs need to keep a certain selection of standard models of buses and trucks in stock. It {{has turned out to be}} difficult for the pipeline managers at the RPCs to place order volumes that correspond well to what will be delivered to the business units or distributors later on. The result of this is high stock levels at the RPCs, which leads to an important amount of <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital.</b> Due to what is explained above, the purpose of this study is “to create a simulation model, based upon a process mapping, that visualises future volume levels in the pipeline due to different demand and ordering scenarios”. The short term target, which is also the target of this study, is to increase the RPCs understanding for how different demand and ordering scenarios influence the future volume levels in the pipeline. The long term target is to reduce <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> by adjusting buffer levels and lead times, while still ensuring a certain service level. The model should contribute to more accurate decision making with respect to the previous mentioned aspects. First, a high level process mapping was made in order to select which flows that were suitable for being subject for a detailed mapping. Second, a detailed mapping was made during which several RPC-, process- and function responsible were interviewed. After the detailed mapping, common denominators between the flows were identified and all activities were clustered into a solution that could be generalised and suitable for all flows. Factors such as lead times, deviation risks and capacity limitations were taken into account during the aggregation of activities. When a common view of the different RPC flows had been created, the mathematical relationships for how the goods can move throughout the process could be established. Then, the development and validation of the simulation model, which was an iterative process, could start. A directive was to build the simulation model in Microsoft Excel. Interviews were made with experienced model creators in order to find out how to create a user-friendly and robust model. The creation of the simulation model started with the development of a structure and then the content of each part was defined. A final validation, which consisted of sensitivity analysis and user trials, was finally done in order to ensure the simulation models functioning and accuracy. To conclude, a simulation model that will serve as a helpful tool for the RPCs when they are to decide which order volumes to place has been created. By clearly visualising the simulation results, the simulation model will hopefully increase the RPCs’ comprehension for how the pipeline works with respect to different ordering and demand scenarios. On top of this, the method used, the process mapping and the mathematical relationships that have been defined are important input for a possible future development of a more permanent and robust non-Microsoft Excel solution. This solution could probably be even more precise, automatically updated and have an even higher granularity...|$|E
40|$|Businesses are {{increasingly}} interested in improving their operations {{with the purpose}} of boosting company performance, which can be impacted through enhanced working capital management. Inventory management is one area that can help release working capital to other investments. In particular, the inventories in the end of supply chain are a potential phase for improvements, because these mostly <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital.</b> In international trade, the commonly accepted trade terms, Incoterms, determine where the main risks and responsibilities are exchanged between the trade parties, and the companies can recognize their sales as revenue at this point. Therefore, one opportunity for decreasing the tied-up capital is to select the delivery terms, Incoterms, differently in the supply chain. The Incoterms are defectively studied in the academic literature, and there are {{only a small number of}} papers deepening the knowledge surrounding the topic. The relationship between the delivery terms and working capital management seems to be unobserved in these previous studies and hence this thesis examines if the amount of the goods-in-transit inventories is dependent on the delivery terms used in inter- and intra-organizational contracts. This thesis is conducted as a single case study and a mixed methods approach was selected as the applied research strategy as it enables reaching a wider perspective in the topic. The quantitative data describes the potential correlation between the choices of the delivery terms and the inventories, while the qualitative data from the interviews brings a practical approach to this research. The study found that the relation between the goods-in-transit inventories and the delivery terms was not significant, but rather the flow of information and the internal process reasons seemed to determine the inventory time in the case company...|$|R
5000|$|Super Jumbo Mortgages {{present an}} {{increased}} risk to the lender in direct correlation {{with the size of}} the loan, substantially more than conforming mortgages. The increased risk of Super Jumbo mortgages is firstly {{due to the lack of}} [...] "agency" [...] support for these loans, effectively reducing the available pool of investors and insurers for all jumbo mortgages by an order of magnitude. Mortgages in excess of 1 million dollars have an even smaller secondary market of investors, and super jumbo mortgages in excess of 2 million dollars frequently require extensive [...] "sourcing" [...] of private investors prior to funding due to minimal institutional investor coverage. The complex nature of funding these loans requires the use of Super Jumbo mortgage specialists, whose compensation requirements are generally too prohibitive for retail banks and mass market lenders to accommodate outside of niche geographic areas, leaving much of the business to private concerns. Private Mortgage Bankers generally focus primarily on doing fewer, but larger deals, and thus have a familiarity with how and where to get these larger loans done. Securitization of Super Jumbo mortgages has not met with the same success as conventional jumbo mortgages, although work in this area is ongoing throughout the financial community. The underlying lack of liquidity for Super Jumbo Mortgage securities is compounded by a reduction in lending capacity for the institutions which must service these larger loans; as they lack a ready market for secondary sale the loans remain [...] "on the books" [...] of the lender, <b>tying</b> <b>up</b> <b>capital</b> in servicing that would otherwise be invested again. The assets against which super jumbo mortgages are secured are primarily classified as [...] "luxury" [...] residential real estate, a segment which is highly prone to market volatility in gross dollar terms. Luxury homes also require substantially more time to market in the event of foreclosure.|$|R
