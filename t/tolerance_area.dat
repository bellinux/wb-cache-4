Using defect <b>tolerance,</b> <b>area</b> and timing metrics, two previous hardware redundancy strategies are evaluated on the Mesh of Clusters architecture : Fine Grain Redundancy (FGR) and Improved Fine Grain Redundancy (IFGR). We show that using these techniques on a cluster of a Mesh of Clusters architecture permits to tolerate 8 times more defects than on an industrial Mesh FPGA with a low area overhead (- 6 % for FGR and 22 % for IFGR) and a low increase of Critical Path Delay (CPD) (6 % for FGR and 2 % for IFGR).

Compared to the Mesh of Clusters architecture without defect tolerance techniques, the best trade off between defect tolerance (36. 4 %), area overhead (11. 56 %) and CPD (+ 7. 46 %) is obtained using AFGR.

40|$|Quantitative {{assessment}} tools are urgently {{needed in the}} areas of fault tolerance, software assurance, and computer security. Assessment methods typically employed in various combinations are fault injection, formal verification, and testing. However, these methods are expensive because they are labor-intensive, with costs scaling at least linearly with the number of software modules tested. Additionally, they are subject to human lapses and oversights because they require two different representations for each system, and then base results on a direct or an indirect representation comparison. The Ballista project has found that robustness testing forms a niche in which scalable quantitative assessment can be achieved at low cost. This scalability stems from two techniques: associating state-setting information with test cases based on data types, and using one generic, but narrow, behavioral specification for all modules. Given that this approach has succeeded in comparing the robustness of various operating systems, it is natural to ask if it can be made more generally applicable. It appears the Ballista-like testing can be used in the fault <b>tolerance</b> <b>area</b> to measure the generic robustness of a variety of API implementations, and in particular to identify reproducible ways to crash and hang software.

Tegaserod, a 5 HT 4 receptor agonist, enhances gastric emptying and gastric accommodation in man. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of tegaserod on the maximum tolerated volume of nutrient ingested and postprandial symptoms in man. Methods: Seventeen healthy volunteers (7 m, mean age 27  1) were studied on two separate occasions, after 3 days pretreatment with placebo or tegaserod 6 mg b. i. d. They underwent a slow satiety drinking test (1. 5 kcal/ml; 13 % proteins, 48 % carbohydrates, 39 % lipids) until maximum satiety. At 5 -minute intervals, the intensity of 9 symptoms (satiety, fullness, bloating, nausea, belching, pain, epigastric burning, heartburn, discomfort) was assessed on 10 cm visual analog (VAS) scales. Nutrient <b>tolerance,</b> <b>area</b> under the curve (AUC) for symptom intensities and symptom satiety scores were recorded and compared by paired t-test and ANOVA. Results: Pretreatment with tegaserod had no influence on nutrient tolerance (maximum intake 670  57 vs. 671  65 ml, NS). After tegaserod, symptom intensity scores for fullness (AUC 1147  141 vs. 1568  141 mm*min, p< 0. 05), bloating (AUC 825  165 vs. 1352  227 mm*min, p< 0. 05), epigastric pain (AUC 66  42 vs. 133  67 mm*min, p= 0. 05), and epigastric discomfort (AUC 701  50 vs. 1158  203 mm*min, p= 0. 05), were decreased (all ANOVA significant, p< 0. 05), while scores for satiety, belching, heartburn, epigastric burning and nausea were not altered. Conclusion: The 5 -HT 4 receptor agonist tegaserod does not affect meal-induced satiety and nutrient volume tolerance, but tegaserod decreases the intensity of several meal-induced symptoms.

Moreover, the magnitude of the baseline impairments of glucose tolerance was significantly related to the extent of change in both groups. Depending on the fitness level and individual preferences both types of exercise may be useful for the {{prevention of}} type 2 diabetes and disorders in lipid metabolism...|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, {{occurrence}} {{in a number of}} protected <b>areas,</b> <b>tolerance</b> to some degree of habitat modification, and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{and future}} ultra-deep-submicron (UDSM) {{technologies}} introduce several new problems in analog design. Nonlinear output conductance {{in combination with}} reduced voltage gain pose limits in linearity of (feedback) circuits. Gate-leakage mismatch exceeds conventional matching <b>tolerances.</b> Increasing <b>area</b> does not improve matching any more, except if higher power consumption is accepted or if active cancellation techniques are used. Another issue is the drop in supply voltages. Operating critical parts at higher supply voltages by exploiting combinations of thin- and thick-oxide transistors can solve this problem. Composite transistors are presented {{to solve this problem}} in a practical way. Practical rules of thumb based on measurements are derived for the above phenomena...|$|R
5000|$|The JIS defines {{two main}} series of paper sizes. The JIS A-series is {{identical}} to the ISO A-series, but with slightly different <b>tolerances.</b> The <b>area</b> of B-series paper is 1.5 times that of the corresponding A-paper (instead of the factor [...] = 1.414... for the ISO B-series), so the length ratio is approximately 1.22 times the length of the corresponding A-series paper. The aspect ratio of the paper is the same as for A-series paper. Both A- and B-series paper is widely available in Japan, Taiwan and China, and most photocopiers are loaded with at least A4 and either one of A3, B4 and B5 paper.|$|R
