Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame."

60|$|I put {{his answer}} as pleasantly as I could. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> ungracious to decline an {{invitation}} of that sort, and I ascribed {{his refusal to}} lack of money.|$|E

6000|$|... "You boasted <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while ago," [...] said I, smiling grimly, [...] "that {{the man did}} {{not live}} who had thrice fooled you. That man does live, for that man am I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} give up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> Romola, about their eating, and those things. For {{you have never}} had a baby, and I had twins, only they died {{as soon as they were}} born." ...|$|E
60|$|Madame Richard {{touched the}} cross which hung upon her bosom. Her eyes, it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> narrowed <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R

60|$|I {{have not}} seen the Spectator article; nobody sent it to me. If you had an old copy lying by you, you would be very good to {{despatch}} it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> abuse from my grandmamma would do me good in health, if not in morals.|$|E
6000|$|The Minister signed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> move <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{nearer to}} him. [...] "I must say it," [...] he whispered, [...] "and I am {{afraid of her}} hearing me. Is there {{anything}} in her face that reminds you of her miserable mother?" ...|$|R
