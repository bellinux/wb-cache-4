He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E

500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E

[...] " [...] I said: [...] "A hadeeth I heard that I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> heard the Messenger of Allah saying: 'Whoever Allah entrusts with {{authority}} over {{the affairs of the}} Muslims and he neglects the needs and wants of the poor amongst them, Allah will neglect him and his needs and wants." [...] He added that Muawiyah appointed a man in charge of addressing the people's needs upon hearing the Hadith.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to [...] "Facing Facts About Race", the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates accused Hanson {{of racism and}} stupidity. Referring to Hanson's [...] "Talk", Coates wrote: [...] "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this [...] "talk" [...] as stupid advice. If I were {{to tell you that}} I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because [...] "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," [...] you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because [...] "Jews are really successful," [...] you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is...There is no difference between my argument above and the notion that black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats. But one of the effects of racism is its tendency to justify stupidity." ...|$|E
