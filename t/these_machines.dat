5|$|The two {{missions}} of 26 September 1942 had been flown in Bf 109G-2/trop, {{in one of}} which Marseille had shot down seven Allied aircraft. The first six of <b>these</b> <b>machines</b> were to replace the Gruppes Bf 109Fs. All had been allocated to Marseille's 3 Staffel. Marseille had previously ignored orders to use these new aircraft because of its high engine failure rate, but on the orders of Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Marseille reluctantly obeyed. One of <b>these</b> <b>machines,</b> WK-Nr. 14256 (Engine: Daimler-Benz DB 605 A-1, W.Nr. 77 411), {{was to be the}} final aircraft Marseille flew.|$|E
5|$|Antony was {{not able}} to take Phraaspa and besieged the city, but Artavasdes I and the Parthian {{commander}} Monaeses destroyed two legions of Antony's general, Oppius Statianus, who had slowly followed with the siege machines of the Antony's troops. Antony could not capture Phraaspa without <b>these</b> <b>machines.</b> Therefore, he had to withdraw to Armenia and Parthia was not invaded.|$|E

5|$|Machines that {{generated}} static electricity {{with a glass}} disc were popular and widespread in Europe by 1740. In 1745, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek discovered independently that the electric charge from <b>these</b> <b>machines</b> could be stored in a Leyden jar, named after the city of Leiden in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Coin-operated {{machines}} to vend food, for amusement, and for gambling became {{popular in the}} 1890s. Such machines could be placed on otherwise unused floor space in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners. Beginning about 1898, coin-operated mechanical pianos also became popular. The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing machines ranging from a mechanically played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some {{machines to}}ok cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin of choice for <b>these</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} army {{then proceeded}} to Amyclae, from whence they plundered the surrounding countryside. Lucius Quinctius, meanwhile, received the voluntary surrender of several coastal towns in Laconia. The allies then advanced on the largest city in the area, Sparta's port and naval arsenal at Gythium. As the land forces began to invest the city, the allied navy arrived. The sailors from the three fleets set to construct siege engines within a few days. Though <b>these</b> <b>machines</b> had a devastating effect on the city walls, the garrison successfully held out.|$|E
5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies. <b>These</b> <b>machines</b> allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.|$|E

5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for <b>these</b> <b>machines</b> start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due {{to the need to}} transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was more}} {{difficult}} in practice. The French were still a vacillating ally until the spring/summer, 1940, but the Command was still stretched by German naval forces operating from Germany, and then Norway. The Germans used surface vessels and U-boats to breakout into the Atlantic by using periods of dark, in winter, and weather conditions unfavourable to aircraft that were still without radar. Tiger Moth biplanes were used, as were civil pilots, {{to compensate for the}} lack of Hudsons. <b>These</b> <b>machines</b> were also without armament to defend from enemy fighters. It could carry 250lb DCs, but there was no sufficient stock. Only 100lb bombs could be used by the Anson, and they were ineffective. Crew were also insufficiently trained.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Galland pursued {{innovations}} {{with existing}} designs. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 aircraft was formed into several Geschwader with distinctly upgraded firepower. Called the Sturmbock (Battering ram), <b>these</b> <b>machines</b> could inflict heavy damage on unescorted bomber formations. Galland supported {{the conversion of}} units such as Jagdgeschwader 300 to the Sturmbock role. The Sturmbock were heavily armed and armoured, which meant they were un-manoeuvrable and vulnerable without protection from escorting Bf 109s. Still, the tactics quickly became widespread and {{were one of the}} few Luftwaffe success stories in 1944. Galland said after the war, that {{had it not been for}} the Allied landing in Normandy which increased the need for lighter fighter variants, each Geschwader in the Luftwaffe would have contained a Gruppe of Sturmbock aircraft by September 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. <b>These</b> <b>machines</b> contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of <b>these</b> <b>machines</b> in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, the French {{units were}} warned {{an hour before}} the German bombers took off, but owing to equally poor staff work, few French squadrons heard the {{scramble}} signal when it was radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were caught on the ground. In the end, only eighty took off to intercept the incoming German formations. German progress was monitored by shadowing Potez 631s, one of which was shot down. The Germans would copy this tactic when intercepting United States Army Air Force (USAAF) heavy bombers during the Defence of the Reich campaign. Along with French AAA defences, the fighters shot down ten German aircraft, including four bombers. One of <b>these</b> <b>machines</b> was piloted by Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51, Josef Kammhuber, who was wounded in action and taken as a prisoner of war. Kammhuber would be released after the French surrender. He was replaced as Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 by Fisser, commander of KG 77. Fisser was killed two months later leading KG 51 during the Battle of Britain.Jagdfliegerführer 3 (Fighter Flying Leader 3) Oberst Gerd von Massow was also shot down. He was replaced by Oberst Werner Junck, until the former's release by German forces on 12 June 1940. German formations attacked twenty-eight railways and marshalling yard centres. All damage inflicted was light. None were out of action for more than 24 hours.|$|E
