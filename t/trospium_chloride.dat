40|$|<b>Trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> is a {{quaternary}} ammonium compound, {{which is a}} competitive antagonist at muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Preclinical studies using porcine and human detrusor muscle strips demonstrated that <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> was many-fold more potent than oxybutynin and tolterodine in inhibiting contractile responses to carbachol and electrical stimulation. The drug is poorly bioavailable orally (< 10 %) and food reduces absorption by 70 %– 80 %.

In active-controlled trials, <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> was at least equivalent to immediate-release formulations of oxybutynin and tolterodine in efficacy and tolerability. The most problematic adverse effects of <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> are the anticholinergic effects of dry mouth and constipation.

Outcomes of interest were patient perceived cure or improvement in symptoms, differences in number of incontinent episodes and number of voids in 24 hours, urodynamic measures of bladder function (volume at first sensation, maximum cystometric capacity, and presence of detrusor contractions) and side effects. Results: At the end of the treatment no difference was noted in the aspects of symptomatic and urodynamic improvement but dryness of mouth (34 % vs. 11, 8 %, p= 0, 031) was statistically significant in propiverine group (p 0, 05), urgency (55 % vs. 63, 2 %, p> 0, 05), nocturia (73, 03 % vs. 77, 02 %, p> 0, 05), urge incontinence (81, 73 %, vs. 78 % p> 0, 05), episodes and number of ped usage per day (70, 97 % vs. 60, 83 %) decreased in group I and group II in a statistically significant manner (p 0, 05), maximum cystometric capacity (21, 10 % vs. 10, 5 %, p> 0, 05) and disapperance of detrusor contractions (48, 3 % vs. 58, 8 %, p> 0, 05) were noted in both groups in a statistically significant manner (p 0, 05).

40|$|A {{negative}} food effect, i. e. {{a decrease}} in bioavailability upon the co‐administration of compounds together with food, has been attributed particularly with high solubility/low permeability compounds (BCS class III). Different mechanisms have been proposed including intestinal dilution leading to a lower concentration gradient across the intestinal wall as well as binding of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to food components in the intestine and thereby decreasing the fraction of the dose available for absorption. These mechanisms refer primarily to the compound {{and not to the}} dosage form. An increase in viscosity of the dissolution fluid will in particular affect the absorption of BCS type III compounds with preferential absorption in the upper small intestine if the API release is delayed from the dosage form. The present study demonstrated that the increase in viscosity of the dissolution medium, following ingestion of a solid meal, may drastically reduce disintegration and dissolution. For that purpose the viscosity of the standard FDA meal was determined and simulated by solutions of HPMC in buffer. As model formulations, three commercially available tablets containing <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride,</b> a BCS class III m ‐cholinoreceptor antagonist was used. <b>Trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> drug products have been described to undergo a negative food effect of more than 80 % following ingestion with food. The tablets showed prolonged disintegration times and reduced dissolution rates in viscous media, which could be attributed to changes in the liquid penetration rates. The effect was particularly significant for film‐coated tablets relative to uncoated dosage forms. The results show the necessity of considering media viscosity when designing in vitro models of drug release for BCS type III drug formulations. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Flexible dosing of anticholinergics {{used for}} overactive bladder (OAB) {{treatment}} {{is a useful}} strategy in clinical practice for achieving a maximum effective and maximum tolerated level of therapeutic benefit. In this post hoc analysis we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> treatment for urinary urge incontinence (UUI) with focus on flexible dosing. Methods The data came from a 12 -week, randomised, double-blind, phase IIIb study in which 1658 patients with urinary frequency plus urge incontinence received <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> 15 mg TID (n = 828) or 2. 5 mg oxybutynin hydrochloride TID (n = 830). After four weeks, daily doses were doubled and not readjusted in 29. 2 % (242 / 828) of patients in the trospium group, and in 23. 3 % (193 / 830) in the oxybuytnin group, {{until the end of}} treatment. We assessed the absolute reduction in weekly UUI episodes and the change in intensity of dry mouth, recorded in patients' micturition diaries. Adverse events were also evaluated. Statistics were descriptive. Results Dose escalation of either trospium or oxybutynin increased reduction in UUI episodes in the population studied. At study end, there were no relevant differences between the "dose adjustment" subgroups and the respective "no dose adjustment" subgroups (trospium: P = 0. 249; oxybutynin: P = 0. 349).

40|$|International audienceAims To {{examine the}} {{relative}} efficacy {{and safety of}} trospium 20 mg bid and 60 mg extended release formulations and position this drug against other antimuscarinic agents Methods Data were identified on the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Key publications on trospium 20 mg and 60 mg clinical studies in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) were identified and efficacy and safety compared between these formulations {{as well as other}} antimuscarinic agents. Results Trospium offers the principal advantage over other antimuscarinic agents that, as it is a quaternary amine, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is therefore less likely to cause central nervous system effects observed with several other agents. Moreover, with its minimal liver metabolisation, independent of the main cytochrome pathways, trospium has a low risk of drug-drug interaction in patients taking multiple pharmacological agents. Trospium 60 mg ER is as effective as trospium 20 mg bid in improving the key outcome parameters associated with OAB, but with a lower rate of dry mouth, the most common side-effect of these agents. Trospium has comparable efficacy and safety to the other antimuscarinic agents currently marketed. Good patient persistence with treatment has been reported with trospium. Conclusion There are currently a large number of antimuscarinic drugs on the market without clear evidence to distinguish one agent from another in terms of efficacy provided an adequate dose is used in the clinical setting. The new formulation of trospium is certainly worth considering as a pharmacological treatment of patients with OAB, particularly the elderly where one wants to avoid the potential for cognitive dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) {{affects the}} lives of {{millions}} of people worldwide and antimuscarinics are the pharmacological treatment of choice. Meta-analyses of all currently used antimuscarinics for treating OAB found similar efficacy, making the choice dependent on their adverse event profiles. However, conventional meta-analyses often fail to quantify and compare adverse events across different drugs, dosages, formulations, and routes of administration. In addition, the assessment of the broad variety of adverse events is dissatisfying. Our aim was to compare adverse events of antimuscarinics using a network meta-analytic approach that overcomes shortcomings of conventional analyses. METHODS: Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialized Trials Register, previous systematic reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials comparing at least one antimuscarinic for treating OAB with placebo or with another antimuscarinic, and adverse events as outcome measures. Two authors independently extracted data. A network meta-analytic approach was applied allowing for joint assessment of all adverse events of all currently used antimuscarinics while fully maintaining randomization. RESULTS: 69 trials enrolling 26 ' 229 patients were included. Similar overall adverse event profiles were found for darifenacin, fesoterodine, transdermal oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine, and <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> but not for oxybutynin orally administered when currently used starting dosages were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed generally applicable transparent network meta-analytic approach summarizes adverse events in an easy to grasp way allowing straightforward benchmarking of antimuscarinics for treating OAB in clinical practice. Most currently used antimuscarinics seem to be equivalent first choice drugs to start the treatment of OAB except for oral oxybutynin dosages of ≥ 10 mg/d which may have more unfavorable adverse event profiles...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Typically in Korea, for a {{standard}} dose (0. 4 mg) of tamsulosin, two low doses (0. 2 mg) are administered. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate and compare the effi-cacy of tamsulosin (0. 2 mg and 0. 4 mg) and alfuzosin (10 mg) in the treatment of lower ureteral stones. Materials and Methods: A total of 141 patients presenting with a single 4 - to 10 -mm sized lower ureteral stone were randomly assigned to 4 groups. Patients in group 1 (n= 41) and group 2 (n= 30) received an oral dose of 0. 2 mg tamsulosin once and twice daily, respectively, and patients in group 3 (n= 36) received a daily oral dose of 10 mg alfuzosin.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron 50 mg compared with oral antimuscarinic agents in adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service perspective. MethodsA Markov model including health states for symptom severity, treatment status, and adverse events was developed. Cycle length was 1 month, and the time horizon was 5 years. Antimuscarinic comparators were tolterodine extended release, solifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin extended release and immediate release (IR), darifenacin, and <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride</b> modified release. Transition probabilities for symptom severity levels and adverse events were estimated from a mirabegron trial and a mixed treatment comparison. Estimates for other inputs were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total health care costs, including costs of drug acquisition, physician visits, incontinence pad use, and botox injections, were modeled. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. ResultsBase-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from £ 367 (vs. solifenacin 10 mg) to £ 15, 593 (vs. oxybutynin IR 10 mg) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 20, 000 /QALY gained, the probability of mirabegron 50 mg being cost-effective ranged from 70. 2 % versus oxybutynin IR 10 mg to 97. 8 % versus darifenacin 15 mg. A limitation of our analysis is the uncertainty {{due to the lack}} of direct comparisons of mirabegron with other agents; a mixed treatment comparison using rigorous methodology provided the data for the analysis, but the studies involved showed heterogeneity. ConclusionsMirabegron 50 mg appears to be cost-effective compared with standard oral antimuscarinic agents for the treatment of adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service perspective...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Millions {{of people}} {{worldwide}} experience overactive bladder (OAB), and antimuscarinics are the pharmacologic treatment of choice. Several conventional meta-analyses have been published, but {{they fail to}} quantify efficacy and adverse events across drugs, dosages, formulations, and pharmaceutical forms. OBJECTIVE: To perform two network meta-analyses summarizing the efficacy and adverse events of antimuscarinics {{in the treatment of}} OAB. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline and Scopus searches, previous systematic reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, and the reference lists of relevant articles were searched. Trialists were contacted. Eligible studies were randomized trials that compared at least one antimuscarinic for treating OAB with placebo or with another antimuscarinic, and that reported efficacy and/or adverse event outcomes. Efficacy was assessed for six outcomes (perception of cure or improvement, urgency episodes per 24 h, leakage episodes per 24 h, urgency incontinence episodes per 24 h, micturitions per 24 h, and nocturia episodes per 24 h). Adverse events were assessed in seven categories according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Across all outcomes, a summary efficacy and an adverse event score were computed. Two authors independently extracted data. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: For the comparison of the efficacy, 76 trials enrolling 38 662 patients were included; for adverse events, 90 trials enrolling 39 919 patients were included. In the subset of studies reporting on treatments and dosages as used in clinical practice, 40 mg/d <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride,</b> 100 mg/g per day oxybutynin topical gel, and 4 mg/d fesoterodine had the best efficacy, while higher dosages of orally administered oxybutynin and propiverine had the least favorable relationship of efficacy and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study allowing trade-offs between efficacy and adverse events of various drugs and dosages in the treatment of patients with OAB. Differences among the various antimuscarinics call for careful, patient-centered management in which regimen changes should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Background: Persistence with antimuscarinic {{therapy in}} overactive bladder (OAB) is poor, {{but may be}} {{different}} for mirabegron, a β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist with a different adverse event profile. Objective: To compare persistence and adherence with mirabegron versus tolterodine extended release (ER) and other antimuscarinics in routine clinical practice over a 12 -mo period. Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective, longitudinal, observational study of anonymised data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database. Eligibility: age ≥ 18 yr, ≥ 1 prescription for target OAB drug (between May 1, 2013 and June 29, 2014), and 12 -mo continuous enrolment {{before and after the}} index prescription date. Interventions: Mirabegron, darifenacin, fesoterodine, flavoxate, oxybutynin ER or immediate-release (IR), propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine ER or IR, and <b>trospium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint was persistence (time to discontinuation). Secondary endpoints included 12 -mo persistence rates and adherence (assessed using medication possession ratio, MPR). Cox proportional-hazards regression models and logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors were used to compare cohorts. Analyses were repeated after 1 : 1 matching. Results and limitations: The study population included 21. 996 eligible patients. In the unmatched analysis, the median time-to-discontinuation was significantly longer for mirabegron (169 d, interquartile range [IQR] 41 -not reached) compared to tolterodine ER (56 d, IQR 28 - 254; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval 1. 41 - 1. 71; p <. 0. 0001) and other antimuscarinics (range 30 - 78 d; adjusted HR range 1. 24 - 2. 26, p <. 0. 0001 for all comparisons). The 12 -mo persistence rates and MPR were also significantly greater with mirabegron than with all the antimuscarinics. Limitations include the retrospective design, use of prescription records to estimate outcomes, and inability to capture reasons for discontinuation. Conclusions: Persistence and adherence were statistically significantly greater with mirabegron than with tolterodine ER and other antimuscarinics prescribed for OAB in the UK. Patient summary: This study assessed persistence and adherence (or compliance) with medications prescribed for OAB in a large UK population. We found that patients prescribed mirabegron remained on treatment for longer and showed greater adherence than those prescribed traditional antimuscarinics. For chronic conditions such as overactive bladder, long-term adherence is important to maintain treatment benefit. Persistence with antimuscarinics is a recognised challenge. This analysis of a UK primary care database demonstrates that persistence and adherence are significantly greater with mirabegron versus antimuscarinics...|$|E
