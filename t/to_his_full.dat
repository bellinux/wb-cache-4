5|$|Dudley's {{youth was}} {{overshadowed by the}} {{downfall}} of his family in 1553 after his father, the Duke of Northumberland, had failed to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne. Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and {{took part in the}} Battle of St. Quentin under Philip II of Spain, which led <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> rehabilitation. On Elizabeth I's accession in November 1558, Dudley was appointed Master of the Horse. In October 1562, he became a Privy Councillor and, in 1587, was appointed Lord Steward of the Royal Household. In 1564, Dudley became Earl of Leicester and, from 1563, one of the greatest landowners in North Wales and the English West Midlands by royal grants.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus (Latin: Germanicus Julius Caesar; 24 May 15 BC – 10 October AD 19) was {{a member}} of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and a {{prominent}} general of the Roman Empire known for his campaigns in Germania. The son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, Germanicus was born into a prominent branch of the patrician gens Claudia. The agnomen Germanicus was added <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in Germania. In AD 4, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, Tiberius who succeeded Augustus as Roman emperor a decade later. As a result, Germanicus became an official member of the gens Julia, another prominent family which he was related to on his mother's side. His connection to the Julii was further consolidated through a marriage between himself and Agrippina the Elder, a granddaughter of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|From late 2008, the {{national}} team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled {{to qualify for the}} 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions as he played Messi out of position, positioned too deep for him to be able to contribute to the attack <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> ability. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela. During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme. Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process. Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.|$|E

25|$|In horse racing, castrating a {{stallion}} may {{be considered}} worthwhile if the animal is easily distracted by other horses, difficult to handle, or otherwise not running <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> potential due to behavioral issues.

25|$|His playing {{style is}} that of the {{creative}} playmaker - picking out passes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> forwards, as well as taking his own scores, usually at vital junctures of a game. The main key to his play that sets him apart from his contemporaries is his ability to control the pace, and direction of a match, through leading by example. Peter Canavan, whose influence since his retirement has been missed, has expressed he feels McGuigan's leadership is the key to any Tyrone success, and have struggled to take control of matches in his long absence.|$|E
25|$|Claudius (Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus), {{the younger}} brother of Germanicus, was a Claudian {{on the side of}} his father, Nero Claudius Drusus, younger brother of Tiberius. However, he was also related to the Julian branch of the Imperial family through his mother, Antonia Minor. As a son of Antonia, Claudius was a great-nephew of Augustus. Moreover, he was also Augustus' step-grandson due to the fact that his father was a stepson of Augustus. Unlike Tiberius and Germanicus, both of whom were born as Claudians and became adopted Julians, Claudius was not adopted into the Julian family. Upon {{becoming}} emperor, however, he added the Julian-affiliated cognomen Caesar <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> name.|$|E

25|$|Mark Ravin Ramprakash, MBE (born 5 September 1969) is {{a former}} English cricketer. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he initially made his name playing for Middlesex, and was selected for England aged 21. Despite being among the most gifted and heavily scoring English batsman of his generation at county level, he rarely performed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> potential during a long but intermittent international career. He became a particularly prolific run scorer {{when he moved to}} Surrey in 2001, averaging over 100 runs per innings in two successive seasons (2006 & 2007). He is one of only 25 players {{in the history of the}} sport to have scored 100 first-class centuries.|$|E
25|$|Duryodhana {{approached}} Bhishma {{one night}} and accused him of not fighting the battle <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> strength because of his affection for the Pandavas. The angry Bhishma took a vow that either he will kill Arjuna or will make Lord Krishna break his promise of not picking up any weapons during the war. On the next day there was an intense battle between Bhishma and Arjuna. Although Arjuna was very powerful, he {{was no match for}} Bhishma. Bhishma soon shot arrows which cut Arjuna's armour and then also his Gandiva bow's string. Arjuna was helpless before the wrath of his grand-uncle. As Bhishma was about to kill Arjuna with his arrows, Sri Krishna who took vow of not raising a weapon in the war, lifted a chariot wheel and threatened Bhishma. Arjuna stopped Lord Krishna. Arjuna convinced Krishna to return to the chariot and put down the wheel, promising to redouble his determination in the fight. Thus Bhishma fulfilled his vow.|$|E
25|$|The Reserve Bank of India was {{formally}} inaugurated on Monday, 1 April 1935 with its Central Office at Calcutta. Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934, empowered it to continue issuing Government of India notes until its own notes {{were ready for}} issue. The bank issued the first five rupee note bearing the portrait of George VI in 1938. This was followed by Rs. 10 in February, Rs 100 in March and Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 in June 1938. The first Reserve Bank issues were signed by the second Governor, Sir James Taylor. In August 1940, the one-rupee note was reintroduced as a wartime measure, as a Government note with {{the status of a}} rupee coin. During the war, the Japanese produced high-quality forgeries of the Indian currency. This necessitated a change in the watermark. The profile portrait of George VI was changed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> frontal portrait. The security thread was introduced {{for the first time in}} India. The George VI series continued till 1947 and thereafter as a frozen series till 1950 when post-independence notes were issued.|$|E

25|$|For much of {{its history}} Fittipaldi Automotive was entirely {{focussed}} around Emerson Fittipaldi. Emerson was a double world champion renowned for a smooth and quick style {{when he joined the}} family team. Although his older brother drove in the team's first season, the suggestion that Emerson might drive for the team was always in the air and only a year later he cancelled contract discussions with his then team McLaren at a very late stage and signed with Fittipaldi. Although he remained capable of front-running performances, during his time with Fittipaldi Automotive he became an inconsistent performer. On several occasions team manager Jo Ramírez berated his driver after a sudden burst of speed indicated that he had not been driving <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> potential. By 1980 Fittipaldi's team mate Keke Rosberg thought him long past his best, and found him demotivated. Emerson retired {{at the end of that}} year after five full seasons with the family team. Like fellow world champion Jacques Villeneuve’s five-year stint with the BAR team set up for him with BAT money in 1998, the partnership ended the front running Formula One career of a young and highly competitive driver, although he would later build a very successful career in top level American single seater racing in the CART series.|$|E
500|$|After {{being sentenced}} to life imprisonment, Lhermitte filed a lawsuit seeking €3m in damages against her {{psychiatrist}}, Diderik Veldekens. She said that had her psychiatrist rushed to see her {{while she was in}} her disturbed state, the crime would not have been committed. Lhermitte wanted to “secure recognition of the prejudice genuinely suffered” due to the psychiatrist’s alleged inaction. During the trial, Veldekens reported meeting with Lhermitte after a first alarming letter, but couldn't meet with her on February 13, 2007 due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> schedule. In December 2011, the case was dismissed against Veldekens. The court ruled that the criminal charges against the psychiatrist were [...] "irrelevant." ...|$|E

He was given the title of staff supervisor and his birthday was celebrated on November 18.|$|E

500|$|When Max Allan Collins {{wrote the}} graphic novel Road to Perdition, his book agent saw {{potential}} in the story as a film adaptation {{and showed it to}} a film agent. By 1999, the novel had reached Dean Zanuck, who was the vice president of development at the company owned [...] by his father, producer Richard D. Zanuck. The novel was sent to the elder Zanuck in Morocco, who was there producing Rules of Engagement (2000). The Zanucks agreed on the story's prospect and sent it to director-producer Steven Spielberg. Shortly afterward, Spielberg set up the project at his studio DreamWorks, though he did not pursue direction of the film due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> slate.|$|E

This physical contact between the Creator and Eve is repeated even more noticeably in the way Adam's toes touch the Lord's foot. Here is the stressing of a rapport: Adam seems indeed to be stretching <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> length {{in order to make}} contact with the Creator. And the billowing out of the cloak around the Creator's heart, from where the garment falls in marked folds and contours to Adam's feet, also seems to indicate that here a current of divine power flows down, so that this group of three actually forms a closed circuit, a complex of magical energy ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that}} {{although}} [...] "30 Rock gave us yet another riff on what a wild and crazy guy Tracy Jordan is", the series was really finding its footing. Mitovich enjoyed the appearances of Dratch and Parnell, labeling the latter as {{the highlight of the}} episode. Robert Canning of IGN said that the episode [...] "failed to deliver the comic gold we were hoping for." [...] Canning had hoped that Tracy's storyline would be a [...] "subtle, fairly straightforward plot", in contrast to the wackiness the series had a reputation for, but found it unfunny. The reviewer did not enjoy the appearances of Dratch and Winters, and felt Conan O'Brien was not used <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> potential. Canning rated the episode 5 out of 10.|$|E

500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break, although ultimately he still ended up having a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes with a tremendous price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the ground rules regarding where Skinner stood in regards to the X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be a bad guy, but because Mitch Pileggi was such a good actor the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E
500|$|His praenomen is unknown, {{but he was}} {{probably}} named Nero Claudius Drusus after his father (conventionally called [...] "Drusus"), or possibly Tiberius Claudius Nero after his uncle Tiberius. In 9 BC, the agnomen Germanicus was added <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> name when it was posthumously awarded to his father {{in honor of his}} victories in Germania. Though the name was inherited by his siblings too, the title seems at first to have been used exclusively by him. By AD 4 he was adopted as Tiberius' son and heir. As a result, Germanicus was adopted out of the Claudii and into the Julii. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, he adopted the name [...] "Julius Caesar" [...] while retaining his agnomen, becoming Germanicus Julius Caesar. Upon Germanicus' adoption into the Julii, his brother Claudius became the sole legal representative of his father, and chose to assume the title Germanicus as well.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "It wasn't a perfect episode, mainly because Vivian remains a fairly muddled, bratty villain, and because I don't {{feel like the}} show ever really used Ray Wise <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>full</b> potential. But {{so much of it}} was so satisfying, both emotionally and comedically, that, until Vivian called Chuck during the rehearsal dinner, I actually thought to myself, 'You know, this would be a pretty damn good finale in and of itself. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, [...] "The last act was fairly phenomenal, but we had to get through a lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff {{is at the center of}} three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode. Sarah Stegall of SFScope wrote, [...] "Chuck is killing me by inches. So close, so close to the Chuck/Sarah wedding, but things keep going wrong." ...|$|E
