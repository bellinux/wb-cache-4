5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of <b>the</b> <b>motors.</b> Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
5|$|Four Class 66 {{units were}} {{ordered by the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in 1939, {{to be used as}} express trains on the then newly or shortly-to-be {{electrified}} Sørland- and Østfold Lines. At the same time, similar Class 88 diesel multiple units were ordered for the non-electrified Bergen- and Dovre Lines. The trains were built by Strømmens Værksted, Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The diesel series was assembled by Strømmen, while Skabo assembled the electric version. NEBB delivered <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> for the units.|$|E
5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles {{did not yet}} exist however, and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed {{the idea of a}} caterpillar track for snow surfaces. In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him {{all the way to the}} Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.|$|E
5000|$|The H-bridge {{arrangement}} is generally used {{to reverse the}} polarity/direction of <b>the</b> <b>motor,</b> but {{can also be used}} to 'brake' <b>the</b> <b>motor,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> comes to a sudden stop, as <b>the</b> <b>motor's</b> terminals are shorted, or to let <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> 'free run' to a stop, as <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> is effectively disconnected from the circuit. The following table summarises operation, with S1-S4 corresponding to the diagram above.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>motor</b> drive, gyroscope, {{and display}} {{circuits}} are respectively {{connected to the}} main controller, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>motor</b> drive circuit includes <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> and <b>motor</b> driver. <b>The</b> <b>motor</b> driver adopts a L 298 P drive chip, including an integrated dual H-bridge driver circuit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, a novel {{inertial}} piezoelectric {{rotary motor}} is proposed and its operating principle is introduced. The dynamics model of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> is presented. From the model, the equations {{of the natural}} frequency and mode function of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> are obtained. Using these equations, the natural frequency and mode function of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> are investigated and chosen. A model machine of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> is made and the operating test of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> is done. <b>The</b> test results illustrate the working principle of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> and analytical calculations. <b>The</b> <b>motor</b> structure is quite simple and is favourable to further miniaturize <b>the</b> piezoelectric rotational <b>motor...</b>|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E
40|$|At {{vector control}} of an {{induction}} motor， <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> constants {{are used as}} the control constants. It is desired that <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> constants can be measured prior to the vector control automatically. In this paper， we propose an initial indentification method of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> constants based on Model Reference Adaptive System. The characteristic of this method is to use an inverter which controls the induction motor，and to identify <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> constants without generating <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> torque and rotating <b>the</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>motor</b> {{controller}} regulates <b>the</b> {{power to}} <b>the</b> <b>motor,</b> supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> type, DC or AC.|$|R
50|$|In flux braking the {{increased}} current means increased losses inside <b>the</b> <b>motor.</b> <b>The</b> braking power is therefore also increased although the braking power {{delivered to the}} frequency converter is not increased. The increased current generates increased losses in <b>motor</b> resistances. <b>The</b> higher the resistance value the higher the braking energy dissipation inside <b>the</b> <b>motor.</b> Typically, in low power motors(below 5 kW) the resistance value of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> is relatively large in respect to the nominal current of <b>the</b> <b>motor.</b> <b>The</b> higher the power or the voltage of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>the</b> less the resistance value of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> in respect to motor current.In other words, flux braking is most effective in a low power motor.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, Duewag {{started to}} develop an {{articulated}} variation of its four-axle Großraumwagen, based on articulation technology used by trams in Rome. This design was delivered to many tramways, particularly in Germany. In 1977 and 1978, Oslo Sporveier tested a Duewag GT8S (3052) tram from Rheinbahn. In 1979, Oslo Sporveier ordered ten vehicles from Duewag, with planned delivery in 1982. In addition, fifteen units would be license-built by Strømmens Verkseted, with delivery the following year. All <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> were built by the Norwegian company Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The trams built in Germany were transported to Oslo by railway. The first vehicle was delivered on 13 April 1982 and put into service on 2 July. The last German-built tram was put into service on 13 September. The German trams were numbered 101 through 110. Oslo was the third tramway {{in the world to}} take into use thyristor controlled motors on the main part of their fleet of trams, after the systems in Helsinki, Finland, and Hanover, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E
5|$|Serial {{production}} {{started in}} 1964, with the bodies built at Strømmens Værksted, <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> built by NEBB and the electrical equipment by AEG. By 1978, 162 cars had been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 {{for the opening}} of the Grorud Line and the conversion of the Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1). In 1967, 15 T2s were built for the conversion of the Østensjø Line. Although given a new designation, they are in all ways identical to the T1-1s. From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162.|$|E
50|$|The {{regions of}} the frontal lobe {{responsible}} for <b>motor</b> skill include <b>the</b> primary <b>motor</b> cortex, <b>the</b> supplemental <b>motor</b> area and <b>the</b> premotor cortex. <b>The</b> primary <b>motor</b> cortex {{is located on the}} precentral gyrus and is often visualized as <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> homunculus. By stimulating certain areas of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> strip and observing where it had an effect, Penfield and Rassmussen were able to map out <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> homunculus. Areas on the body that have complex movements, such as the hands, have a bigger representation on <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> homunculus.|$|R
50|$|As an {{unloaded}} DC motor spins, {{it generates}} a backwards-flowing electromotive force that resists the current being applied to <b>the</b> <b>motor.</b> <b>The</b> current through <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> drops as <b>the</b> rotational speed increases, and a free-spinning motor {{has very little}} current. It is only when a load is applied to <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> that slows <b>the</b> rotor that the current draw through <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> increases.|$|R
5000|$|Given a motor {{with mass}} [...] {{attached}} via <b>motor</b> mounts to <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> vibrates as it operates and <b>the</b> soft <b>motor</b> mounts {{act as a}} parallel spring and damper, [...] and [...] The force on <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> mounts is [...] In {{order to reduce the}} maximum force on <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> mounts as <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> operates over a range of speeds, a smaller mass, , is connected to [...] by a spring and a damper, [...] and [...] [...] is the effective force on <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> due to its operation.|$|R
5|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} used by NSB {{was a single}} Di 1 unit delivered in 1942. It was more cost-efficient than the steam locomotives used on the non-electrified lines, and in 1945, NSB decided {{that it would not}} order more steam locomotives. General Motors' Electro Motive Division (EMD) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7, and NSB agreed to lease a single unit for trial. The body and mechanical components were built by NOHAB, <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> by ASEA and prime mover by EMD. While under production in 1954, GM shipped a G12 for trial in Norway and Sweden. It was tested on the express train on the Dovre Line on 7 August, but proved to have insufficient power, causing the train to be 20 minutes late.|$|E
25|$|Static trials {{inside the}} shed began on 13 February 1911. <b>The</b> <b>motors</b> were run and {{controls}} operated, but outdoor trials {{could not be}} carried out until the weather moderated.|$|E
25|$|The first {{commutator}} DC {{electric motor}} capable of turning machinery {{was invented by}} the British scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made {{with the intention of}} commercial use was built by the American inventor Thomas Davenport, which he patented in 1837. <b>The</b> <b>motors</b> ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, <b>the</b> <b>motors</b> were commercially unsuccessful and Davenport went bankrupt. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues. No electricity distribution had been developed at the time. Like Sturgeon's motor, there was no practical commercial market for these motors.|$|E
40|$|A {{substantial}} {{number of studies have}} researched the corporate demand for reinsurance but very few of them have looked into <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> reinsurance market. This dissertation employs a panel data analysis to undertake an empirical investigation into <b>the</b> UK <b>motor</b> reinsurance market in attempt to test whether certain determinants, expressed in related hypotheses, have influences over <b>the</b> demand for <b>motor</b> reinsurance. This dissertation finds that <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> reinsurance price is negatively unit elastic to the demand for <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> reinsurance whereas <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> insurance gross claim, the group membership, and the total asset are positively correlated to the demand for <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> reinsurance...|$|R

50|$|Temperature sensors are {{required}} to protect <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> against overheating. For some applications by other manufacturers, the increase of <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> current is also monitored. Thermoswitches or PTC thermistors which are embedded in <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> windings mostly reliably fulfil this task. They trip when the temperature limit has been exceeded and the controls switch off <b>the</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
25|$|It was {{withdrawn}} from passenger service in 1925, and was converted into snowbroom No. 022 in 1927, {{by removing the}} top deck, fitting brushes under the platforms and increasing the power of <b>the</b> <b>motors.</b> It last saw active service in this state in April 1952.|$|E
25|$|By 2008, Hummer's {{viability}} in {{the economic}} downturn was being questioned, and it was placed under review by GM management. Rather than being transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Motors</b> Liquidation Company {{as part of the}} GM bankruptcy in 2009, the brand was retained by GM, in order to investigate its sale.|$|E
25|$|Despite their diesel engines, {{the trains}} are quite comfortable; even for {{passengers}} sitting directly above <b>the</b> <b>motors,</b> {{the ride is}} quiet and smooth.
