5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage <b>the</b> <b>fellowship,</b> was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of <b>the</b> <b>fellowship.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many filmed scenes remain unused, {{even in the}} Extended Editions.

5|$|Ashurst Turner Gilbert {{was elected}} Principal in 1822, aged only 35; he had secured <b>the</b> <b>fellowship</b> in 1809 on the {{strength}} of a first. He disliked teaching – although he admitted it paid the bills – and much preferred being Principal. There, he would be eventually made Vice-Chancellor of the University and later Bishop of Chichester. Gilbert committed Brasenose to a cause of neutral politics and mainstream Anglicanism, strongly rejecting Tractarian and Evangelical ideas including supporting the censure of Dr. Renn D. Hampden. His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes to religious services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E

5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.

Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} <b>the</b> <b>fellowship,</b> because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people. From 1968 to 1978, he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.|$|E
