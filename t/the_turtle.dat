5|$|In the spring, {{when the}} water reaches , <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> begins {{actively}} foraging. However, if the water temperature exceeds , <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> will not feed. In fall, <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> stops foraging when temperatures drop below the spring set-point.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turtle</b> starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage. After becoming chilled, <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> re-emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding. At night, <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> drops {{to the bottom of}} its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps.|$|E

25|$|Several {{variations}} of turtle racing exist. While turtle racing typically {{takes place on}} land, turtle races have occasionally occurred in pools as well. Some races begin with <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> racing from a starting location and end when they reach a designated finish line. Outdoor races occasionally start <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> in a sunny spot near a shaded area and <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> by nature race into the shade. Other races begin with <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> all being placed {{in the center of}} a large circle, the first to pass outside of the circle is deemed the winner. In some cases, a large lid is placed on top of <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> before <b>the</b> race and the race begins when the lid is lifted off of them. <b>The</b> <b>turtles</b> are often distinguished by numbers painted or taped on their shells.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Turtle</b> was {{the first}} {{submersible}} vessel used for combat {{and led to the}} development of what we know today as the modern submarine, forever changing underwater warfare and the face of naval warfare. As such, <b>the</b> <b>Turtle</b> has been replicated many times to show new audience the roots of submarine technology, how much it has changed, and the influence it has had on modern submarines. By the 1950s, historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited <b>the</b> <b>Turtle</b> as “the greatest of the wartime inventions.” <b>The</b> <b>Turtle</b> remains a source of national as well as regional pride, which led to the construction of several replicas, a number of which exist in Bushnell’s home state of Connecticut. As Benjamin Gale noted in 1775, the vessel was “constructed with great simplicity,” and it has thus inspired at least four replicas. Many of these followed the designs set down by Bushnell, with “precise and comprehensive descriptions of his submarine,” which aided the replication process.|$|E
5|$|The western painted turtle's {{consumption}} {{of plants and}} animals changes seasonally. In early summer, 60% of its diet comprises insects. In late summer, 55% includes plants. Of note, the western painted turtle aids in the dispersal of white water-lily seeds. <b>The</b> <b>turtle</b> consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through <b>the</b> <b>turtle,</b> and disperses them through its feces.|$|E
5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of <b>the</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> in British Columbia.|$|E
5000|$|After {{having a}} {{training}} session, Splinter (Hamato Yoshi) and <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> celebrate their 15th Anniversary of being mutated, and Splinter tells them {{the story of}} how they came to be. After <b>the</b> story, <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> convince Splinter to allow them to travel to the surface. After taking a trip out of the sewers {{for the first time since}} being mutated, <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> must save her and her father. <b>The</b> <b>Turtles</b> have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they still manage to escape with April and Kirby.|$|R
50|$|Armaggon is {{the fifth}} boss up to no good; he's waiting aimlessly for his next bite and has no {{patience}} when <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> approach him. He's defeated and another nuisance happens when the meeting with Wingnut comes. <b>The</b> <b>turtles</b> can not stop his swift movements until Wingnut makes a mistake in pausing for a while depending on his pattern. Wingnut is finished off and General Krang is not impressed with <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> making it thus far. General Krang learns his lesson the hard way as with the previous bosses have and the brothers celebrate too early in result having General Kraang becoming Mega Krang. <b>The</b> <b>Turtles</b> have to use robots to utilize lasers to fire at Mega Krang; lastly, Shredder is annoyed at the failures his subordinates suffered and takes the fight with <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> himself. Shredder proves {{to be more than}} a challenge for <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> but through teamwork and everything else they have experienced, <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> defeat Shredder and save New York City from the Foot clan taking over.|$|R
500|$|Only {{within the}} Pacific Northwest is <b>the</b> <b>turtle's</b> range eroding. Even there, in Washington, <b>the</b> painted <b>turtle</b> is {{designated}} S5 (demonstrably widespread). However, in Oregon, <b>the</b> painted <b>turtle</b> is designated S2 (imperiled), and in British Columbia, <b>the</b> <b>turtle's</b> populations in <b>the</b> Coast and Interior regions are labeled [...] "endangered" [...] and [...] "of special concern", respectively.|$|R
5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> {{said it was too}} cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. <b>The</b> <b>turtle</b> also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Roy Manstan, Fred Frese, and the Naval Underwater Warfare Center {{partnered with}} {{students}} from Old Saybrook High School in Connecticut on a four-year project called <b>The</b> <b>Turtle</b> Project, to construct their own working replica, which they completed and launched in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Lachrymal glands located {{behind each}} eye allow the loggerhead to {{maintain}} osmotic balance {{by eliminating the}} excess salt obtained from ingesting ocean water. On land, the excretion of excess salt gives the false impression that <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> is crying.|$|E
50|$|The {{archipelago}} {{is home to}} <b>the</b> hawksbill <b>turtle,</b> <b>the</b> flatback <b>turtle</b> and <b>the</b> green <b>turtle</b> {{although none}} are known to nest on Abutilon.|$|R
50|$|Not all nests are emptied by {{the park}} rangers, but some remain {{undisturbed}} and develop naturally. By conserving <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> <b>the</b> park {{does not want}} to endanger other wildlife on the island: many animals that are natural predators of <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> such as monitor lizards, a crab specialising in turtle hatchlings, eagles and other birds, and marine animals such as sharks. They need <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> for their survival.|$|R
50|$|While in lock-up, Mike recounts how <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> {{got their}} colors: Three thugs stole a chip {{and used the}} sewers to escape, {{interrupting}} <b>the</b> <b>Turtle's</b> training. <b>The</b> thugs shot at <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> fought back. After dispatching the thugs, Master Splinter mistakenly scolded Don because they were all wearing red masks, so he couldn't tell them apart. After Mike accidentally broke a vase but wouldn't take the blame, they were all punished. They {{came up with a}} plan to take the tests that they each excelled at. Master Splinter realized their deception and {{came up with a plan}} to trick them. In the next test he only gave Mike the perfect score so that the brothers would fight amongst themselves. The thugs came back looking for the lost chip. <b>The</b> <b>Turtles</b> defeated them and turned them in to <b>the</b> cops. <b>The</b> <b>Turtles</b> came up with colored caps to identify themselves, but later changed to their colored masks and initialed belts.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> spotted <b>turtle</b> {{and painted}} turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to <b>the</b> bog <b>turtle.</b> <b>The</b> bog <b>turtle</b> is distinguishable from any other species of <b>turtle</b> by <b>the</b> distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference between it and <b>the</b> spotted <b>turtle</b> is that <b>the</b> bog <b>turtle</b> has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, {{the genus}} Clemmys {{consisted}} of four species (bog turtle, spotted turtle, western pond <b>turtle,</b> and <b>the</b> wood <b>turtle).</b> Recent genetic analyses {{have revealed that}} <b>the</b> spotted <b>turtle</b> is distinct from the other three species. <b>The</b> bog <b>turtle</b> and <b>the</b> wood <b>turtle</b> were moved to the genus Glyptemys, while <b>the</b> western pond <b>turtle</b> has been renamed Actinemys. This makes <b>the</b> spotted <b>turtle</b> <b>the</b> sole member of the genus Clemmys.|$|R

5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on <b>the</b> <b>turtle</b> ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
5|$|More than 100 {{species of}} animals from 13 phyla, {{as well as}} 37 kinds of algae, live on loggerheads' backs.

5000|$|Saki {{also sought}} vengeance {{for his brother}} and, using the persona of [...] "The Shredder", he assassinated Yoshi and Shen. Over a decade later, <b>the</b> Ninja <b>Turtles</b> {{challenged}} Shredder to a rooftop duel to avenge Yoshi and Shen. Shredder sent his Foot Ninja to fight <b>the</b> <b>Turtles,</b> but they were no match for <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> and were eventually defeated. Shredder then fought <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> himself, and although he was a more skilled ninja than them, he was killed when he fell off a building carrying a grenade.In the issues later Shredder was revived to take revenge on <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> and then revived again as a clone made of worms with mutating as a shark before perishing for good.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Turtles</b> also gain a new nemesis in {{the form}} of Sh'Okanabo, an alien warlord who seeks to conquer the Earth so his species, the Kanabo, can {{reproduce}} and thrive on the planet. Sh'Okanabo enters a partnership with Darius Dunn, both seeking to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Turtles,</b> and Sh'Okanabo creates <b>the</b> Dark <b>Turtles,</b> which are four malicious clones of <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> to battle them. Dunn also gives Sh'Okanabo the plans to Cody's time window, and the alien is able to manufacture a second one, but it malfunctions, creating a storm of time windows that transport beings from all across time in New York - resulting in a brief face-off between <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> and <b>the</b> Shredder from their time, before he is returned to his own time. <b>The</b> <b>Turtles,</b> Cody and Sh'Okanabo are briefly able to repair the villain's time window, but it malfunctions yet again, seemingly killing the alien warlord.|$|R
5|$|Pollock's {{remaining}} time {{as governor}} was less eventful. While exploring Tonga in May 1923, he discovered a turtle {{which had been}} branded by Captain Cook on his expedition there in 1773. <b>The</b> <b>turtle</b> was thus known to have lived more than 150 years. He was ordered home on July 26, 1923.|$|E
5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. <b>The</b> <b>turtle</b> holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims {{the surface of the water}} with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turtle</b> {{has a low}} {{reproduction}} rate; females lay one clutch per year, with {{an average}} of three eggs each. The young tend to grow rapidly, reaching sexual maturity between the ages of 4 and 10years old. Bog turtles live for an average of 20to 30years in the wild. Since 1973, the Bronx Zoo has successfully bred bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> 2009 film <b>Turtles</b> Forever, <b>the</b> later 2003 <b>Turtles</b> also {{encounter}} Krang, {{who eventually}} aids <b>the</b> <b>turtles</b> in defeating Utrom Shredder. <b>The</b> 2012 <b>Turtles</b> would face Krang themselves when he {{teamed up with}} the Kraang who served as their antagonists.|$|R
5000|$|Counting {{from the}} first meeting with <b>the</b> <b>Turtles,</b> Shredder spent eight seasons {{plotting}} ways to defeat them. In the season 8 episode [...] "Turtle Trek", <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> destroy <b>the</b> engines of the Technodrome, trapping it and its inhabitants in Dimension X for good and {{putting an end to}} Shredder's plans. He spent the next two seasons in Dimension X, until he was contacted by Dregg ("The Power of Three"). Dregg arranged for him and Krang to come back to Earth, to help him fight <b>the</b> <b>Turtles.</b> Together, they capture <b>the</b> <b>Turtles,</b> but Dregg then betrays them and tries to drain the life energy of <b>the</b> <b>Turtles,</b> Krang, and Shredder all at once, making them weaker while Dregg becomes stronger. Shredder alone escapes the trap and restores Krang ("A Turtle in Time"), but Dregg captures them again. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> spoil Dregg's plan and transport Shredder and Krang back to Dimension X ("Turtles to the Second Power"). In the series finale [...] "Divide and Conquer", <b>the</b> <b>Turtles</b> return to <b>the</b> Technodrome in Dimension X to take Krang's android body, which they need to fight Dregg.
