5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of {{religious}} studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement. Its practitioners model their faith on the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe. To reconstruct <b>these</b> <b>past</b> belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.|$|E

25|$|In late 1972, Nixon had {{appointed}} Helms as Ambassador to Iran. During {{his confirmation}} hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in February, 1973, Helms was questioned concerning the CIA's earlier role in Chile. Because <b>these</b> <b>past</b> operations were then still effectively a state secret, {{and because the}} Senate hearings were public events, Helms, following past Congressional understandings with the CIA, in effect, denied that the CIA had, in 1970, aided the Chilean opponents of President-elect Allende.|$|E
25|$|Forward secrecy is a {{property}} of cryptographic systems which ensures that a session key {{derived from a}} set {{of public and private}} keys will not be compromised if one of the private keys is compromised in the future. Without forward secrecy, if the server's private key is compromised, not only will all future TLS-encrypted sessions using that server certificate be compromised, but also any past sessions that used it as well (provided of course that <b>these</b> <b>past</b> sessions were intercepted and stored at the time of transmission). An implementation of TLS can provide forward secrecy by requiring the use of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish session keys, and some notable TLS implementations do so exclusively: e.g., Gmail and other Google HTTPS services that use OpenSSL. However, many clients and servers supporting TLS (including browsers and web servers) are not configured to implement such restrictions. In practice, unless a web service uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange to implement forward secrecy, all of the encrypted web traffic to and from that service can be decrypted by a third party if it obtains the server's master (private) key; e.g., by means of a court order.|$|E

500|$|John Lent, {{a scholar}} of comics, {{described}} Kampung Boy: Yesterday and Today as Lat's [...] "crowning achievement".

[...] It explores in greater detail the games played by Lat and his friends and the lifestyle {{they had in the}} 1960s. [...] However, Yesterday and Today also compares <b>these</b> <b>past</b> events to similar occurrences in the 1980s and '90s, contrasting the two in a humorous light; the opposition of the two time frames is further enhanced by rendering the portrayals of contemporary scenes in watercolour while those of the past remain in black and white.

500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I worked like crazy <b>these</b> <b>past</b> twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
500|$|The final chapter, [...] "The Rebellion of the Tools", {{seeks to}} answer the final Gauguin question, 'where are we going?', by {{applying}} <b>these</b> <b>past</b> examples to modern society. Technological advancements in bio-engineering, nanotechnology, cybernetics, amongst others, {{have the potential to}} be progress traps, and the global scale of modern society means that a societal collapse could impact all of mankind. Wright sees needed reforms being blocked by vested interests who reject multi-lateral organisations, and support laissez-faire economics and transfers of power to corporations as leading to the social and environmental degradations that led to the collapse of previous civilisations. Necessary reforms are, in Wright's view, being blocked by vested interests who are hostile to change, including American market extremists. Wright concludes that [...] "our present behaviour is typical of failed societies at the zenith of their greed and arrogance" [...] and calls for a shift towards long-term thinking: ...|$|E
500|$|Practitioners seek {{to revive}} <b>these</b> <b>past</b> belief systems by using {{surviving}} historical source materials. Among the historical sources used are Old Norse texts from Scandinavia and Iceland {{such as the}} Prose Edda and Poetic Edda, Old English texts such as Beowulf, and Middle High German texts such as the Nibelungenlied. Some Heathens also adopt ideas from the archaeological evidence of pre-Christian Northern Europe and from recorded folk tales and folklore from later periods in European history. The textual sources nevertheless remain problematic {{as a means of}} [...] "reconstructing" [...] pre-Christian belief systems, because they were written by Christians and only discuss pre-Christian religion in a fragmentary and biased manner. The anthropologist Jenny Blain characterises Heathenry as [...] "a religion constructed from partial material", while the religious studies scholar Michael Strmiska describes its beliefs as being [...] "riddled with uncertainty and historical confusion", thereby characterising it as a postmodern movement.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} song was mostly positive. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy commended the balladry on Talk That Talk, paying particular attention to [...] "Fool in Love" [...] and [...] "Farewell", writing [...] "anyone questioning her motives need only hear ballads 'Farewell' and 'Fool in Love' to find out not only does she have a heart, but she's without doubt been putting all of it into <b>these</b> <b>past</b> six years." [...] Robert Everett-Green for The Globe and Mail praised the song, writing [...] "Fool in Love rings down the curtain with a towering anthem that somehow squeezes fresh feeling from a tired lyrical concept." [...] Katherine St Asaph for Popdust emoted a mixed response to [...] "Fool in Love", giving the song {{three and a half}} stars out of five and writing that it is [...] "so-bad-it's-good". St Aspash praised [...] "Fool in Love" [...] composition and musical influences, but criticized the song as not providing [...] "dynamic variety" [...] amongst Talk That Talk material.|$|E
500|$|During {{his service}} as ambassador, Hay {{attempted}} {{to advance the}} relationship between the U.S. and Britain. The latter country had long been seen negatively by many Americans, a legacy of its colonial role that was refreshed by its Civil War neutrality, when British-built raiders such as the Alabama preyed on US-flagged ships. In spite of <b>these</b> <b>past</b> differences, according to Taliaferro, [...] "rapprochement made more sense {{than at any time in}} their respective histories". In his Thanksgiving Day address to the American Society in London in 1897, Hay echoed these points, [...] "The great body of people in the United States and England are friends... that intense respect and reverence for order, liberty, and law which is so profound a sentiment in both countries". Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador, both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success, because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations.|$|E
500|$|A {{factor of}} great {{conflict}} all over Eora is the recent scientific discovery that souls are not mere metaphysical abstractions, but quantifiable, measurable objects {{that can be}} transferred, stored, or molded. Souls are the basis of magic, as accessing their power is what allows certain people to use it. Souls leave the body upon death, and go through a largely unknown process before reincarnating into a newborn body. Every soul does, however, have embedded memories from their previous lives, and through certain processes a person's soul can be [...] "Awakened," [...] meaning they gain awareness of <b>these</b> <b>past</b> lives. There are also {{people in the world}} who have the supernatural ability to perceive people's souls, which allows them to access past memories, among other things; these individuals are called [...] "Watchers." [...] Though the study of souls, called animancy, is still a young field of science, the implications for society at large has been vast, led to rapid advances in technology, and caused several rifts and clashes in the different religious communities, which has marked the era as a time of great turmoil.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana has certainly been not-exactly-cuddly <b>these</b> <b>past</b> few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman {{found the}} episode [...] "completely absurd" [...] but [...] "brillantly entertaining." [...] Morgan Glennon of BuddyTV wrote, [...] "Despite how ridiculous it was seeing {{character}} after character after character {{try to save}} Blair from her own stupid decisions, Gossip Girl really {{knows how to do}} big events. After 100 episodes, the show understood that it needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, was as big, dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best." [...] Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode, [...] "you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene." [...] However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers [...] "should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling" [...] of Gossip Girl and questioned, [...] "isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over <b>these</b> <b>past</b> four and a half years? That constant need of this once-promising show to tip its hand too soon?" [...] and concluded [...] "we think the time has finally come to remove Gossip Girl from our bookmarks." ...|$|E
500|$|McMahon {{commented that}} the SIS {{had a history of}} [...] "furnish {{unreliable}} information on the IRA's foreign intrigues." [...] Yet, <b>these</b> <b>past</b> failures were ignored as the reports reinforced the fears of invasion. MaMahon suggested that [...] "It is even possible that the plans discovered in Holland were planted. Whether deliberate deception or not, British intelligence was well and truly deceived." [...] Historian Eunan O'Halpin argued that while the Dutch document could be seen as a British fabrication, [...] "it is now known... that German deception operations prepared in anticipation of Operation 'Sealion' included the manufacturing of rumours and stories of plans to attack Ireland as a feint during the build up to an invasion of Southern England." [...] Nicholas Mansergh commented that [...] "Ireland had no place" [...] in the initial Sealion plans, and it was not until 3 December 1940 that German planners even looked at the possibility before concluding that such an operation was not possible or if launched would result in failure. In his memoirs, Carton De Wiart commented [...] "I can never believe the Germans had any intention of invading Ireland but I am very grateful for any reason which sent us there, for it was an ideal training ground for troops and the division improved enormously from the moment of our arrival." ...|$|E
