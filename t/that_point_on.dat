5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|According to news reports, {{the first}} {{passenger}} trains {{left the city}} at 9:00am, and continued running throughout the day. Around 10:00am, General W. S. Hancock arrived and was followed by 360–400 federal troops from New York and Fort Monroe, who relieved those guarding Camden Station. They brought with them two 12 pounder artillery pieces. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> {{the men of the}} 5th and the federal troops took turns guarding the station.|$|E
5|$|As a male-line {{grandchild}} of the British monarch, Victoria Melita {{bore the}} royal arms, with an inescutcheon for Saxony, the whole differenced by a label of five points argent, the outer pair bearing hearts gules, the inner pair anchors azure, {{and the central}} point a cross gules. In 1917, the inescutcheon was dropped by royal warrant. Her arms from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> are duplicated {{in the arms of}} Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.|$|E

5|$|Dylan first {{performed}} the song live on November 21, 1978, in El Paso, Texas, and again, two days later, in Norman, Oklahoma. He {{did not play}} it in concert again until July 19, 1987, in Eugene, Oregon; from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> he has often included the song in his sets. According to his official website, as of November 2017 Dylan has {{performed the}} song exactly 500 times.|$|E
5|$|García {{moved in}} with his uncle Pedro Ortiz when his parents divorced. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> his uncle brought him to Arena México, home of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), for whom Ortiz worked at the time.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes {{cardinal}} orientation and is signed as east–west from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on.</b> The freeway continues {{parallel to the}} Looking Glass River through suburban areas north of Capital Region International Airport. North of East Lansing, I-69 meets US127 at a cloverleaf interchange. East of that junction, I-69 turns southeasterly passing the Hawk Hollow Golf Course and Park Lake {{on the way to}} meet the eastern end of BL I-69 just north of Lake Lansing. I-69 then turns northeasterly parallel to Lansing Road (Old M-78) to enter Shiawassee County. The freeway continues through Central Michigan farmlands, jogging north of Perry and Bancroft.|$|E
5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
50|$|A direct {{implication}} of this definition is <b>that</b> every <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the surface is a saddle point with equal and opposite principal curvatures.|$|R
50|$|Computer {{simulations}} show <b>that</b> <b>points</b> <b>on</b> a plane tend to form alignments {{similar to}} those found by ley hunters in numbers consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates above, suggesting that ley lines may also be generated by chance. This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the points are generated pseudo-randomly by computer, or from data sets of mundane features such as pizza restaurants or telephone booths.|$|R

5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would {{have to take care of}} 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on)</b> would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
5|$|From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> the Colts {{took over}} the game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts {{defensive}} back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 yards to the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.|$|E
5|$|He went to Primary School in St. Annes Primary School, Navan. Brosnan's father {{abandoned}} the family when Pierce was an infant. When {{he was four}} years old, his mother moved to London {{to work as a}} nurse. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> he was largely brought up by his grandparents, Philip and Kathleen Smith. After their deaths, he lived with an aunt and then an uncle, but was subsequently sent to live in a boarding house run by a woman named Eileen.|$|E

She was {{selected}} in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games purely as a relay swimmer, winning gold in the event. At her second Olympic Games, the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, she only competed in the 4 × 100 relay heats; her teammates went on to win silver in the final. She retired from competitive swimming following the Rome Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> {{was more of a}} political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car {{in which}} Baba was being driven went {{out of control and}} a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move. In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{azimuthal}} {{equidistant projection}} is an azimuthal map projection. It has the useful properties <b>that</b> all <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the map are at proportionately correct distances {{from the center}} <b>point,</b> and <b>that</b> all <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the map are at the correct azimuth (direction) from the center point. A useful application {{for this type of}} projection is a polar projection which shows all meridians (lines of longitude) as straight, with distances from the pole represented correctly. The flag of the United Nations contains an example of a polar azimuthal equidistant projection.|$|R

5|$|The Longhorns scored ten{{touchdown}}s {{in their}} first elevenpossessions. They started with first-quarter touchdowns by Henry Melton and Jamaal Charles. The Buffaloes got their only score of the game, a field goal, {{at the start of}} the secondquarter. Vince Young, Limas Sweed, David Thomas, and Jamaal Charles scored touchdowns in the secondquarter to give the Horns a 42–3 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Selvin Young, Charles and Melton each scored rushing touchdowns. Brandon Foster scored a touchdown on defense due to Michael Griffin blocking a Colorado punt. Halfway through the third quarter, Texas already had 70 points, but went on cruise control from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> and did not score again.|$|E
