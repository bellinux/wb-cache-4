25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is not}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, {{from the end of}} 1759 to the end of 1761, the unshakable {{firmness}} of the Russian Empress was the one constraining political force which held together the heterogeneous, incessantly jarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination. From the Russian point of view Elizabeth's greatness as a stateswoman consists in her steady appreciation of Russian interests, and her determination to promote them at all hazards. She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbors for the future, and {{that the only way to}} bring this about was to reduce him to the rank of a Prince-Elector.|$|E
25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E
500|$|After the Denning Report, in {{defiance}} of general expectations that he would resign shortly, Macmillan announced his intention to stay on. On {{the eve of the}} Conservative Party's annual conference in October 1963 he fell ill; his condition was less serious than he imagined, and his life was not in danger [...] but, convinced he had cancer, he resigned abruptly. [...] His successor as prime minister was Lord Home, who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In the October 1964 general election the Conservative Party was narrowly defeated, and Wilson became prime minister. A later commentator opined that the Profumo affair had destroyed the old, aristocratic Conservative party: [...] "It wouldn't be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the Profumo scandal was the necessary prelude to the new Toryism, based on meritocracy, which would eventually emerge under Margaret Thatcher". The Economist suggested that the Profumo affair had effected a fundamental and permanent change in relations between politicians and press. Davenport-Hines posits a longer-term consequence of the affair—the gradual ending of traditional notions of deference: [...] "Authority, however disinterested, well-qualified and experienced, was [...] increasingly greeted with suspicion rather than trust".|$|E

500|$|Steven Spielberg's 2012 film Lincoln, {{in which}} Stevens was portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, brought new public {{interest}} in Stevens. Jones's character is portrayed as the central figure among the radicals, responsible in large part for {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment. [...] Historian Matthew Pinsker notes that Stevens is referred to only four times in [...] Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals on which screenwriter Tony Kushner based the film's screenplay; other radicals were folded into the character. [...] Stevens is depicted as unable to moderate his views for the sake of gaining passage of the amendment until after he is urged to do so by the ever-compromising Lincoln. According to Aaron Bady in his article about the film and how it portrays the radicals, [...] "he's the uncle everyone is embarrassed of, even if they love him <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so. He's not a leader, he's a liability, one whose shining heroic moment will be when he keeps silent about what he really believes." [...] The film depicts a Stevens–Smith sexual relationship; Pinsker comments that [...] "it may well have been true that they were lovers, but by injecting this issue into the movie, the filmmakers risk leaving the impression for some viewers that the 'secret' reason for Stevens's egalitarianism was his desire to legitimize his romance across racial lines." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{role that}} Wills and others played in {{pioneering}} Australian football went largely unrecognised in their lifetimes as the sport {{had yet to}} develop a historical perspective. In an 1876 piece on the Melbourne Football Club's origins, published in The Australasian, Wills' 1858 letter calling for the organisation and codification of football was noted as a seminal document. Wills later wrote that he attempted to promote football in Victoria as early as 1857, [...] "but it was not taken to kindly until the following year". By 1908, the year of Australian football's jubilee celebrations, H. C. A. Harrison was proclaimed [...] "the father of football" [...] {{on account of his}} substantial reputation on and off the field. Wills was the next most often recalled pioneer during this period, and Harrison credited him with initiating the sport when he [...] "recommended that we Australians should work out a game of our own." [...] More recent historiography has shown that while Harrison was a pivotal figure over a long period, he did not co-write the first rules in 1859 and did not play in the 1858 games. With this correction, Wills was elevated to a position of pre-eminence. He has variously been called the game's father and inventor. Blainey said of Wills: [...] "It is far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he founded the game, but it would be too little {{to say that he was}} simply one among many founders." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Australian {{team made}} a {{positive}} {{impression on the}} New Zealand public during the tour and Campese was among those celebrated for his entertaining style of play. New Zealand rugby journalist Terry McLean, in the New Zealand Herald, wrote after the tour that, [...] "It would not be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that this was the}} most significant Wallaby team ever to tour New Zealand." [...] McLean praised Campese, stating that he [...] "could side-step his way out of a sealed paper bag".

2500|$|Of his ability, Arthur Budd, {{president}} of the RFU from 1888 to 1889, said in 1892 that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} there is a three-quarter back playing, who, if we could transplant him to the past, could cover the entire field as Lennard Stokes used to.", and Arthur Guillemard, {{president of}} the RFU from 1878 to 1882, said, also in 1892, [...] "it is not <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that at this post his equal, either in science or play, has never been seen from the date of the foundation of the Union.". Steve Lewis, author of numerous books on the history of rugby union, commented that [...] "It was with much justification that he was hailed as the greatest player of his day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marlowe {{found most}} of his {{material}} for this play in the third volume of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles (1587). Frederick Boas believes that [...] "out of all the rich material provided by Holinshed" [...] Marlowe was drawn to [...] "the comparatively unattractive reign of Edward II" [...] due {{to the relationship between}} the King and Gaveston. Boas elaborates, [...] "Homosexual affection ... has (as has been seen) a special attraction for Marlowe. Jove and Ganymede in Dido, Henry III and his 'minions' in The Massacre, Neptune and Leander in Hero and Leander, and all akin, although drawn to a slighter scale, to Edward and Gaveston." [...] Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between Edward II and The Massacre at Paris, asserting that [...] "it is scarcely <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that scenes xi–xxi of The Massacre are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for Edward II." [...] Marlowe stayed close to the account but embellished it with the character of Lightborn (or Lucifer) as Edward's assassin.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Robert Quimby says, [...] "the British {{certainly}} did win a tactical victory, which {{enabled them to}} maintain their position." [...] However, Quimby goes on to say, [...] "It is not <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that it was the}} battle of December 23 that saved New Orleans. The British were disabused of their expectation of an easy conquest. The unexpected and severe attack made Keane even more cautious...he made no effort to advance on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth." [...] As a consequence, the Americans were given time to begin the transformation of the canal into a heavily fortified earthwork. On Christmas Day, General Edward Pakenham arrived on the battlefield and ordered a reconnaissance-in-force on December 28 against the American earthworks protecting the advance to New Orleans. That evening, General Pakenham, angry with the position in which the army had been placed, met with General Keane and Admiral Cochrane for an update on the situation. General Pakenham wanted to use Chef Menteur Road as the invasion route, but he was overruled by Admiral Cochrane, who insisted that his boats were providing everything that could be needed. Admiral Cochrane believed the veteran British soldiers would easily destroy Jackson's ramshackle army, and he allegedly said that if the army did not do it, his sailors would. Whatever Pakenham's thoughts on the matter, the meeting settled the method and place of the attack.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} for Hood and Sullivan of The Rose of Persia, the pair were soon writing a second opera, The Emerald Isle (1901). Sullivan died while writing this new work, however, {{and the task}} of {{completing}} it fell to Edward German. The production was another reasonable success, with 205 performances. Hood wrote that, {{at the time of}} Sullivan's death, he and Sullivan had also begun work on a serious opera. Hood and German went on to collaborate on the successful Merrie England (1902), which played at the Savoy for 120 performances, toured the provinces for 14 weeks, and then returned for another run at the Savoy. Of Merrie England, The Observer wrote, [...] "It is not <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Capt. Basil Hood and Mr. Edward German have, by means of the latest Savoy success, increased their reputations to an extent that will lead the musical public to look to them in future for work as epoch-making in its peculiar genre as that of Gilbert and Sullivan. Capt. Hood is the only writer of [...] "words for music" [...] whose lyrics can compare with those of Mr. Gilbert for finish, rhythmic piquancy, and verbal quaintness." [...] Another piece in 1902, My Pretty Maid, starring Edward Terry, lasted less than two months. When Merrie England finished its second London run, German and Hood immediately followed it with A Princess of Kensington (1903) which ran for 115 performances and then went on tour. After that, their producer, William Greet, turned away from light opera, which effectively ended their work together.|$|E
