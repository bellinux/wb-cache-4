CR {{frequency}} assignment represents {{the core of}} the cognitive radio process, since its unique features, along with reconfigurability and learning, make the cognitive radio what it is. The {{frequency assignment}} (FA) problem in wireless communications is well-studied, due to the extensive research of FA in mobile radio networks, wireless mesh networks, broadcasting networks, or in military applications [4 – 6]. Most of these studies do not consider primary-secondary spectrum sharing nor the dynamic availability of the spectrum due to the presence of primary users. <b>Taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look into these research approaches, we can deduce that the cognitive radio FA has many unique and specific features, which makes CR unsuitable for transposition of the same FA models and algorithms from other types of wireless networks.|$|R

30|$|By <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look at such mechanisms, recent {{literature}} has illuminated {{the role of}} unit coordination. Zoogah et al. (2011, p. 254) described coordination as “a behavioral mechanism that facilitates transformation of team inputs to outputs (Kozlowski and Bell 2003) and can facilitate team performance.” They point to the special importance of coordination for diverse work units, as those units must align their behaviors, goals, and activities in order to manage their interdependencies. By examining their assumptions within a sample of strategic alliance teams, they found robust support for the moderating role of coordination between gender diversity and team effectiveness and partial support for the moderating role of coordination between nationality diversity/functional diversity and team effectiveness. In addition, conceptual research has underscored the importance of relational coordination capabilities, as {{they are likely to}} promote social integration and well-being in diverse units (van Knippenberg et al. 2013; Guillaume et al. 2017).|$|R

60|$|There {{is still}} another and highly {{effective}} cause, {{leading to the}} mouth being opened, when we are astonished, and more especially when we are suddenly startled. We can draw a full and deep inspiration much more easily through the widely open mouth than through the nostrils. Now when we start at any sudden sound or sight, almost all {{the muscles of the}} body are involuntarily and momentarily thrown into strong action, for the sake of guarding ourselves against or jumping away from the danger, which we habitually associate with anything unexpected. But we always unconsciously prepare ourselves for any great exertion, as formerly explained, by first <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> and full inspiration, and we consequently open our mouths. If no exertion follows, and we still remain astonished, we cease for a time to breathe, or breathe as quietly as possible, in order that every sound may be distinctly heard. Or again, if our attention continues long and earnestly absorbed, all our muscles become relaxed, and the jaw, which was at first suddenly opened, remains dropped. Thus several causes concur towards this same movement, whenever surprise, astonishment, or amazement is felt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. - <b>Taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> {{look at the}} {{fundamental}} force of gravity one arrives at {{the conclusion that it}} is quite an unusual field because it does not have a fermion associated to it. And the absence of such fermion shadows the existence of the graviton itself. Therefore, gravity quantization is also doubtful. Keyworks: gravity quantization, graviton, PCAS Nos. : 96. 40. Tv; 13. 15. +g; 14. 60. Lm Any elementary particle is either a boson or a fermion. Bosons are mediators of the interactions and fermions are carriers of the quantized charges. As an example in the electromagnetic interaction the electron current is given by j µ V = eψγµ ψ (1) where e is the quantum of charge, and ψ is the fermion Dirac spinor of the electron.

The basic question asks if this process resembles time-dependent picing models, or if it resembles more a state-dependent process. This is done analysing a series of random effects regressions to explore the relations between inflation rate, frequency of pricing adjustments and their average magnitude. The main conclusions are that 1) there is considerable heterogeneity between product categories, 2) price decreases follow a very stable pattern that does not depend on the overall inflation rate, 3) the average size of the price increases is influenced by a very small magnitude by the inflation rate, 4) the proportion of prices increasing each month is strongly positively correlated with the inflation rate, and 5) state-dependent specifications fit better these facts...|$|R
