5|$|Architects were HRTB and {{the main}} {{contractor}} was NCC Construction. While domed stadiums have been common in North America, no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007. However, because of the building boom, concrete elements needed for construction to start meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction was delayed. The cornerstone was laid on 5 September.|$|E

5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E

5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
5|$|Drowned God was {{released}} on October31, 1996 for the Windows 95 operating system. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000copies in the United States. It {{was one of the}} top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it to fall out of favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story would be revealed in a sequel called CULT, planned to center around Area51.

5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} {{in the same}} way <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E

A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up.

5|$|However, retired Colonel Thomas H. Taylor, a {{military}} historian, contended in his 1996 book {{that in spite}} of their original purpose of short range infiltration, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was employed well for the missions they conducted, most of which were reactionary and borne out of a need to rapidly counter North Korean and Chinese attacks. Taylor noted that particularly in their earlier missions, the Rangers had been successful at operating as a night combat force, a skill <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. forces in Korea were largely untrained in. Taylor also believed that the Rangers, who were drawn from replacement and occupation units in Japan, effectively gave the 25th Infantry Division an extra force it would not otherwise have possessed, allowing it to employ its conventional forces elsewhere. Taylor praised division commander Major General William B. Kean for his employment of the Rangers, and argued that the successes of the subsequent Ranger companies validated the existence of the Eighth Army Ranger Company.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, finials and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the loggia design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. Wall tiles were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E
5|$|In October 1992, TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment were {{planning}} to start production on Zorro the following year, and hired Joel Gross to rewrite the script after they were impressed with his adaptation of The Three Musketeers. At the time, Spielberg was producing Zorro {{with the potential to}} direct. Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993, and TriStar entered pre-production, creating early promotion for the film that same month at the ShoWest trade show. By December 1993, Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg, and Mikael Salomon was attached as director. In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 start date.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, the {{municipal}} government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating {{to share the}} spoils of political office. In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians; the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate. The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo, provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ticket was to his liking. When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent. He took office January 2, 1882.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{airborne}} assault on 20 May, the 2/7th became heavily engaged fighting German parachute troops around Canea. It then undertook a local counter-attack at 42nd Street {{during which the}} 2/7th launched a ferocious bayonet charge {{in concert with the}} New Zealand Maori Battalion that resulted in heavy German casualties. The 2/7th later covered the withdrawal to Sphakia where the Royal Navy attempted to evacuate the garrison by the sea, undertaking a three-day stand in the hills, before they were ordered down to the evacuation beaches. As Allied naval losses mounted the operation was called off before the 2/7th could embark. As a result, most of the battalion – over 400 personnel – was taken prisoner. Several 2/7th soldiers later escaped captivity; one of them, John Peck, became part of a Special Operations Executive team responsible for helping Allied prisoners of war escape. The battalion's commanding officer, Walker, was one of those captured, giving up his position on one of the last evacuation ships when it became apparent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battalion would not have time to get clear. Walker remained in captivity {{until the end of the}} war, along with many others of the battalion who went to prisoner of war camps in Greece, Germany, Austria and Poland.|$|E
