40|$|Trying {{criminal}} cases is hard. The problem faced {{by a judge}} in court can be phrased in a deceptively simple way though, as follows: in order {{to come to a}} verdict, a judge has to apply <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to <b>the</b> facts of the case. In a naïve and often criticized model of legal decision making (reminding of the bouche de la loi view on judges), the verdict is determined by applying <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that match <b>the</b> case facts. This naïve model of legal decision making can be referred to as the subsumption model. A problem with the subsumption model is that neither <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> nor <b>the</b> case facts are available to the legal decision maker in a sufficiently well-structured form to make the processes of matching and applying a trivial matter. First, there is the problem <b>of</b> determining what <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and <b>the</b> case facts are. Neither <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> nor <b>the</b> facts are presented to the judge in a precise and unambiguous way. A judge has to interpret the available information about <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and <b>the</b> case facts. Second, even if <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and <b>the</b> case facts would be determined, the processes of matching and applying can be problematic. It can for instance be undetermined whether some case fact falls under a particular rule's condition. Additional classificatory rules are then needed. In general, it can be the case that applying <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> leads to conflicting verdicts about the case at hand, or to no verdict at all. In the latter situation, it is to the judge's discretion to fill the gap, in the former, he has to resolve the conflict...|$|R

40|$|This {{framework}} paper {{sets out}} the multiple angles {{from which the}} interfaces between the national and international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> can be analysed.

It moves on to discuss the ‘national’ reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (Section III), <b>the</b> points of connection between the national and international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (Section IV), and the ‘international’ reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (Section V). <b>The</b> paper concludes with a theoretical and normative assessment of the interfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfaces}} between {{national and}} international law have significantly evolved due to subject-matter overlap between {{national and international}} <b>law.</b> The restriction <b>of</b> governmental authority by the ‘rule of law’ is no exception in this regard. International scholarship has so far largely examined the national reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Much less recognised is the international perspective: namely, as to how <b>the</b> international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> understands, accepts, or resists <b>the</b> national <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> This paper examines the international reception <b>of</b> national <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> practices within a specific regulatory context of UN targeted sanctions. Member states’ exercise of authority and the UN Security Council’s listing decisions bear resemblance to each other, which creates the conditions for the interfaces between the national and international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> A series <b>of</b> judicial contestations formally based on <b>the</b> national <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> were translated into normative, theoretical, and political forces at the international level, leading to the generation and materialisation {{of the principles of}} fairness and transparency as one of the elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively. The most common criticism {{has been of}} the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> although the advancement of human rights {{is seen as a}} positive feature also associated with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged.|$|E
