50|$|After St Martin {{had left}} the city, the emperor {{appointed}} the Prefect Evodius as judge. He found Priscillian and some others {{guilty of the crime}} of magic. This decision was reported to the emperor, who killed Priscillian and several of his followers; the property of others was confiscated and they were banished. The conduct of Ithacius immediately met with the severest reprobation. St Martin, hearing what had taken place, returned to Trier and compelled the emperor <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> <b>an</b> <b>order</b> to the military tribunes, already on their way to Iberia to extirpate the heresy. There is no ground in the condemnation and death of Priscillian for the charge made against the Church of having invoked the civil authority to punish heretics. The pope censured not only the actions of Ithacius but also that of the emperor. St Ambrose was equally stern in his denunciation of the case and some of the Gallican bishops, who were in Trier under the leadership of Theognistus, broke off communion with Ithacius, who was subsequently deposed from his see by a synod of Hispanic bishops, and his friend and abettor Hydatius, was compelled to resign.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Grant was {{assigned}} to several different posts over the ensuing six years. His first post war assignments took him and Julia to Detroit and Sackets Harbor, New York, the location that made them the happiest. In the spring of 1852, he traveled in to Washington, D.C. in a failed attempt to prevail upon the Congress <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> <b>an</b> <b>order</b> that he, {{in his capacity as}} quartermaster, reimburse the military $1000 in losses incurred on his watch, for which he bore no personal guilt. He was sent west to Fort Vancouver in the Oregon Territory in 1852, initially landing in San Francisco {{during the height of the}} California Gold Rush. Julia could not accompany him as she was eight months pregnant with their second child; further, a lieutenant's salary would not support a family on the frontier. The journey proved to be an ordeal due to transportation disruptions and an outbreak of cholera within the entourage while traveling overland through Panama. Grant made use of his organizational skills, arranging makeshift transportation and hospital facilities to take care of the sick. There were 150 4th Infantry fatalities including Grant's long-time friend John H. Gore. After Grant arrived in San Francisco he traveled to Fort Vancouver, continuing his service as quartermaster; the U.S. military was to keep the peace in the Pacific Northwest between settlers and Indians in the aftermath of the Cayuse War.|$|E

Qin was worried because after nearly two months of torture, he could not get Yue to admit to treason and would eventually have to let him go. However, after a servant girl brought fresh oranges into the room, Lady Wang devised a plan to execute Yue. She told Qin to slip an execution notice inside the skin of an orange and send it to the judge presiding over Yue's case. This way, Yue and his companions would be put to death before the emperor or Qin himself would have <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> <b>an</b> open <b>order</b> of execution. This conspiracy became known as the [...] "East Window Plot". A novel about this incident, titled Dong Chuang Ji (東窗記; [...] "Tale of the Eastern Window"), was written during the Ming dynasty by an anonymous writer.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{one source}} that called the battle a French victory, the Austrians lost 1,100 killed and wounded plus 500 {{captured}} while the French suffered 1,200 killed and wounded plus 1,200 captured. Another authority characterized the {{action as a}} [...] "drawn battle" [...] and stated that casualties numbered 3,000 on each side. The Austrian retreat was not molested by the French, {{which was one of}} the reasons why Charles fought the battle. The Austrian army crossed the Danube at Dillingen and Donauwörth, destroying all the bridges behind them. Furious with Duhesme for retreating, Moreau removed him from command of his division.

50|$|At this point, McPherson sent a note back to Grant {{stating that}} he had been engaged with a Confederate force of about 1,000 men for two hours and was about to get the upper hand. This was an {{incredibly}} accurate statement. So far, the Confederates had only managed to commit the 7th Texas and 3rd Tennessee Infantry Regiments, just under 1,000 men in total. Strangely enough, the Confederates engaged now found themselves caught in the same trap that they had planned for the Federals: they had been lured in a disorganized mass across a nearly impassable creek, and now faced the danger of being driven into the creek and slaughtered. The enfilading fire on the 3rd Tennessee began to take its toll, and the its left flank crumbled. Col. Hiram Granbury of the 7th Texas decided to <b>order</b> <b>a</b> withdrawal, then had second thoughts and sent a courier to his right battalion with <b>a</b> message <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the <b>order.</b> <b>A</b> timely bullet killed the courier before he could deliver the message, meaning that for a few valuable minutes five companies of the 7th Texas regiment were holding back an entire Federal army division. This allowed hundreds of Confederates to withdraw safely across the creek. A final push by the fresh 8th Illinois Infantry regiment finally broke the 7th Texas. A proud veteran regiment that had once boasted that it had never been broken in battle was now reduced to fleeing for its life in scattered groups, with hundreds of Federals in pursuit.|$|R
