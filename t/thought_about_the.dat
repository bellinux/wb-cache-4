5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented that the development team should have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> riot.|$|E

5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> president of his own graduating class, who was someone {{he had nothing to do}} with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E
5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E

For Unger, economic institutions have no inherent or natural forms, and he rejects the necessitarian tendencies of classical and neo-classical economists, seeking instead alternatives to the arrangements of contemporary societies. In his writings, he has aimed to revise ideas {{on the importance of}} market economies and the division of labor in the workplace and national and global economies.|$|E

25|$|We do not {{understand}} exactly how Renaissance artists <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging from {{the windows of the}} surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on.

25|$|There, he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{case of a}} uniformly {{accelerated}} box not in a gravitational field, {{and noted}} {{that it would be}} indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks {{at the top of a}} box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.|$|E

25|$|Seven people {{survived the}} impact, {{although}} they were all injured and in shock. One of the survivors assisted two others away from the wreck, which was burning, and they all rallied a distance away from the wreck. They stated to the press afterwards {{that they were all}} apathetic and in shock, and that none of them <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibilities to search for help. Also, none of them knew where they were. They heard the search being carried out by helicopter and were therefore aware that they were being searched for. Two of the initial survivors later died, bringing the death toll to forty.|$|E
25|$|EMDR {{begins by}} {{identifying}} troubling memories, cognitions and sensations {{a patient is}} struggling with. Then negative thoughts are found that the patient has associated with each memory. While both memory and thought are held in mind the patient follows a moving object with their eyes. After, a positive <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> memory is discussed in an aim to replace the association the negative thought has to the memory with a more preferable thought. Experiments have shown that targeted negative memories are recalled less vividly and with less emotion after treatments with EMDR. Skin conductance responses, a measure of stress and arousal, have also shown lower levels when negative memories treated with EMDR were brought to mind.|$|E
25|$|According {{to early}} Muslim historians, towns that {{surrendered}} without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims {{were allowed to}} retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques. One of the earliest examples {{of these kinds of}} conversions was in Damascus, Syria, where in 705 Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I bought the church of St. John from the Christians and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, When He was left in Africa, he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> laws of the world and studied them. Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (Al-Waleed's father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.|$|E

Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing.

25|$|One such {{therapy is}} trauma-focused therapy. This therapy {{involves}} bringing {{the most disturbing}} elements of a traumatic memory to mind and using therapist-guided cognitive restructuring {{to change the way}} the memories are <b>thought</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> change in evaluation usually involves highlighting that the feelings of certain death, extreme danger, hopelessness and helplessness within a traumatic memory do not apply to the person now, as they survived the event. The therapy also focuses on extending the memory so it is recalled beyond the most traumatic parts. Extending them to a point where the person felt safe again, so they remember the event in a more complete way with less focus on the negative aspects. As an example, a traumatic memory of wartime combat might be extended to after a battle, to when the person was no longer in immediate danger. In processing the memory in these ways it becomes less likely to intrude into their thoughts as an unwanted flashback.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern widely {{accepted}} theory of planetary formation—the Solar Nebular Disk Model (SNDM)—can {{be traced to the}} works of Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His book Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets, which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> formation of the planets. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill, who discovered runaway accretion. By the early 1980s, the nebular hypothesis in the form of SNDM had come back into favour, led by two major discoveries in astronomy. First, a number of apparently young stars, such as Beta Pictoris, were found to be surrounded by discs of cool dust, much as was predicted by the nebular hypothesis. Second, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, launched in 1983, observed that many stars had an excess of infrared radiation that could be explained if they were orbited by discs of cooler material.|$|E
