25|$|In the Chinese <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time reincarnation {{was only}} {{possible}} {{if there was}} a soul or essence to reincarnate. Early Chinese Buddhism therefore assumed that this was also the teaching of the Buddha. In the 6th century CE it dawned that anatman and sunyata are central Buddhist teachings, which make the postulation of an eternal self problematic.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags {{adjoining}} {{it helped}} form {{the ideas of}} modern geology as it is currently understood. It was in these areas that James Hutton observed that the deposition of the sedimentary and formation of the igneous rocks must have occurred at different ages and in different ways than the <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time said they did. It is possible to see a particular area known as Hutton’s Section in the Salisbury Crags where the magma forced {{its way through the}} sedimentary rocks above it to form the dolerite sills that {{can be seen in the}} Section.|$|E
25|$|An {{intuitive}} {{interpretation of}} the Cartan connection in this form is that it determines a fracturing of the tautological principal bundle associated to a Klein geometry. Thus Cartan geometries are deformed analogues of Klein geometries. This deformation is roughly a prescription for attaching {{a copy of the}} model space G/H to each point of M and <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> model space as being tangent to (and infinitesimally identical with) the manifold at a point of contact. The fibre of the tautological bundle G → G/H of the Klein geometry at the point of contact is then identified with the fibre of the bundle P. Each such fibre (in G) carries a Maurer-Cartan form for G, and the Cartan connection is a way of assembling these Maurer-Cartan forms gathered from the points of contact into a coherent 1-form η defined on the whole bundle. The fact that only elements of H contribute to the Maurer-Cartan equation Ad(h)R'h*η = η has the intuitive interpretation that any other elements of G would move the model space away from the point of contact, and so no longer be tangent to the manifold.|$|E

500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if we can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E
2500|$|When an {{interviewer}} said that saving Cedric's body resembled {{the actions of}} Hector, Achilles, and Patroclus in the Iliad, Rowling said, [...] "That's where it came from. That really, really, really moved me when I read that when I was 19. The idea of the desecration of a body, a very ancient idea... I was <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> when Harry saved Cedric's body." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 1st century, traditions flourished that {{represented}} the <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time, and also preserved source material {{for many of}} the ideas in the [...] "theological writings of the church fathers." [...] In their present form the pseudepigraphal writings contained in the Sibylline Oracles include literature written from the 2nd century BC through the 6th century of the Christian era. They contain some material relevant to the birth and infancy of Jesus. But this passage in the Oracles, Book III, probably represents the hopes of pre-Christian Alexandrian Jews.|$|E
