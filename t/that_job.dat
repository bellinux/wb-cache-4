5|$|Dion {{was born}} on August 11, 1918 in Saint-Rémi-de-Tingwick, Quebec and had twelve siblings: six {{brothers}} and six sisters. He got his start as an ice hockey goaltender with the Junior Verdun Maple Leafs of the Quebec Junior Hockey League in 1937 and was selected {{as one of the}} goaltenders for the 1938 Memorial Cup All-Star team. He also played one game with the senior Maple Leafs that season. He served briefly in the Canadian Army in Cornwall, Ontario and also worked as an asbestos miner for Johns Manville prior to quitting <b>that</b> <b>job</b> to play professional hockey.|$|E
5|$|In October 1931 Prime Minister Niceto Alcalá Zamora {{resigned}} and was succeeded by Manuel Azaña. Radical Party leader Alejandro Lerroux had wanted <b>that</b> <b>job</b> himself and became alienated, switching his party's {{support to the}} opposition. This left Azaña dependent on the Socialists, but both the Socialists, who favoured reform, and the conservative right, who were against reform, were critical of the government. Socialists continued to support Azaña, but the left became fractured, driving the Socialists to the left, while the right united into CEDA, which tacitly embraced fascism.|$|E

Bidding on the subcontracting jobs opened at the end of March, and the contracts were announced on June 12, 1974.|$|E

5|$|Under {{financial}} pressure, Goldkette {{folded his}} premier band in September in New York. Paul Whiteman hoped to snatch up Goldkette's best musicians for his traveling orchestra, but Beiderbecke, Trumbauer, Murray, Bill Rank, Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, Chauncey Morehouse, and Frank Signorelli instead joined the bass saxophone player Adrian Rollini at the Club New Yorker. When <b>that</b> <b>job</b> ended sooner than expected, in October 1927, Beiderbecke and Trumbauer {{signed on with}} Whiteman. They joined his orchestra in Indianapolis on October 27.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Shelley {{worked in}} Seremban in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, until May 1965. He then {{returned}} to Singapore and began working for a company manufacturing pipes, subsequently starting his own machinery-importing business. He also served on the Public Service Commission (PSC) for over three decades, from 1976 to 2007. The PSC is a body created by the Constitution of Singapore that appoints, promotes, dismisses and exercises disciplinary control over public officers in Singapore. It has additional responsibility for planning and administering scholarships provided by the Government of Singapore. Shelley was involved in interviewing civil servants as well as students seeking scholarships; {{he wrote a book}} entitled How to Interview Well and Get <b>that</b> <b>Job!</b> (2004). For service to the people of Singapore, the Government conferred the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) on him in 1978, awarding an additional Bar the following year.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Christie {{attempted}} to get command {{of operations for}} Atlantic submarines, but <b>that</b> <b>job</b> went to James Fife instead. However, Christie was given command of naval forces in the Philippines. He retired from the Navy on 1 August 1949, with tombstone promotion {{to the rank of}} vice admiral. He sold life insurance and dabbled in other ventures for some time. In his final years, he lived on the west coast of the United States and in Hawaii. Christie died in Honolulu, Hawaii on 19 December 1987 at the age of 94. His wife, LaRene, joined him at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific following her death on 31 May 2002. His papers are in the Library of Congress.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} {{to work with the}} idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed <b>that</b> <b>job</b> creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when <b>that</b> <b>job</b> was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E
5|$|Atrash {{supported}} {{formation of}} the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union between Syria and Egypt, in 1958. During the UAR years, Atrash became a devoted Nasserite—a supporter of President Gamal Abdel Nasser's policies—and wrote several articles in Nasserite daily newspaper Al Jamahir ("The People.") Atrash opposed the break-up of the union after a secessionist coup in September 1961, and opposed playing a political role in the anti-unionist governments that succeeded the UAR; Prime Minister Bashir al-Azma (term in 1962) offered him a cabinet post, but he turned down the offer, citing his ideological opposition to a secessionist government. Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm (term in 1962–63) appointed him minister of social affairs without asking him, but Atrash turned down <b>that</b> <b>job</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev {{moved to}} the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita {{followed}} later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, {{was at the heart}} of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost <b>that</b> <b>job</b> when he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields Massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of Pravda. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid hoped {{his next}} {{assignment}} {{would be that}} of naval attaché to London, but <b>that</b> <b>job</b> went to Captain Alan G. Kirk. Kinkaid was offered and accepted the post in Rome instead. He took up his posting there in November 1938. In 1939, he was also accredited with the American embassy in Belgrade. Kinkaid reported that Italy was unprepared for war. Only in May 1940 did he warn that Italy was mobilizing. Soon after, he learned from Count Galeazzo Ciano that Italy would declare war on France and Britain between 10 and 15 June 1940. He provided accurate reports on the damage inflicted by the British in the Battle of Taranto. He returned to the U.S. in March 1941.|$|E
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} in {{use by the}} Erie until October 1960, when that was folded into the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, which itself would fold in April 1976, as it was absorbed into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Conrail maintained passenger services until 1983, when <b>that</b> <b>job</b> {{was taken over by}} Metro-North Railroad. On April 18, 1983, the last passenger train left the Harriman station, as Conrail and Metro-North abandoned the tracks in favor of using the Graham Line (a high-speed freight line) for passenger and freight service. At that time, a new park & ride off of New York State Route 17 in Harriman opened for the newly realigned passenger service along the ex-Graham Line.|$|E

5|$|Under Mohammad Daoud Khan's prime ministership, {{suppression}} of radicals was common. However, {{because of his}} language skills, Taraki {{was sent to the}} Afghan Embassy in the United States in 1952. Within several months Taraki began denouncing the Afghan government under King Zahir Shah and accused it of being autocratic and dictatorial. His denunciation of the Afghan government earned him much publicity in the United States. It also attracted unfavorable attention from authorities back home, who relieved him of his post and ordered him repatriated but stopped short of placing him under arrest. After a short period of unemployment Taraki started working for the United States Overseas Mission in Kabul as an interpreter. He quit <b>that</b> <b>job</b> in 1958 and established his own translation company, the Noor Translation Bureau. Four years later, he started working for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, but quit in 1963 to focus on the establishment of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a communist political party.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost <b>that</b> <b>job</b> during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister's boyfriend encouraged him {{to apply for a}} job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.|$|E
5|$|Docherty {{found work}} as a {{domestic}} servant {{at the age of}} 14, before moving on to working in a factory. She tried to find a job after returning from Russia, but her travel there meant that people were unwilling to employ her. Thus she sold firewood along with her father for a while. She eventually found work at the Leith Hospital as a cleaner, because <b>that</b> <b>job</b> did not require references. She then worked as a servant for five years, before leaving to attend to her mother, who was ill. Back in Fife, she worked as an assistant to a dentist. She stated later in life that when she attended rallies with the communist party, she had to lie to her employers about where she went. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she began working in the Crombie munitions factory, before shifting to looking after children in Rosyth. The final job she held was at a cooperative bakery. She continued her work for the Communist Party while holding all of these positions.|$|E

Jobs furiously called Katzenberg to explain that {{there was nothing he could}} do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg said to him <b>that</b> <b>Jobs</b> himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining <b>that</b> <b>Jobs</b> had come to Pixar's rescue from near bankruptcy by making the deal for Toy Story with Disney. He suggested <b>that</b> <b>Jobs</b> had enough power with Disney to convince them to change specific plans on their films. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with a final proposition to delay Antz if Disney and Pixar changed the date of Bug's Life, but Katzenberg denied this later. Jobs believed it was [...] "a blatant extortion attempt".|$|R

He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. He missed part of 2003 with an injury and {{was traded to the}} Chicago White Sox following the season. After one season as a utility player, Uribe became the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005; he held that position for the next three years. While Uribe was with the White Sox, the team won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. Uribe hit 21 home runs in 2006 but had a low on-base percentage. He hit 20 home runs in 2007 but had a low batting average {{with runners in scoring position}} (RISP). In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second, but then lost <b>that</b> <b>job</b> to rookie Alexei Ramírez.
