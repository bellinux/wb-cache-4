500|$|The {{director}} Sanjay Gupta cast Ranaut {{in a brief}} role opposite John Abraham in {{the crime}} thriller Shootout at Wadala (2013) due to her ability to stand out in a predominantly male-centric film. The Daily News and Analysis Tushar Joshi wrote that her role was written [...] "to provide the sex quotient" [...] and critic Vinayak Chakravorty opined that she [...] "does not get much scope [...] beyond <b>the</b> <b>steamy</b> lovemaking grind". Commercially, the film performed moderately well.|$|E
500|$|Posters and {{publicity}} photos were often tantalizing. Women appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed {{in the films}} themselves. In some cases actresses with small parts in films (or {{in the case of}} Dolores Murray in her publicity still for The Common Law, no part at all) appeared scantily clad. Hays became outraged at <b>the</b> <b>steamy</b> pictures circulating in newspapers around the country. The original Hays Code contained an often-ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new advertising screed {{in the style of the}} Ten Commandments that contained a set of twelve prohibitions. The first seven addressed imagery. They prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material. The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, [...] "salacious copy", and the word [...] "courtesan".|$|E
500|$|Thomas Conner {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times neither praised nor criticized the song, but instead focused on <b>the</b> <b>steamy</b> {{nature of the}} composition. [...] " [...] and panting duet partner Drake steam the {{recording}} studio windows as he raps a helpless play-by-play". Bill Lamb from About.com gave the song a positive review, saying that [...] "There it is, the chorus opens the track with [...] "Oh na na...what's my name?" [...] and the hook is firmly implanted. It's not long before Drake's added on rap kicks in with clever, sexy and romantic rhyming. Then the dreamy drum machine rhythms and Rihanna's vocals kick in again. This is a hit... "What's My Name?" [...] is a good addition to that romantic evening playlist." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the [...] "song's chorus" [...] and [...] "Drake's verse". Molly Lambert of Pitchfork Media praised Rihanna's performance saying that [...] "On 'What's My Name', Rihanna doesn't have {{to tell us how}} desirable she is – it is a given. There is never any doubt in her delivery that Rihanna really might as well be the only girl in the world".|$|E

500|$|Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave an {{unfavorable}} review. Although sex in popular music {{is considered a}} standard concept, Willman states the only reason the album would cause a reaction is because of Jackson's well-known conservative nature. He comments: [...] "So be it. Jackson's first album in four years is destined for a long ride at No. 1, not because it's any great piece of work, but largely for its aphrodisiacal aspirations." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "f musical variety and daring lyrics were all that mattered, Janet would make the grade. But the album {{has a lot to}} prove. It is the first delivery under her $40 million contract with Virgin, and its title—which translates as 'Janet, period'—is meant as a declaration of independence from her oddball siblings... She still sounds like a young woman from a male-dominated family who is searching for her identity and voice. Mostly, though, Janet sounds like a mess—period." [...] David Sinclair of The Times wrote: [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>steamy,</b> post-Madonna climate of the 1990s, Jackson is not about to let thoughts of love {{get in the way of}} the mechanics of lust, and like many of her superstar contemporaries she tends to confuse sex with soul." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{reviewing}} the film at AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna regards {{this as a}} misleading classification, as does Leo Goldsmith, writing at notcoming.com, and the review on Blu-ray.com. Writing in TV Guide, Maitland McDonagh writes [...] "No one familiar with the cold precision of Kubrick's work will be surprised that this isn't <b>the</b> <b>steamy</b> erotic thriller a synopsis (or the ads) might suggest." [...] Writing in general about the genre of 'erotic thriller' for CineAction in 2001, Douglas Keesey states that [...] "whatever [...] actual type, [...] was at least marketed as an erotic thriller". Michael Koresky, writing in the 2006 issue of film journal Reverse Shot, writes [...] "this director, who defies expectations at every turn and brings genre to his feet, was... setting out to make neither the 'erotic thriller' that the press maintained nor an easily identifiable 'Kubrick film'". DVD Talk similarly dissociates the film from this genre.|$|E

The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, [...] "salacious copy", and the word [...] "courtesan". Soon, studios found their way around the restrictions and published more racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside Cardinal Thomas Dougherty's home. Severely offended, Dougherty helped launch the motion picture boycott that later facilitated the enforcement of the code. A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the code itself, was the notion that film was a medium that greatly appealed to the masses and thus needed to be regulated.|$|E

[...] Love also co-wrote and co-produced another R midtempo for the album titled [...] "Feeling Me Right Now", where the lyrics describe {{what it is like}} to find [...] "self-love" [...] in the club. The final Love-penned song which appears on the album is titled [...] "Each Other" [...] and was co-written/co-produced by Souldiggaz. Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins scores two songs on the album, including the Lil Playy-assisted [...] "Work It Man". Beginning with a strong piano riff, the song picks up its tempo resulting in a [...] "speaker-banger." [...] The lyrics see Rowland telling listeners what kind of man she wants. [...] "Turn It Up", another Darkchild production, features a synth-heavy production with lyrics about having a good time and allowing karma to deal with a cheating partner. Joseph [...] "Lonny" [...] Bereal helped Rowland and two others to co-write [...] "Keep It Between Us", a song that appears as the eighth song on the album. In February 2011, during New York Fashion Week, Rowland confirmed that she also had sessions arranged with RedOne, which led to the conception of the album's tenth song, a Eurodance song called [...] "Down for Whatever", co-produced by The WAV.s and Jimmy Joker.|$|E

500|$|A {{scene in}} which Ivan and Paul shared a kiss on a sofa sparked some {{controversy}} with viewers. 126 people complained to media watch dog Ofcom deeming the scenes to be explicit.

[...] Jody Rosen of The New York Times opined that the video featured mostly slow-motion pictures of [...] "billowing silk sheets and water droplets tumbling onto Beyoncé's bare midriff".

2500|$|Several album tracks gained notoriety {{within the}} {{entertainment}} industry, in particular [...] "Would You Mind" [...] {{due to its}} racy composition and explicit sexual content.

She ends the song by requesting that he come inside of her and let his juices flow deep in her passion." [...] Its shock value was considered [...] "enough to make Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] sound like Christian rock." [...] Its explicit lyrics caused the album to be banned in several conservative countries such as Singapore. The song was used in films such as stoner comedy How High. Its [...] "gravity defying and mouth watering" [...] live rendition was regarded among the most controversial performances of her career. In 2012, it was ranked <b>the</b> <b>steamiest</b> song of her discography; an anecdote saying, [...] "This song is so racy people {{use it as a}} euphemism when talking about what they did the night before when children are present."
