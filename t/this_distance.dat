At <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> from the star, tidal {{interactions}} should in theory circularize the orbit; however, measurements reveal {{that it has a}} high eccentricity of 0.207, comparable to that of Mercury in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In astronomical terms, the Gliese 581 {{system is}} {{relatively}} close to Earth, at 20.37 light-years (192 trillion km or 119 trillion miles) {{in the direction}} of the constellation of Libra. <b>This</b> <b>distance,</b> along with the declination and right ascension coordinates, give its exact location in our galaxy.|$|E
5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at <b>this</b> <b>distance.</b> Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>distance,</b> {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E

5|$|Hampden is an all-seated bowl stadium, {{although}} {{the ground is}} split into four geographic sections, officially known as the North, East, South and West Stands. Due to {{the dominance of the}} Old Firm within Scottish football and their regular qualification for cup matches played at Hampden, the East and West stands are commonly known as the Celtic and Rangers ends. The East Stand has 12,800 seats on a single tier of 53 rows. The two end stands are up to 140metres away from the pitch, due to Hampden retaining its bowl shape after it was redeveloped. <b>This</b> <b>distance</b> is almost as great as if Hampden included an athletics track, {{although the}} distance between the pitch and the two side stands is more comparable to a normal football stadium.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. <b>This</b> <b>distance</b> compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity was assumed to be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet is assumed to be 1650 K, far hotter than Jupiter's, which is assumed to be 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E

5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} and {{effective}} colours are red, yellow, black and white. These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, have strong contrast, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning colouration provide <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and colour combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning colouration evolves in response to background, light conditions, and predator vision. Visible signals may be accompanied by odours, sounds or behaviour to provide a multi-modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators.|$|E
5|$|The two Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{made the}} first close-up images of Enceladus. Voyager 1 {{was the first to}} fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000km on November 12, 1980. Images acquired from <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, Voyager scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus's surface.|$|E

5|$|The {{two general}} routes {{followed}} by the Butterfield Overland Stage and the Southern Pacific Railroad—known respectively as the Tejon Pass Route and the Tehachapi or Midway Route – were the main automobile routes between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley around {{the start of the}} 20th century. The State Bureau of Highways recommended in 1895 that a more direct route be built to shorten <b>this</b> <b>distance.</b> A bond issue was approved in 1909 and 1910 to build a state highway system, including the Ridge Route. The new California Highway Commission was unable to raise funds in the East, but Los Angeles again contributed funds to ensure that construction would go forward.|$|E
5|$|This {{planning}} depth is {{also seen}} {{in the presence of}} exotic raw materials at a variety of sites throughout the MSA. Procurement of local raw materials would have been a simple task to accomplish, yet MSA sites regularly contain raw materials that were obtained from sources over 100 km away, and sometimes farther than 300 km. Obtaining raw materials from <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> would require an awareness of the resources, a perceived value in the resources, whether it be functional or symbolic, and, possibly, the ability to organize an exchange network in order to obtain the materials.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of the delay, Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape. Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape, the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> should have taken has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay, at least partially, to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|At the {{subsolar point}} the bow shock stands 1900km (0.3 Rv, where Rv is the radius of Venus) {{above the surface}} of Venus. <b>This</b> <b>distance</b> was {{measured}} in 2007 near the solar activity minimum.

The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100eV and 1000eV respectively.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E
