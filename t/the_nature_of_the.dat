40|$|A {{classification}} of echo type signals is proposed. It is shown that to classify an echo one must know the following : <b>the</b> physical <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particles or the objects that possess phase memory and generate the echo signal, <b>the</b> physical <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exciting pulses and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> response signal, <b>the</b> mobility aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particles that generate the echo {{and the real}} correspondence between <b>the</b> physical <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> echo signal and the signal in a receiver.

5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, {{the parameters of the}} ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that makes up the terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior. Further observations are necessary to confirm <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E

5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas on <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping {{the positions of the}} stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed {{to be the center of}} the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
