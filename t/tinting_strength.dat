The most common use (70%) of carbon black is as a pigment and reinforcing phase in automobile tires. Carbon black also helps conduct heat away from the tread and belt area of the tire, reducing thermal damage and increasing tire life. Carbon black particles are also employed in some radar absorbent materials used in the reduction of the radar cross-section of aircraft and in photocopier and laser printer toner, and other inks and paints. The high <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> and stability of carbon black has also provided use in coloring of resins and films. About 20% of world production goes into belts, hoses, and other non-tire rubber goods. The balance is mainly used as a pigment in inks, coatings and plastics.

30|$|Access to the {{production}} records from W&N’s 19 th century archive database {{made it possible to}} carry out a comprehensive study of their manufacturing processes for yellow chromate pigments based on barium (BaCrO 4), zinc (4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O) and strontium (SrCrO 4). One hundred and three production records were found for the manufacture of Lemon Yellow (barium chromate, 69 %), Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate, 25 %) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate, 6 %). The majority covers the period between 1838 and 1871. Analysis of W&N’s production records indicates that one main synthetic pathway was found for each pigment. The pH was a key factor controlled by W&N to achieve precipitation of zinc potassium and strontium chromate pigments. There was no evidence that extenders were added during the synthesis of these pigments, whereas their production records for lead chromates do show the addition of extenders [25]. The lack of extenders for these pigments may infer that for W&N, extenders were primarily present to adjust physical properties, <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> or hue, rather than functioning predominantly as a means to reduce the cost of materials. The relative <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> (TS) of these pigments is lower than pure lead chromate pigments. It was calculated in comparison to pure lead chromate (PbCrO 4,) which was assigned a TS of 100 %. This resulted in a TS of 92 % for barium, 78 % for strontium and 65 % for zinc potassium chromate pigments.|$|E

Black earth from Vicoforte (Piedmont) exhibits good properties which are improved particularly when mixed with oil and egg.

30|$|Overall, {{however, the}} most {{dramatic}} impact of these first changes was less in the color qualities of the new imported colorants but rather in the quantity with which they could be used, because of high <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> relative to cost, and an ease of printing that probably reduced labor costs. This was true above all of the advantage that carmine had over safflower, resulting in an immediate and sharp increase in the sheer area over which cochineal red was applied from 1869 on, most conspicuously in solid red backgrounds (cf. Figs.  1 and 7), or in wide bands of red gradation down from the upper edge or up from the horizon.

40|$|Carbon {{black and}} iron black (FeaO 4) are black {{pigments}} {{commonly used in}} the cosmetic industry.

Traditionally, the identification of dyes has required relatively large samples (0. 5 - 5 mm in diameter) for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatogra-phy.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the {{possibilities}} of colouring concrete {{and the use of}} pigments are presented. There are two groups of pigments with respect to its manufacture (organic and inorganic) and three different forms available on market: powder, granulates and slurry. Next to the influences of other concrete components the effects of fine pigment particles on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete are introduced. Because of the higher need of water the workability of each mixture is affected. With the increasing specific surface area of pigment the flow of fresh concrete decreases. On the other hand this characteristic feature causes slightly higher density of concrete matrix which results in better durability. Optimal dosages differs depending on the form of pigment, for powders it is about 5 % of the weight of cement content. Higher amounts don´t bring about higher <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> {{and in the case of}} more than 10 % its mechanical properties can be negatively affected. An example of colour evaluation as well as utilization of recycled materials as colouring agents are also mentioned...|$|E
30|$|It {{seems that}} the final colour is {{strongly}} dependent on these parameters. Regarding grain size, the best results were obtained when the finest fraction extracted with dry and wet methods was used; in fact <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> of carbon-based pigments is dependent on particle size [1]. Naturally, the product available on the market gave very good results because its grain size and homogeneity have been carefully controlled industrially. Another important factor is the partial instability of the raw materials in air and sunlight as reported in Table  4. This behaviour was also noted in the case of charcoal black as carbon-based pigments produced by combustion may contain tarry material which can bleeds [2]. Finally, the collected black earths turned grey or faded when mixed with alkaline media such as lime and caseinates; this behaviour was not observed with commercially available black earths with similar mineralogical and chemical composition. On the other hand, good permanence was observed {{in the case of a}} fresco painting technique. An adequate discussion on this issue would require an in-depth analysis of the composition of the C-based fraction and of possible impurities which seem to have an active role in the stability of some black pigments with alkaline media [1].|$|E
30|$|The pigment Prussian blue (PB) was {{synthesized}} accidentally in 1704 by the colormaker Diesbach [1]. Because of {{its high}} <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> and availability (it could be easily synthesized by the artists), the pigment soon became popular: It was used as early as 1710 by painters and was later employed in the first photographic printing processes as a dye, and {{for a wide range}} of manufactured objects (e.g. textiles, blueprints, stamps, etc.). Since its first use, the permanence of Prussian blue has been questioned, especially when mixed with other paints in oil paintings or when submitted to light and low-oxygen treatments [2]-[4]. In her reference work on the history of artist’s pigments [1], Berrie describes Prussian blue as “both permanent and impermanent“. Indeed, those fading processes depend a lot on the object investigated [2],[5],[6]. Moreover, the faded pigment might partially recolor when stored in the dark under oxygen [7],[8], puzzling conservators concerned with the preservation of Prussian blue objects and preventing them from choosing adequate conservation solutions. Can artifacts containing Prussian blue be exposed to light or preserved in an anoxic frame? Are fading-recoloration cycles safe for the objects? Are cleaning treatments for PB artifacts suitable or do they enhance the light-sensitivity of Prussian blue? Can we predict the permanence of Prussian blue in objects and based on which criteria? All these practical questions require a deep understanding of the physico-chemical process(es) responsible for PB fading.|$|E
30|$|Although MA-XRF {{scanning}} is not depth-selective, {{it appeared}} to be highly suitable to study the complex layer sequencing that is typical for seventeenth century still life paintings. The ground rule was to start off with an underpainting, blocking out each figure in its own basic color, using pigments with strong hiding power and/or <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> and then gradually building up the tonality and form by applying local passages of transparent pigments in the upper paint layers. This particular system, in fact, favored characterizing the build-up of the paint layers with MA-XRF scanning. Pigments with more body, such as vermilion (HgS), lead white (PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) and umber (Fe 2 O 3 ·(H 2 O) + MnO 2) were often found in the ground, underpainting, or as small highlights in the upper layers. Those pigments are composed of elements with a high atomic number, and are consequently easier to detect with MA-XRF scanning and less influenced by attenuation. In addition, the superimposed layers are projected as a shadow on top of the fluorescence emission from subjacent layers. Therefore, the degree of attenuation and blocked fluorescence emission of the elements gave an insight in the layered sequence. In return, pigments with a smaller body and little hiding power, such as ultramarine and lakes, are composed of elements with a low atomic number and are highly influenced by attenuation and blocking by other elements. Since they are usually found in upper layers of the strata, the fluorescence emission of the elements is either not or to a lesser degree attenuated. Moreover, color information from the paint surface can ameliorate the ability to distinguish pigments with the same element composition.|$|E
3000|$|This work {{focuses on}} the study of the 19 th century yellow {{chromate}} pigments based on barium (BaCrO 4), zinc (4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O) and strontium (SrCrO 4). These pigments, which are reported to shift in hue and darken, have been found in 19 th century artworks. A better understanding of their historic manufacture will contribute to the visual/chemical interpretation of change in these colours. Research was carried out on the Winsor & Newton (W&N) 19 th century archive database providing a unique insight into their manufacturing processes. One hundred and three production records were found, 69 % for barium, 25 % for zinc and 6 % for strontium chromates, mainly under the names Lemon, Citron and Strontian Yellow, respectively. Analysis of the records shows that each pigment is characterised by only one synthetic pathway. The low number of records found for the production of strontium chromate suggests W&N was not selling this pigment formulation on a large scale. Furthermore, contrary to what the authors have discovered for W&N chrome yellow pigments, extenders were not added to these pigment formulations, most probably due to their lower <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> (TS). The latter was calculated in comparison to pure chrome yellow (PbCrO 4, 100 % TS) resulting in 92 % for barium, 65 % for zinc potassium and 78 % for strontium chromate pigments. This indicates that W&N was probably using extenders primarily to adjust pigment properties and not necessarily as a means to reduce their costs.

30|$|The {{identification}} of a naturally occurring white pigment based on cristobalite and anatase is noteworthy. While {{there have been other}} claims of original titanium dioxide-bearing white pigments on ancient objects, these claims have often been based on Raman analysis alone and have subsequently been argued to suffer from the disproportionate response of this method to the typical small amounts of rutile and anatase in what are likely to have been clay-based materials [40 – 43]. In the present case, however, the Raman results corroborate the findings of the other analytical techniques, providing evidence of the use of cristobalite containing a significant, if lesser, amount of natural anatase, possibly from an ore body such as the “Giacomo Deposit”. Indeed, the strong light scattering properties, and hence remarkable <b>tinting</b> <b>strength,</b> of titanium dioxide pigments would allow practical use of a source material such as the “Giacomo Deposit” ore with what the XRD results suggest is a lower proportion of anatase relative to cristobalite [44]. Furthermore, extensive examination of the qeros decorated with pigmented inlay confers a high level of confidence in the originality of these occurrences. It has often been suggested that anatase would not be expected to be found in artwork created before 1920, as the pigment was first synthesized and produced on a commercial scale in 1916 – 1918 [45]. On this basis, the presence of synthetic anatase in a work claiming pre-twentieth century origin has sometimes been interpreted as an indication of forgery, the most extensive discussion of which having been {{in the context of the}} Vinland Map [46 – 48]. However, based on the context of occurrence, the anatase found on the qeros in this study appears to be of natural origin and original to the vessels.|$|E

These pigments are of great relevance in artwork and textile, plastic, and photochemical industries due to their condition as high performance pigments since they possess a high <b>tinting</b> <b>strength.</b> Due to this fact, they have been employed at relatively low concentrations. Therefore, the analysis and detection of these pigments requires the application of a highly sensitivity technique, such as SERS and SEF. The adsorption of QA and 2, 9 -DMQA on silver nanoparticles was extensively studied by means of SERS at different surface coverages. This study was completed by carrying out an in depth vibrational (Raman and IR) analysis of these pigments in solid state by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, UV-vis spectroscopy was employed to investigate the aggregation undergone by both pigments in solid state and in solution. 2, 9 -DMQA was demonstrated to have a lower tendency toward aggregation due to the presence of methyl groups. Even so, this molecule follows a BET adsorption mechanism on the metal nanoparticles due to its high tendency toward intermolecular interaction. From the analysis of the adsorption mechanism of this molecule, the limit of detection was deduced to be ca. 55 ppb. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Prussian blue pigments, highly {{insoluble}} mixed-valence iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) complexes {{of typical}} stoichiometry Fe 4 III[FeII(CN) 6] 3 ·xH 2 O or KFeIII[FeII(CN) 6]·xH 2 O, {{have been used}} as pigments in oil paintings and watercolors for 300 years. For poorly understood reasons, these pigments often fade with time. Although the preparation methods have been recognized since the mid-eighteenth century as a contributory factor in the fading of the pigment, the spectral and physical properties of Prussian blue that vary with the type of synthesis were not precisely identified. Several Prussian blue pigments have been prepared by different methods and characterized by thermogravimetric analyses, high-energy powder X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption and flame emission, UV–visible, iron- 57 Mössbauer, iron K-edge X-ray absorption, and Raman spectroscopy. The type of synthesis influences the hue, <b>tinting</b> <b>strength,</b> and hiding power properties of the Prussian blue pigments. Two major features appear to be strongly dependent on the preparative methods, the particle size and the local disorder. Both a nitrogen atmosphere and an intermediate aging step of the Berlin white, Fe 2 II[FeII(CN) 6], during the synthesis are required to obtain a highly colored pigment through the optimization of particle size, minimization in the perturbations to the FeII–CN–FeIII intervalence electron transfer pathway, and the minimization of disordered vacancies. The potassium containing Prussian blue structure has been revisited. It can be described with the Pm 3 m space group, where approximately one-quarter of the [FeII(CN) 6] 4 – sites are vacant and where the potassium cation is located at a zeolitic-like position inside the lattice cavities. The degree of ordering of the [FeII(CN) 6] 4 – vacancies in all Prussian blues was quantified using atomic pair distribution analysis, an ordering that is consistent with the iron K-edge X-ray absorption spectra. The presence of strain in the crystals is observed by both powder X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The structural similarity between the alkali-free, improperly referred to as “insoluble”, and the alkali containing, “soluble”, Prussian blues may explain why the two varieties are almost undistinguishable by spectroscopic techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT THE EFFECTS OF COLOR CONCENTRATES ON THE RHEOLOGY OF TINT BASES Douglas James Herrick Waterborne {{coatings}} are formulated with {{a number}} of different ingredients; water, latex polymers, pigments, surfactants, dispersants, defoamers, biocides, coalescing aids, and rheology modifiers or thickeners. Rheology modifiers are necessary in order to improve the physical properties of the coating before, during, and after application to a substrate. There are two kinds of rheology modifiers used in waterborne coatings; associative thickeners and non-associative thickeners. Coatings formulated with associative thickeners are quite sensitive to coating variations; the slightest change in the formulation has profound effects on the rheology of the coating. The opposite is true for coatings formulated with non-associative thickeners, where the rheology of the coating is not affected by minor changes in the formulation. The rheological properties of coatings are most influenced by the latex, thickener, and surfactant components of the coating. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} most ideal balance of rheological properties come from using associative thickeners. However, when waterborne coatings with associative thickeners are tinted with colorants containing high levels of surfactants they exhibit a significant decrease in viscosity. This change in viscosity results in poor sag resistance, poor brush loading, and may also cause a reduction in tint strength of the coating. In this work, the effect of tinting paints with six different colorants on the viscosity of the paint was studied for four different paint formulations: a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC-type) non-associative thickeners, and a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with hydrophobically-modified, ethoxylated polyurethane (HEUR-type) associative thickeners. Gloss values and tinting strengths were obtained in accordance with ASTM methods D 523 - 08 and D 4838 - 88. In addition, dynamic stress and frequency sweeps were taken in order to study the effect of colorant addition on the viscoelastic properties of each sample. Colorant addition had little to no effects on the viscosity of the bases formulated with HEC thickeners, while there was a dramatic decrease in viscosity upon colorant addition to the bases with HEUR thickeners. Similar results were observed in the viscoelastic property analysis: little to no effects on the elastic and viscous moduli was seen with the tinted coatings formulated with the non-associative thickeners, while both the elastic and viscous moduli decreased for the coatings formulated with associative thickeners. A few of the deeptone bases showed increased moduli upon tinting compared to the parent deeptone base. The addition of colorant resulted in a decrease in <b>tinting</b> <b>strength</b> and an increase in gloss for those samples with associative thickeners, while the opposite was found for those samples with non-associative thickeners...|$|E

Commonly, titania is recovered either by leaching ilmenite with sulphuric acid and subsequently hydrolysing the resulting sulfate solution by boiling. In another process, titanium feedstock is converted into titanium tetrachloride and further oxidised to titanium dioxide. These methods are reportedly time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly. They are also unable to use all existing types of titanium minerals. In this study, a novel process for the extraction of titanium valuables from its minerals is presented. The process entails the roasting of titanium ore with alkaline metal salt. The roasted product is hydrolysed with water and acid, and subsequently reacted with sulphuric acid. Alternatively, the hydrolysed product {{can be used as}} feedstock in the chloride process. Roasting at 900 °C and using a 2 : 1 (NaOH:ilmenite) mole ratio proved to be the most efficient in releasing titanium units from its ore. Ternary phases dominate under these conditions. Na 0. 75 Fe 0. 75 Ti 0. 25 O 2 was the dominant titanium-bearing phase. NaFeTiO 4 a ndNa 2 Fe 2 Ti 3 O 10 were also present. Whenever the Ti:Fe atom ratio was different from one, the surplus titanium was accommodated in single titanates, mainly Na 2 TiO 3, while iron was accommodated in NaFeO 2. In many cases Na 8 Ti 5 O 14 was also present as a result of Na 2 TiO 3 polymerisation. This is consistent with a fusion period of one hour or more. Shorter fusion periods tended to produce binary phases. Similar results were obtained when lower fusion temperatures were employed, i. e. below 550 °C. When anatase reactant was used to resemble an anatase ore, Na 2 Ti 6 O 3,Na 2 TiO 3, Na 8 Ti 5 O 14 and Na 16 Ti 10 O 28 were identified in the products. Optimum recoveries were obtained using a 1 : 1 NaOH:TiO 2 mole ratio, and fusing at 800 °C for 2 h. Close to 100 % of the titanium was recovered. A one-step leaching process was found to be effective compared with multi-step leaching. The leaching step was found to be dependent on time, solid:liquid ratio and temperature. The optimum conditions for solid:liquid ratio, time and temperature were found to be 0. 20, and 15 min at 75 °C, respectively. Acidic hydrolysis was controlled by the relative amount of iron and titanium in solution. It was found that less than 1 % was dissolved between 3 and 7 in pH units. Higher pH values are recommended, since less acid will be used. Any excess of sulphuric acid in the sulfation step proved to be unnecessary. No significant changes were observed in the amount of dissolved iron and titanium. Therefore the stoichiometric amount can be used in the sulfation process.
