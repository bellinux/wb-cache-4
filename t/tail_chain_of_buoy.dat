40|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> a Markov <b>chain</b> {{can be used}} {{to model}} the {{dependence}} between extreme observations. For a positive recurrent Markov <b>chain,</b> the <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> aids in describing the limit of a sequence of point processes {N_n,n≥ 1 }, consisting of normalized observations plotted against scaled time points. Under fairly general conditions on extremal behaviour, {N_n} converges to a cluster Poisson process.

40|$|Abstract. The upper {{extremes}} <b>of</b> a Markov <b>chain</b> with regulary varying stationary {{marginal distribution}} {{are known to}} exhibit under general conditions a multiplicative random walk structure called the <b>tail</b> <b>chain.</b> More generally, if the Markov chain is allowed to switch from positive to negative extremes or vice versa, the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> increment may depend on the sign <b>of</b> the <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> on the previous step. But even then, the forward and backward <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> mutually determine each other through a kind of adjoint relation. As a consequence, the finite-dimensional distributions <b>of</b> the Markov <b>chain</b> are multivariate regularly varying in a way determined by the back-and-forth <b>tail</b> <b>chain.</b> An application <b>of</b> the theory yields the asymptotic distribution {{of the past and}} the future of the solution to a stochastic difference equation conditionally on the present value being large in absolute value...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{swinging}} boat moorings on intertidal benthic assemblages {{was investigated in}} a small estuary on the south coast <b>of</b> England. Mooring <b>buoys</b> fixed near low water mark on a muddy shore were attached to 5 m <b>of</b> galvanised steel <b>chain</b> and had not been let for 12 months. Core samples for macro-invertebrates and sediments were taken {{both within and outside}} the <b>chain</b> radius <b>of</b> each <b>buoy.</b> The assemblage structure, biomass and abundance of selected bird prey species were examined at a range of scales. The study revealed variation in the impact <b>of</b> mooring <b>buoys</b> relative to control areas at two different times of sampling. Prior to the removal <b>of</b> <b>buoys,</b> the assemblage structure within areas affected by the buoys was found to be significantly different from unaffected areas. The abundance of the amphipod Corophium volutator, an important bird prey species, was significantly less in the areas affected by the buoys. In the second sampling programme (15 months after removal <b>of</b> <b>buoys),</b> the impact <b>of</b> extant <b>buoys</b> remaining in commission was not detectable. Assemblage structure in areas from which buoys had been removed was distinct from control areas which had never had <b>buoys.</b> The removal <b>of</b> mooring <b>buoys</b> clearly affected the assemblage, yet convergence with control areas, indicative of recovery, was not complete after 15 months. It is suggested that the effect <b>of</b> swinging mooring <b>chains</b> scraping over the mud surface may modify sediments favouring the greater prominence of larger particles such as gravel and shell fragments. The ecological impact of swinging moorings on estuarine benthic assemblages in designated protected areas is discussed in the context of other spatial and temporal disturbances...|$|R

50|$|Under some circumstances, R. howesii {{may become}} an {{invasive}} species. In 1991, a hundred-foot vessel was shipwrecked on Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. Thirteen years {{later it was}} observed that R. howesii had colonised the area around the wreck. Over the next few years, the population increased rapidly close to the vessel and by 2008 had reached high concentrations and a phase shift had occurred in the ecology of the reef. Around the ship, R. howesii covered the sea bed overgrowing and directly competing with the few remaining corals (mainly Montipora sp., Pocillopora sp. and Acropora sp.). Close to the wreck there were as many as 288 individuals per square metre and it extended for up to 1100 metres from the vessel.Quite why R. howesii has flourished so abundantly at this location is not fully understood, but it is possible that iron is leaching from the ship and promoting its growth. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that similar explosive growth in numbers of R. howesii has occurred around the mooring <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> three <b>buoys</b> anchored some distance from the wreck. Iron is an essential trace element for growth of algae and nitrogen fixation, and much of the Pacific Ocean is extremely low in available iron which is a limiting resource for many marine organisms. Iron may also stimulate the growth of the symbiotic zooxanthellae in the polyps.|$|R
40|$|N-acylated {{homoserine}} lactone (AHL) mediated cell-cell {{communication in}} bacteria {{is dependent on}} the recognition of the cognate signal by its receptor. This interaction allows the receptor-ligand complex to act as a transcriptional activator, controlling the expression of a range of bacterial phenotypes, including virulence factor expression and biofilm formation. One approach to determine the key features of signal- binding is to model the intermolecular interactions between the receptor and ligand using computational-based modeling software (LigandFit). In this communication, we have modeled the crystal structure of the AHL receptor protein TraR and its AHL signal N-(3 - oxooctanoyl) -homoserine lactone from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and compared it to the previously reported antagonist behaviour of a number of AHL analogues, in an attempt to determine structural constraints for ligand binding. We conclude that (i) a common conformation of the AHL in the hydrophobic and hydrophilic region exists for ligand-binding, (ii) a <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> length threshold <b>of</b> 8 carbons is most favourable for ligand-binding affinity, (iii) the positive correlation in the docking studies could be used a virtual screening tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{extremes}} of a univariate Markov chain with regulary varying stationary marginal distribution and asymptotically linear behavior {{are known to}} exhibit a multiplicative random walk structure called the <b>tail</b> <b>chain.</b> In this paper, we extend this fact to Markov chains with multivariate regularly varying marginal distribution in R^{d}. We analyze both the forward and the backward tail process and show that they mutually determine each other through a kind of adjoint relation. In a broader setting, it will be seen that even for non-Markovian underlying processes a Markovian forward <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> always implies that the backward <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> is Markovian as well. We analyze the resulting class of limiting processes in detail. Applications of the theory yield the asymptotic distribution of both {{the past and the}} future of univariate and multivariate stochastic difference equations conditioned on an extreme event...|$|R
40|$|Multivariate {{extreme value}} theory has proven useful for {{modeling}} multivariate data in {{fields such as}} finance and environmental science, where one is interested in accounting for the tendency of observations to exceed an extremely high (or low) threshold. Recent work has developed extremal models by studying the conditional distribution of a random vector, conditional {{on one of the}} components becoming extreme. This provides a way to handle situations such as asymptotic dependence, where traditional techniques may be uninformative. In this thesis, we explore the implications of the assumption that such a conditional distribution is well approximated by a limiting probability distribution when the conditioning component is extreme. We consider a version of the conditional distribution specified by a transition function. If the transition kernel <b>of</b> a Markov <b>chain</b> satisfies our assumption, then a process known as the <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> approximates the Markov chain over extreme states. We characterize the class <b>of</b> <b>chains</b> which admit such an approximation, and investigate the properties <b>of</b> the <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> in relation to the distinction between extreme and non-extreme states. We find that, in general, the <b>tail</b> <b>chain</b> approximates a portion of the original process we term the "extremal component". We further derive the limit in distribution of a point process consisting <b>of</b> normalized Markov <b>chain</b> observations, expressing the limit in terms <b>of</b> the <b>tail</b> <b>chain.</b> We also consider the case where a transition function satisfying our assumption describes the dependence structure of a random vector. We establish conditions under which a conditional extreme value model is appropriate, and derive the form of the limiting measure...|$|R

40|$|In 2002, several mooring <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> Girassol Off-loading <b>buoy</b> {{which was}} {{installed}} offshore Angola ruptured just after 8 months of service. A new failure mechanism called out-of plane bending(OPB) fatigue in mooring chain links was identified {{in addition to}} tension induced fatigue {{after a series of}} experiments. Currently, there are no models in literature which can comprehensively explain OPB mechanism in mooring chain links. Models to explain OPB mechanism are required to calculate OPB stresses in chain links for fatigue damage evaluation. These models need to be "simple" and "adequate" {{in the sense that it}} should idealize the complicated geometry <b>of</b> <b>chain</b> links while giving accurate predictions of OPB stresses when subjected to rotation and tension, at a fraction of time used by solid finite element models or full scale experiments. The research carried out in this master's project deals with development of such models to explain OPB mechanism in mooring chain links. In this thesis, a new interlink stiffness model is developed to describe the nonlinear hysteritic relationship between OPB moment and interlink angle. The interlink stiffness model is then applied to a system <b>of</b> <b>chain</b> links using two different methods: a physics based approach and a semi-empirical approach. Each of these methods present a new approach to idealize a system <b>of</b> <b>chain</b> links.

To verify this methodology, a comparative study is performed at the end in which coupled floatermooring analysis is carried out with and without including the interlink stiffness <b>of</b> <b>chain</b> links.
