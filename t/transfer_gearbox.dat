25|$|Tests showed this {{prototype}} {{vehicle to}} be a capable and versatile machine. The PTO drives {{from the front}} of the engine and from the gearbox to the centre and rear of the vehicle allowed it to drive farm machinery, exactly as a tractor would. It was also tested ploughing and performing other agricultural tasks. However, as the vehicle was readied for production, this emphasis on tractor-like usage decreased and the centre steering proved impractical in use. The steering wheel was mounted off to the side as normal, the bodywork was simplified to reduce production time and costs and a larger engine was fitted, together with a specially designed <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> to replace the Jeep unit. The result was a vehicle that didn't use a single Jeep component and was slightly shorter than its American inspiration, but wider, heavier, faster and still retained the PTO drives.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} fire engines to arrive {{were unable to}} do much to stop the fire, as the drivers misjudged their distance, and also making foam {{required}} the main <b>transfer</b> <b>gearboxes</b> of the fire engines to be operated, which meant that the vehicles were unable to move while doing so. Problems with couplings on the fire hoses exacerbated the situation – [...] the fire hydrants had been regularly painted, and a build up of paint on the coupling threads prevented the hoses from being attached to the hydrants. The driver of a back-up foam tender drove in closer to the burning aircraft and discharged his foam effectively, but the fire had already gained hold {{by the time this}} happened.|$|R
50|$|The power {{transmission}} is mechanical. It provides a constant transmission of torque {{from the engine}} to all the wheels. The {{power transmission}} comprises the following: <b>gearbox,</b> <b>transfer</b> box, wheel reducers, front and rear main transmissions, and cardan shaft.|$|R
50|$|On later models a {{standard}} four cylinder motor car engine, e.g. the Ford Anglia car 100E engine, provided power through {{a standard}} three speed gearbox {{to a final}} chain drive <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> which included the forward and reverse selection.|$|E
50|$|Snecma is {{in charge}} of the core engine, control system (FADEC), {{transmissions}} (accessory gearbox, <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox),</b> overall engine integration and flight testing. NPO Saturn is responsible for the components in the low pressure section and engine installation on the Sukhoi Superjet 100 regional aircraft and ground testing.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the gear}} {{reduction}} at the wheel which lessens the torque on all the other drivetrain components, {{the size of the}} differential casing can be reduced to gain even more ground clearance. Additionally, all drivetrain elements, in particular the <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> and driveshafts, can be built lighter. This can be of use in lowering the center of gravity for a given ground clearance.|$|E
5000|$|In {{wind turbine}} generators, {{trunnions}} {{are used as}} two of three or more mounting points for the <b>gearbox</b> (<b>transferring</b> power from the rotor to the generator)which allows for limited movement due to torque variations and an accessible way to remote and service the drive-train [...]|$|R
500|$|However, the {{z-parameters}} are {{not necessarily}} the most convenient for characterising gear trains. [...] A gear train is the analogue of an electrical transformer and the h-parameters (hybrid parameters) better describe transformers because they directly include the turns ratios (the analogue of gear ratios).

50|$|The 2008, {{the mass}} {{production}} of which also started, {{is the first}} product of the joint venture between the two companies of Peugeot and IKCO named IKAP. The 2008 features a 1.6 V4 naturally aspirated engine, producing 163 Hp with max torque of 243 Nm @ 4000 rpm. The 2008's six speed automatic <b>gearbox</b> <b>transfers</b> the engine power to the front wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> in the AWD models—the same {{as used in}} the Vauxhall Cavalier AWD—was {{somewhat}} on {{the flimsy}} side, liable to suffer damage from conditions such as minor differences in tyre wear or tyre pressure between front and rear axles. Since front and rear tyres would naturally wear at different rates in normal driving, {{it was necessary to}} swap front with rear tyres every 15000 mi.|$|E
50|$|All four tyres {{had to be}} of {{the same}} make and model, and all four tyres had to be {{replaced}} at the same time — if one tyre was damaged or punctured, the three remaining good tyres also had to be replaced. In addition there were other maintenance requirements which were both exacting and unusual. Neglect of these points through ignorance or a misconceived attempt to save money was common, and was likely to lead to very expensive failures of the <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E
50|$|The body is {{distinguished}} by its spare wheel {{mounted on the}} specially designed bonnet, its additional bumpers, front and rear, its flared wheel arches (for 1982), big optional tyres (for 1982) and tail lights similar to the Citroën Acadiane van.The 4x4 version has a gearbox with four normal speeds and a three-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> for crossing slopes up to 60%. At the time, the Méhari 4x4 {{was one of the}} few 4x4s with four-wheel independent suspension. The car had all wheel disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gearbox</b> <b>transfers</b> {{power from}} the main shaft of the engine to an {{oil-cooled}} generator for electrical power. Within the gearbox, power is also transferred to engine accessories such as the fuel control unit, the lubrication module, and cooling fan. In addition, {{there is also a}} starter motor connected through the gear train to perform the starting function of the APU. Some APU designs use a combination starter/generator for APU starting and electrical power generation to reduce complexity.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear marine {{propulsion}} is propulsion {{of a ship}} or submarine with heat provided by a nuclear power plant. The power plant heats water to produce steam {{and it is this}} steam that powers the steam turbines and turbo generators. The power is then <b>transferred</b> to a <b>gearbox</b> that reduces the ratio by around 50 to 1 and this powers the propulsor. Naval nuclear propulsion is used specifically within naval warships such as supercarriers. (see nuclear navy). Very few experimental civil nuclear ships have been built.|$|R
50|$|The RX three-door is {{comparatively}} rare as only 2600 {{units were}} made during its 1987 to 1989 production run. Very few remain operational today. It can {{be recognized by}} a rear wing, factory ground effects kit and white paint with white wheels. Most RXs were white, but a black version was produced {{in the last half}} of 1989. The RX was equipped with the EA82T turbo engine, as found in the sport-oriented XT Vortex mated to a five speed manual transmission (an AT version was available in 1989). The drivetrain featured a 3.70:1 rear Limited Slip Differential as well as a locking center differential and two speed <b>transfer</b> case. The <b>gearbox</b> also featured a shorter 1.192:1 low range gear set (vs the 1.592:1 found in non-turbo versions) activated via a center console mounted lever. Other characteristics were; rally tuned suspension, four wheel disc brakes, power windows, A/C, central locking differential, adjustable seats and steering wheel, split fold-down rear seats, full indicative panel, Hill Holder and 1070 kg of weight. 1989 marked the end of the production run for the RX.|$|R
50|$|The FAA {{issued an}} Airworthiness Directive (AD) on May 16, 2013, {{and sent it}} to owners and {{operators}} of General Electric GE90-110B1 and GE90-115B turbofan engines. This emergency AD was prompted by reports of two failures of <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> assemblies (TGBs) which resulted in in-flight shutdowns (IFSDs). Investigation revealed that the failures were caused by TGB radial gear cracking and separation. Further inspections found two additional radial gears with cracks. This condition, if not corrected, could result in additional IFSDs of one or more engines, loss of thrust control, and damage to the airplane. The Airworthiness Directive requires compliance by taking remedial measures within five days of receipt of the AD.|$|E
50|$|Later in 1941 the Japanese {{government}} told Toyota {{to produce}} a light truck for Japan's military. In 1942 Toyota developed the AK10 prototype by reverse-engineering a Bantam GP Jeep. The half-ton truck features an upright front grille, flat front wheel arches that angled down and back like the FJ40, headlights mounted above the wheel arches {{on either side of}} the radiator, and a folding windshield. The AK10 is powered by the 2259 cc, 4-cylinder Type C engine from the Toyota Model AE sedan coupled to a three-speed manual transmission and two-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox.</b> Unlike the U.S. Jeep, few AK10's were ever used and photographs of them in the battlefield are rare.|$|E
5000|$|Some manual {{transmissions}} have {{an extremely}} low ratio for first gear, called a creeper gear or granny gear. Such gears {{are usually not}} synchronized. This feature is common on pick-up trucks tailored to trailer-towing, farming, or construction-site work. During normal on-road use, the truck is usually driven without using the creeper gear at all, and second gear is used from a standing start. Some off-road vehicles, most particularly the Willy's Jeep and its descendants, also had transmissions with [...] "granny first's" [...] either as standard or an option, but this function is now more often provided for by a low-range <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> attached to a normal fully synchronized transmission.|$|E
50|$|Although bit of {{a misnomer}} as the boats aren't without limits, {{unlimited}} hydroplanes have much fewer restrictions than with limited hydroplane racing. These 30 foot, 6,800 lbs boats most often powered by a Lycoming T55-L7 turbine engine (used from the Vietnam era {{to the present day}} in the CH-47 Chinook military helicopter), which is capable of up to 3000 horsepower with current restrictions. The T55-L7 powerplant creates high speed rotational energy, which is <b>transferred</b> through a <b>gearbox</b> at around 50% gear reduction to reduce propeller RPM. Unlimited hydroplanes are capable of speeds of 200+ mph on the straightaways and qualifying average lap speeds range from 130-165 mph. Modern hulls are constructed of composite materials such as honeycomb aluminum, fiberglass, laminated resin and carbon fiber. Many of the restored, fully operable unlimited hydroplanes at the Hydroplane & Raceboat Museum in Kent, Washington (such as the Miss Wahoo and Miss Thriftway vintage restorations) still use piston-powered inline aircraft engines. The primary racing circuit for unlimited racing is the H1 Unlimited, whose season runs from mid-February through September, consisting of eight races. H1 Unlimited races occur throughout the United States, and the Middle East.|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines produce a fluctuating torque due to discrete pistons combustion, {{as well as}} induced inertial imbalance of the reciprocating pistons. In standard operating conditions, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are <b>transferred</b> to the <b>gearbox,</b> leading {{to a number of}} comfort problems. Rattle noise is one of these problems and it is caused by impulsive forces caused by clearances across the driveline and especially in the gearbox. In order to prevent rattle, dual mass flywheels may be used to reduce torsional oscillations in automotive powertrains. The present paper presents a 3 D nonlinear dynamic model of an automotive dual mass flywheel. The model is made of primary and secondary masses and the arc springs between them. Centrifugal effects and redirection forces acting on the springs as well as nonlinear contact forces due to stoppers and flanges bounding spring motion are accounted for. Moreover, friction occurring in seals and friction resulting from the spring radial forces are included. The developed dual mass flywheel model is included into a multi-body model of the vehicle powertrain to assess the effect of its main parameters on the driveline behaviour (e. g. modes of vibration, radial forces) ...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{effective}} wind turbine fault detection algorithm {{is not only}} meaningful for improving wind turbine reliability but also crucial for future intelligent wind farm operation and management. Typical wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring is based on vibration signals, which is effective to detect failures with high frequency signal range. But {{it may not be}} effective on low speed components which have low frequency signal characteristic of different failure modes. SCADA system collecting multiple low frequency signals provides a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines health and performance, while its capability on fault detection is still an open issue. To systematic understand wind turbine systems, this paper presents research results of model based wind turbine gearbox fault detection. Through a detail analysis of thermodynamic process of gearbox lubrication system, a wind turbine drive train model which considers heat <b>transferring</b> mechanism in <b>gearbox</b> lubrication system is built to derive robust relationships between transmission efficiency, temperature, and rotational speed signals of wind turbine gearbox and suggest useful information for lubrication system design and optimization. The result obtained in this work is useful for wind turbine gearbox design and effective algorithm development of fault detection...|$|R
50|$|The Centre Steer used a Rover 1.6 litre 4-cylinder {{petrol engine}} of 50 {{horsepower}} (37 kW). This was coupled to a 4-speed manual gearbox from the Rover P3 saloon. This unit was coupled to a Willys/Ford 2-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{taken from a}} Jeep. This not only allowed {{the selection of a}} lower set of 'crawler' gears but controlled the selection of drive to the front axle as well. The production 1948 Land Rover used the P3 gearbox, but an entirely different transfer box, designed and built by Rover, was fitted. This incorporated a Rover 'freewheel' mechanism to provide a permanent 4-wheel-drive system. The freewheel could be locked out to ensure full traction at both axles when off-road.|$|E

5000|$|Starting {{with the}} He 177 A-3/R2, a {{modified}} engine nacelle {{with a new}} [...] "power system", the Daimler-Benz DB 610, each of which consisted {{of a pair of}} Daimler-Benz DB 605s set up to work as one as the DB 606 had been, was used to eliminate the tendency for engine fires. With the introduction of the DB 610 came several improvements, including the relocation of the engine oil tank, the lengthening of the engine mountings by 20 cm (8 in), the complete redesign of the exhaust system (which also facilitated the installation of exhaust dampers for night missions), and the setting of a power limitation on the engines which resulted in greater reliability. These major and minor modifications, supposedly numbering 56, were successful in eliminating engine fires, but other minor problems remained, involving the <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> between the two component engines of each [...] "power system" [...] and their shared propeller.|$|E
5000|$|The G63 {{comes with}} the AMG SPEEDSHIFT PLUS 7G-TRONIC {{transmission}} and an ECO start/stop function and an AMG sports exhaust system. Furthermore, the suspension/damper settings are adjusted for more dynamic handling characteristics, by using optimised bearings for the automatic <b>gearbox,</b> <b>transfer</b> case and engine, cutting vibration and noise levels. It has AMG 5x2 spoke 9.5x20-inch titanium-grey-painted light alloy wheels with high-sheen finish and 275/50 R 20 tyres, AMG high-performance brakes 375x36 millimetres front and 330x20 millimetres rear discs, six-piston fixed front brake calliper from the ML63 AMG, single-piston floating rear caliper and red brake caliper colour.

50|$|In {{response}} to President Jimmy Carter's February 1977 directive to curtail arms proliferation by selling only reduced-capability weapons to foreign countries, General Dynamics developed a modified export-oriented {{version of the}} F-16A/B designed for use with the outdated General Electric J79 turbojet engine. Northrop competed for this market with its F-20 Tigershark. Accommodating the J79-GE-119 engine required modification of the F-16's inlet, the addition of steel heat shielding, a <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> (to connect the engine to the existing F-16 gearbox), and an 18-inch (46 cm) stretch of the aft fuselage. First flight occurred on 29 October 1980. The total program cost to develop the F-16/J79 was $18 million (1980), and the unit flyaway cost was projected to be about $8 million. South Korea, Pakistan and other nations were offered these fighters but rejected them, resulting in numerous exceptions being made to sell standard F-16s; with the later relaxation of the policy under President Carter in 1980 and its cancellation under President Ronald Reagan, no copies of either the F-16/79 or the F-20 were ultimately sold.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{prototype}} models was {{powered by a}} Perkins Diesel 2700cc 4 cylinder engine and was a 6-seater jeep {{and the other one}} had an EBRO-Nissan Diesel 2800c 4 cylinder engine and was a 3-seater pickup truck, both vehicles had 4WD axles, with its own 5 speed manual gearbox and VIASA-JEEP dualrange <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> for offroad driving and the cars were made in 1984, one of the few road vehicles that VIASA-JEEP made for other firms, after a week evaluation these prototypes became the basis for the then new original HISPARO Todoterreno 4X4. Current HISPARO Todoterreno production models were powered by standard PEGASO TD and PERKINS Diesel 4 cylinder engines, but very soon customers had also the choice of optional EBRO-NISSAN TD or ISUZU TDI modern running gear. Because ENASA produced mainly heavy-duty vehicles, so it was never designed for light and small vehicles, it was decided to transfer HISPARO 4X4 production to their other smaller ENASA factory at Sagrera in Barcelona where PEGASO light delivery model range were made since 1960, these were mainly pickup trucks, combivans and vans plus the new HISPARO 4X4 model range starting in early 1984. Near them in the same industrial estate, there is also the EBRO MOTOR IBERICA another motorvehicle factory, that makes similar vehicles and it is also a large company, now owned and run by the NISSAN MOTOR CO of Japan.|$|E
5000|$|From 2001 to 2004, the Ford Escape {{was sold}} in Europe under the Maverick name, and {{replaced}} a rebadged version of the Nissan Mistral/Terrano II. Only two versions were made, the 2.0 L Zetec inline 4 engine with manual transmission and 3.0 L Duratec V6 with automatic transmission, both using gasoline as fuel. The absence of a diesel version did not help sales and the vehicle was temporarily discontinued in late 2003. However, the Maverick, in the UK for example, was only available in XLT trim. Plus, the dashboard {{was not the same}} as the US Escape; it was instead taken from the Mazda Tribute. The Maverick was reintroduced in 2005 in certain European markets with the Duratec V6 engine. It was announced that the Maverick would be assembled in Russia for the Russian market. As of 2006, the Maverick was no longer sold in Europe, leaving Ford without a compact SUV until the 2008 Ford Kuga was introduced. The Maverick was primarily designed for on-road use - sold with normal road tires, and to be used with front-wheel drive most of the time. A second [...] "gear lever" [...] for the <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox</b> enabled four-wheel drive mode with no center differential and a limited slip rear differential - this precluded using full-time four-wheel drive on the road as it caused undue wear on the transmission and tires.|$|E
5000|$|The Steelman is a six-wheel {{shaft drive}} loco of 450 to 750 bhp. The first Steelman {{utilised}} the Rolls-Royce DV8TCA rated at 608 bhp at 1800 rpm and utilised a 2-speed [...] "warm change" [...] Wiseman <b>transfer</b> <b>gearbox,</b> giving the loco {{a top speed}} of 40 mph. The follow-on 4 locos - 3 with the Rolls-Royce DV8N (445 bhp) at 52tons and one with the DV8TCE (650 bhp) at 60tons - had re-designed bodywork and single speed transfer gearboxes. All five went to the British Steel Corporation. Rolls expected to develop 2-axle versions to replace the Sentinel models but the sale of Class 14 locos from BR adversely affected the market and without the volume of sales, higher unit costs precluded further development. Following Rolls-Royce's exit from loco building Thomas Hill took over the design, though resistance to it from Thomas Hill (senior) prevented it being offered until long after he'd retired, hence the regressive [...] "Titan" [...] design. The first two TH Steelman locos were built for ICI in 1984, and a sales drive within British Steel Ravenscraig resulted in their taking both the original 60Ton Steelman and the last of the production batch, which had meantime been the Varlen USA demonstrator and returned. Subsequently, Ravenscraig bought 2 new Steelman 60T 6w's using the Cat 3412, which power unit was also installed into a 75ton version for ARC Whatley Quarry.|$|E
