5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

However, instead of stepping over the opponent to flip <b>the</b> opponent, <b>the</b> <b>applying</b> wrestler flips <b>the</b> wrestler over from left-to-right, keeping the opponent in front of him/her. <b>The</b> <b>applying</b> wrestler then leans over the opponent and grabs his/her arms, applying a double chicken wing to <b>the</b> opponent. <b>The</b> <b>applying</b> wrestler then squats back, lifting the opponent's torso into the air. The move was used by Bull Nakano and later used by current WWE wrestler Paige.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in lightning arresters in electric power systems.

5|$|Europa Clipper — In July 2013 {{an updated}} concept for a flyby Europa mission called Europa Clipper was {{presented}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and <b>the</b> <b>Applied</b> Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the Europa Clipper mission, and revealed the instruments it will use. The aim of Europa Clipper is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid selecting sites for a future lander. The Europa Clipper would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared spectrometer, topographical imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{becomes a}} {{superconductor}} {{when it is}} cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This is because europium is divalent in the metallic state, and is converted into the trivalent state by <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = 7/2) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu3+).|$|E
30|$|The RPS {{generator}} should generate {{problems for}} “learning by {{positive and negative}} examples” as mentioned in <b>the</b> “Learning to <b>apply</b> conditions and <b>the</b> hierarchy of material classes by cognitive conflict” section. In order to generate positive examples, the RPS generator changes the CWM and PSPM of an original problem by keeping the application of conditions to the target knowledge. In case <b>the</b> <b>applying</b> condition is written by a phenomenon, the transformation is performed {{the same way as}} in (1). In case <b>the</b> <b>applying</b> condition is written for a material class, the RPS generator replaces the concrete material with another concrete material, which can then satisfy <b>the</b> <b>applying</b> conditions of <b>the</b> target knowledge. On the other hand, to generate negative examples, the RPS generator changes phenomenon or the material of <b>the</b> <b>applying</b> condition to other ones that cannot satisfy <b>the</b> <b>applying</b> condition. In this transformation, the RPS generator should replace the phenomenon or the material with a similar one as often as possible, as it will show learners the boundaries more clearly.|$|R

5|$|In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology {{reported}} {{producing an}} electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires.

Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.2–0.3mm and diameters of three to five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E

5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
25|$|Elastic {{deformation}} in solids is {{reversible change}} in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> force. If <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist <b>the</b> <b>applied</b> force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.|$|E
