Malta introduced the first renewable energy scheme in 2006, which promoted the use of Photovoltaic technology on a small scale. Most of the funding available was directed at improving the energy efficiency of appliances and housing. In 2010, the focus has moved on towards larger support for the preferred choice in renewable energy technology, namely photovoltaics, as Malta struggles to work towards achieving its 2020 renewable energy targets. There has been a relatively strong reliance on solar energy, with a very small attempt to introduce wind turbines, the use of biofuels in industry and no use of geothermal energy. While the expectation was that wind energy would play a major part in the national landscape of renewables, technological and regulatory hurdles faced resulted in this technology not featuring on any substantial scale in the residential sector the industrial sector in Malta. The policy in Malta is reflective of EU policy, and justification for intervention in the provision of renewable energy is strong. The implementation of such policy, however, is still in its infancy. Malta obtains ERDF and Cohesion funds under the Convergence Objective, under which it can obtain a maximum EU co-financing rate of 85 % of the <b>total</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>cost</b> of projects. This is complemented by national co-financing. Regional differences in such support exist between the two larger islands, Malta (Main Island) and Gozo. However, this is not specific to renewable energy projects but pertains to interventions in general, as the country had at one point committed 10 % of EU funding to the island of Gozo. Moreover, Gozo is designated to become an Eco-Island over the next years, with a specific budget line out of national resources devoted specifically to this purpose, which may impact upon rates of support applicable to renewable energy projects in the Island Region. Real estate market differentiation for energy efficient housing is almost non-existent, with very few signs of any references to this in the property marketN/...|$|E

40|$|The {{national}} {{approach to}} public {{funding of the}} film industry has been subject to a shift in recent years, at an international level, moving from a grant and subsidy scheme towards more automatic form of supports, including tax incentives. The paper aims at analysing {{the impact of the}} new tax credit measures for the Italian film industry, introduced in 2008, {{within the framework of the}} 2007 financial law, and in force since the third quarter of 2009. The impact is evaluated on both the domestic film production companies and on the State accounts level. The measure of tax credit for film with cultural requirements provides the film production company with the possibility of offsetting its tax debt (national and regional income tax, VAT, social contribution and costs) during the production, within a cap of 15 % of <b>total</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>costs.</b> Starting from the data collected and processed by the Ministry of Culture since the beginning of the implementation phase, the paper aims at demonstrating the positive balance for the State determined by the increase of private investments on film with cultural requirements and, consequently, of the induced direct and indirect tax return. A brief description of the measure will be followed by a comparison of the incremental value produced by the film sector throughout the year following the enforcement of the tax credit measures...|$|R
40|$|The Integrated Project EUROTRANS (EURopean Research Programme for the TRANSmutation of High Level Nuclear Waste in an Accelerator Driven System) {{within the}} ongoing EURATOM 6 th European Commission Framework Programme (FP 6) {{is devoted to}} the study of {{transmutation}} of high-level waste from nuclear power plants. The work is focused on transmutation in an Accelerator Driven System (ADS). The objective of EUROTRANS is the assessment of the design and the feasibility of an industrial ADS prototype dedicated to transmutation. The necessary R&D results in the areas of fuel development, structural materials, thermal-hydraulics, heavy liquid metal technology and nuclear data will be made available, together with the experimental demonstration of the ADS component coupling. The outcome of this work will allow to provide a reasonably reliable assessment of technological feasibility and a cost estimate for ADS based transmutation, and to possibly decide on the detailed design of an experimental ADS and its construction in the future. EUROTRANS is integrating critical masses of resources (23 M€ EC contribution, 43 M€ <b>total</b> <b>eligible</b> <b>costs)</b> and activities of 47 participants from 14 countries, within the industry (10 participants), the national research centres (19) and 17 universities in Europe. The universities are collectively represented by ENEN (European Nuclear Engineering Network). EUROTRANS is the logical continuation of the three FP 5 Clusters FUETRA, BASTRA and TESTRA together with the PDS-XADS Project. It takes credit from the Roadmap on P&T of the Technical Working Group [1]. EUROTRANS strengthens and consolidate the European research and development activities in transmutation. The involvement of universities strengthens education and training in nuclear technologies. The involvement of industries assures a market-oriented and economic design development and an effective dissemination of the results. Completato€ 65. 00...|$|R
