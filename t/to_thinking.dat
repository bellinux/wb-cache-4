5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Teachers' {{knowledge}} of self-directed learning {{and critical thinking}} are two predictors of learning in learners. This knowledge has impact on promotion of active learning process and academic achievement. This study evaluates the relation between tendency <b>to</b> critical <b>thinking</b> and self-direction in nursing and midwifery students and its role on their academic achievement. Methods: All undergraduate students of nursing and midwifery school Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (N= 550) were studies. Thirty nine percents (n= 214) of students responded (% 26 males and % 74 females). Method of study was descriptive. Results: There was no significant relationship between self-direction and tendency <b>to</b> critical <b>thinking</b> and Academic Achievement (P > 0. 05). However, there was significant and positive relationship between self-direction and tendency <b>to</b> critical <b>thinking</b> (P 0. 05). However there was significant difference between academic achievement {{of male and female}} students (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Results show that there is no significant relationship between self-direction and tendency <b>to</b> critical <b>thinking</b> and academic achievement.

500|$|The game {{utilizes}} a new in-house engine {{called the}} Northlight Engine. To represent {{the idea of}} [...] "broken time" [...] and have a detailed destruction system, the team created lots of environments which put the player character {{in the midst of}} destruction, utilizing technologies ranging from geometric distortion waves <b>to</b> <b>Thinking</b> Particles. The team also used Digital Molecular Matter, a technology developed by Pixelux that allows structures and objects to react in the game the same way they would in reality.

It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyoncé sings the hook-intro, [...] "To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, [...] "You must not know 'bout me...I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute...Don't you ever for a second get <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyoncé recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyoncé sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, [...] "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus. The Boston Globe noted that Beyoncé sings some parts {{of it in a}} higher register [...] "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".|$|E
500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics {{has three}} key aims, and, correspondingly, its {{chapters}} are split into three sections. These aims are {{the analysis of}} three key [...] "innovations" [...] that the editors identify in the book's introduction. The first {{of these is the}} move, in animal ethics, from thinking about personal change <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about the implementation of rules or norms of conduct at the societal level. The second of these is a possible rapprochement between animal ethics and ecologism (environmental ethics and green political theory). The third is the increased presence of animal protection laws for the benefit of nonhuman animals themselves. Aside from the introduction, the book features ten single-authored chapters, with three in Part I: The Politicization of the Animal Advocacy Discourse, three in Part II: The Rapprochement between Animal Ethics and Ecologism, and four in Part III: The Introduction of Laws and Institutions for the Benefit of Animals.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
500|$|Bell et al.′s {{objective}} was to test the explanations of how people become heterosexual or homosexual proposed by psychoanalysts and social scientists, to provide a firm scientific basis <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about sexual development and definitively refute mistaken theories. They wrote that the most notable proposed explanations of homosexuality were psychoanalytic theories attributing it to a failure to resolve Oedipal conflicts. In their view, theories {{about the origins of}} sexual orientation had usually not been rigorously tested prior to their study, partly because of the stigma associated with homosexuality and partly because some of the theories, including those advanced by psychoanalysts, use concepts which are hard to [...] "pin down and operationalize." [...] Bell et al. anticipated that psychologists and psychoanalysts would object to their work on methodological grounds, such as that no attempt was made to access unconscious material, or that the interviews, which lasted only a few hours as opposed to the hundreds of hours involved in an analysis, could never reveal what truly occurred in someone′s childhood. They argued, however, that the fact that their data was not obtained from clinical sources was a strength, that attempting to access unconscious material risks selective interpretation of the data, and that [...] "if the differences between homosexual and heterosexual patterns of development are really as great as psychoanalytic theory claims" [...] then such differences would be reflected to at least some extent in the reports of their respondents.|$|E

She was the child who inherited Victor’s (Eric Braeden) business acumen. He, being a male chauvinist, always viewed the more family oriented Nick as his heir apparent. Her struggle to get her father’s recognition is what fueled her." [...] She also stated that while watching the series, there was [...] "the sense that women could, if that was what interested them, be power players". Of Victoria's choice to leave Newman Enterprises, Bibel wrote: [...] "For Victoria, it came across as giving up Peggy Olsen’s life for Betty Draper’s. I was also peeved by her telling her mother that she didn’t have the first idea of how to become an author. She ran a major cosmetics company. She should have a hundred contacts in publishing, and the confidence and skills to figure out what she doesn’t know. I got <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about all of the ways that, over the past few months, the women of Genoa City have been, to use the lingo of Leaning In, the most popular non-fiction book in the country right now, leaning out."

500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E
500|$|Dylan's two {{previous}} albums, The Times They Are A-Changin' and Another Side of Bob Dylan both {{ended with a}} farewell song, [...] "Restless Farewell" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe" [...] respectively. [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] concludes Bringing It All Back Home in consistent fashion. Much speculation has surrounded who or what the [...] "Baby Blue" [...] to whom Dylan is singing farewell is. Although Dylan himself has remained mute on the subject, Dylan scholars {{believe that it is}} probably an amalgam of personalities within Dylan's social orbit. One person who has been regarded as the subject of the song is folk singer Joan Baez. Dylan and Baez were still in a relationship and were planning to tour together, but Dylan had been growing as an artist and as a person and may have already been planning to leave the relationship. Another possibility is a singer-songwriter named David Blue. A friend or acquaintance of Dylan's from his days in New York's Greenwich Village, Blue is pictured on the cover of Dylan and the Band's The Basement Tapes album wearing a trench coat. Yet another possibility is Dylan's one-time friend, folk singer Paul Clayton. Although Clayton had been Dylan's friend throughout 1964, and had accompanied Dylan on the road trip across the United States on which [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] were written, by 1965 he may have become more devoted to Dylan than Dylan was comfortable with, and Clayton's use of amphetamines may have made him difficult to be around. However, author Paul Williams, in his book Performing Artist: Book One 1960–1973, counters that [...] "Dylan may have been thinking of a particular person as he wrote it, but not necessarily", adding that the song has such a natural, flowing structure to it, that it could [...] "easily have finished writing itself before Dylan got around <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about who 'Baby Blue' was." ...|$|E
