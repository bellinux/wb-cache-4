5|$|In short, the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical rudder. Its role was not to change the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> when leveling off from <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> wind disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E
5|$|Campaign school, Campagneschule or Campagne, {{where the}} horse learns {{collection}} and balance through all gaits, <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> maneuvers. The horse learns to shorten and lengthen his stride, perform lateral movements to the side, and is {{introduced to the}} more complex double bridle. This is the longest training phase and may take several years.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E

5|$|Experimental robots {{have had}} the same inspiration, in {{particular}} when heavy loads are needed to be carried in tight areas involving <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> curves. In biology, some authors have advocated millipedes as model organisms for the study of arthropod physiology and the developmental processes controlling the number and shape of body segments.|$|E
5|$|Signed as a northsouth route, it {{lies that}} way at the {{southern}} end, but about midway along its length the road <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> thence travels eastwest. Excluding its termini, {{there are only two}} junctions with other roadways along the entire route. It is the only instance in New York of a route designated without an alphabetic suffix that terminates at both ends at suffixed routes.|$|E
5|$|The South Circular Road (formally the A205 {{and often}} simply called the South Circular) in south London, England, {{is a major}} road that runs from the Woolwich Ferry in the east to the Chiswick Flyover in the west via Catford, Dulwich, Clapham Common, Wandsworth and Kew Bridge. Together with the North Circular Road and Woolwich Ferry, it makes a {{complete}} ring-road around Central London. The South Circular is largely a sequence of urban streets joined together, requiring several at-grade <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> is frequently congested.|$|E

5|$|The {{demonstration}} profile {{as designed}} by Holland included a 360° turn around Fairchild's air-traffic-control tower. Holland had not attempted this maneuver in previous air-show demonstrations. During the final flight, Holland performed {{a series of}} 60° banked <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> a 68° pitch climb in violation of Brooks' orders. No evidence exists that McGeehan or Wolff attempted to intervene as Holland executed the maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} relocations along {{what is now}} K-383 {{occurred}} in Norton. US-36 and US-83 originally entered the city along Washington Street, turned north onto First Avenue, and turned east onto Main Street. The highway followed Main Street {{out of town and}} along a road paralleling the railroad to the present highway. The first realignment was authorized in 1936 to eliminate several right-angle <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> several at-grade railroad crossings. East of the intersection of First and Main, US-36 and US-83 turned north onto State Street and followed the highway to Holme Street, where the highways joined the present course. By 1941, this change was deemed unsatisfactory due to the continued existence of right-angle <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> grade crossings. Shortly thereafter, the highways were moved to their present course bypassing downtown Norton.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} two <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> {{disappeared}} down the stairway {{that led to the}} underground restaurant. Sergeant Flannagan saw Byrne's companion <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> look back just as Flannagan stepped from the doorway to cross the street after them.|$|R

5|$|When the Landlords {{arrive at}} the Axe Gang casino to settle the score, Sum sends the Beast to fight them. During the fight, he stabs both with hidden blades, {{weakening}} but not defeating them. Sum orders Sing to strike the Landlord to break the stalemate, but Sing has {{a change of heart}} and strikes the Beast instead. The Beast <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> pummels Sing until he is rescued by the Landlords and taken back to Pig Sty Alley. The Beast kills Sum for disrupting his fight, and then orders an all-out assault on Pig Sty Alley.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers {{all of the}} people who still had some knowledge of the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all of the races. They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces all Men to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E
5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E
50|$|The front {{truck is}} usually mounted on wedged risers to {{increase}} the quickness of the <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> set up with soft bushings. The rear truck {{on the other hand}} is de-wedged, to reduce the <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> set up to be stiff, with harder bushings.|$|R

5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, {{construction}} {{began on}} a $5.5million project {{to improve the}} intersection between Clover Street (NY65) and Jefferson Road (NY252) {{in the town of}} Pittsford. The project, which had been in development for a decade, involved the widening of Jefferson Road from two to four lanes {{in the vicinity of the}} intersection, the addition of green arrow signal lights for all left-hand <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> the installation of sidewalks alongside both Clover Street and Jefferson Road. Work on the project was temporarily halted during the winter months; however, it resumed on April1, 2009. The project was completed in late 2009.|$|E
5|$|SR 20 rises {{into the}} Sierra {{along the north}} side of the Yuba River, {{crossing}} to the south side near Smartsville and then climbing through several ravines to the Penn Valley. The current alignment, built in the mid-1980s as a mostly two-lane freeway, continues east across rugged terrain to the city of Grass Valley, where it joins SR 49 on the Golden Center Freeway. The two routes travel northeast to Nevada City, where SR 49 turns northwest and SR 20 resumes its eastward course as a two-lane highway. The roadway climbs from Nevada City and follows Harmony Ridge and Washington Ridge before descending into the Bear Valley via a series of hairpin <b>turns,</b> <b>and</b> then climbing, just north of Emigrant Gap, to its end at I-80 at Yuba Pass. The Pioneer Trail, a National Recreation Trail, parallels SR 20 from a point on Harmony Ridge to the Bear Valley, and includes parts of a branch of the California Trail first used in 1850.|$|E

5|$|Scaramanga then {{proposes a}} pistol duel with Bond on the beach; {{the two men}} stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands {{in the place of}} a {{mannequin}} of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the helium of the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese junk. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.|$|E
5|$|The B {{bill was}} again {{examined}} by a joint committee under Lord Windsor. The GN bill was examined by a separate committee under Lord Ribblesdale. The B's eastward extension to Holborn {{to connect to}} the GN was permitted, but the extension to Parsons Green was rejected following objections from hospitals in the Fulham Road, which were concerned that vibrations from trains might affect their patients. The B link from Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross was rejected {{on the grounds that}} it involved sharp <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> steep gradients to avoid public buildings in the area. The merger with the GN and name change were permitted. The GN's extension to Temple was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk who owned the land under which it would have run. The abandonment of the route north of Finsbury Park was permitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} {{focuses on}} the invasion and land battles of Iwo Jima. The player commands the United States Marine Corps against the Imperial Japanese Army, who are occupying the islands {{as part of the}} Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass. Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends. During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the United States Navy fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be wiped out. The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits.|$|E
