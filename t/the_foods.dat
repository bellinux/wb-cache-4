5|$|There {{are some}} {{variations}} in <b>the</b> <b>foods</b> that are eaten around the {{different areas of}} Wales. These variations trace their roots back to medieval cooking. Ingredients were historically limited by what could be grown; the wetter climate in highland areas meant that crops were restricted to oats, whilst the more fertile lowland areas allowed the growth of barley or wheat. Coastal inhabitants {{were more likely to}} include seafood or seaweed in their meals, whilst those living inland would supplement their farmed cereals with the seeds of land weeds to ensure there was enough to eat.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} about 230 tropical botanical gardens with a concentration in southern and south-eastern Asia. The first botanical garden {{founded in the}} tropics was the Pamplemousses Botanical Garden in Mauritius, established in 1735 to provide food for ships using the port, but later trialling and distributing many plants of economic importance. This {{was followed by the}} West Indies (Botanic Gardens St. Vincent, 1764) and in 1786 by the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden in Calcutta, India founded during a period of prosperity when the city was a trading centre for the Dutch East India Company. Other gardens were constructed in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, 1808), Sri Lanka (Botanical Garden of Peradeniya, 1821 and on a site dating back to 1371), Indonesia (Bogor Botanical Gardens, 1817 and Kebun Raya Cibodas, 1852), and Singapore (Singapore Botanical Gardens, 1822). These {{had a profound effect on}} the economy of the countries, especially in relation to <b>the</b> <b>foods</b> and medicines introduced. The importation of rubber trees to the Singapore Botanic Garden initiated the important rubber industry of the Malay Peninsula. At this time also, teak and tea were introduced to India and breadfruit, pepper and starfruit to the Caribbean.|$|E

40|$|The study aims to {{investigate}} the advanced logistics supply chain for food management using green logistics. To protect <b>the</b> <b>food</b> logistics environment and prevent the environmental pollution, {{it is crucial to}} establish powerful modern supply chains to support <b>the</b> <b>food</b> management in transportation. The construction speed of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> companies is very fast; however, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply lags behind <b>the</b> <b>food</b> companies. As a result, the environmental pollution caused in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> logistics becomes severe. To improve this situation, a new logistics supply chain for <b>food</b> management using <b>the</b> environmental logistics theory is proposed in this study. The design and analysis of <b>the</b> proposed <b>food</b> supply chain system has been introduced. By the use of advanced environmental logistics theory, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply can be operated in an effective and green manner. Hence, the proposed new logistics supply chain can reduce the environmental pollution of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> logistics and improve <b>the</b> <b>food</b> market environment...|$|R

This behavior will greatly increase {{the cost of}} illegality of the node, and restrain <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>food</b> safety risk. (2) Weak inspecting every segment of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply chain, and light punishment on illegal node in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply chain. This would lose the effect of supervise, and increase the incidence probability of food safety risk. On the other hand, the behavior choice for the prosecuting of <b>the</b> problem of <b>food</b> unsafe. (1) Positive dealing with complaint, and severely punish the illegal node in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply chain. This can effectively protect {{the interests of the}} related subject, and restrain <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>food</b> safety risk. (2) Negative dealing with complaint.

25|$|Wide {{variability}} {{exists in}} the way the paleo diet is interpreted.

The ideas behind the diet can be traced to Walter Voegtlin, and were popularized in the best-selling books of Loren Cordain.|$|E

One method is to place a plank or an unperforated tray on the grill as a base upon which to cook. If the plank is made from wood and is soaked before grilling, the wood can then be used to impart flavor to <b>the</b> <b>food.</b> Another method of indirect grilling is to place a physical barrier such as a pizza stone between the fire and <b>the</b> <b>food.</b> <b>The</b> heat rises from the fire {{around the edges of the}} barrier and then circulates around <b>the</b> <b>food.</b> Most brands of kamado style outdoor cookers have accessories known as heat deflectors which can be placed above the fire and below <b>the</b> <b>food</b> grate.|$|R
