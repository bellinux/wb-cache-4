5|$|There was one driver change {{heading into}} the race. Having been {{in one of the}} Jordan cars since the first race of the season in Australia, Heinz-Harald Frentzen was sacked by his team and was {{replaced}} by Jordan's third driver Zonta.

The Schumacher brothers were sympathic towards Frentzen who felt unhappy about the manner in which he was sacked. Irvine came to Jordan's defence and said that he believed the decision was influenced by problems Jordan had with 1996 World Champion Damon Hill who had similar poor performances like Frentzen.
