5|$|The <b>Tempest</b> {{has only}} one female character, Miranda. Other women, such as Caliban's mother Sycorax, Miranda's mother and Alonso's {{daughter}} Claribel, are only mentioned. Because of the small role women play in the story in comparison to other Shakespeare plays, The <b>Tempest</b> has attracted much feminist criticism. Miranda is typically viewed as being completely deprived of freedom by her father. Her only duty in his eyes is to remain chaste. Ann Thompson argues that Miranda, in a manner typical of women in a colonial atmosphere, has completely internalised the patriarchal order of things, thinking of herself as subordinate to her father.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Tempest</b> {{is thought}} by most {{scholars}} {{to have been}} written in 1610–11, and is generally accepted as the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone, although some have questioned either or both assertions. Scholars also note {{that it is impossible}} to determine if the play was written before, after, or at the same time as The Winter's Tale, the dating of which has been equally problematic. Edward Blount entered The <b>Tempest</b> into the Stationers' Register on 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespearean plays that Blount registered on that date.|$|E
