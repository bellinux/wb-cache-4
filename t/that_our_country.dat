500|$|As an {{administrator}} Marlborough was also without peer; {{his attention to}} detail meant his troops rarely went short of supply – when his army arrived at its destination it was intact and in a fit state to fight. This concern {{for the welfare of}} the common soldier together with his ability to inspire trust and confidence, and his willingness to share the dangers of battle, often earned him adulation from his men – [...] "The known world could not produce a man of more humanity", observed Corporal Matthew Bishop. It was this range of abilities that makes Marlborough outstanding. Even his old adversaries recognised the Duke's qualities. In his Letters on the Study of History (1752), Bolingbroke declared – [...] "I take with pleasure this opportunity of doing justice to that great man... as the greatest general, and as the greatest minister <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>country,</b> or perhaps any other has produced, I honour". His success was made possible because of his enormous reserves of stamina, willpower and self-discipline; his ability to hold together the Alliance against France, made possible by his victories, can hardly be overestimated.|$|E

Following this announcement, which was interpreted by financial markets as making Brexit more probable, the pound sterling slumped by nearly 2% to its lowest level since March 2009. When Obama urged the UK {{to remain in the}} EU, Johnson alleged that the President was motivated by anti-British sentiment caused by his Kenyan ancestry.
