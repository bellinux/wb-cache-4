25|$|Yellowstone {{anchored}} at Quiberon Bay at 0953 on 14 February 1919. Her troubles {{were not}} over, however, as she grazed the jetty wall while entering the locks at St. Nazaire. At 0545, the engineer officer {{reported to the}} captain that two boilers were under water and the steam was cut off. As Yellowstone moored alongside the nearby quay, her crew broke out a tarpaulin and collision mat. Soon thereafter, Yellowstone, still with way on, nudged into the bridge walk of the lock. By 0630, under tow by a French tug, she reached a safe basin, where she dropped both anchors and her crew began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>stock</b> of the situation. Divers examining the damage reported that a hole, six inches (15.2cm) in width, had been opened up in Yellowstones side, extending from a point 10 feet (3 meters) beneath the waterline and about six feet (1.8 meters) in length. Drydocked on 11 March 1919, Yellowstone grazed the French passenger ship SS Alesia that morning, causing minor damage to Alesias railings on her promenade deck and boat deck.|$|E
25|$|France Jr. was {{instrumental}} in taking the sport outside of its traditional American base. In 1981 he {{struck a deal with}} multimillion-dollar Australian tire retailer and retired racer Bob Jane <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>stock</b> car racing to Australia and plans were laid out for a high-banked speedway at the Jane owned Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne. The 1.119mi (1.801km) Calder Park Thunderdome, the first high-banked NASCAR style speedway built outside of North America, was built at a cost of A$54 million and was opened in 1987. The new track, modelled on a scaled down version of the Charlotte Motor Speedway, including mimicking its 24° banked turns, held its first NASCAR race, the Goodyear NASCAR 500 (for 500km) on February 28, 1988 and was won by Alabama Gang member Neil Bonnet driving a Pontiac Grand Prix. Although only an exhibition race, this was also the first NASCAR race held outside of North America. Jane became the head of the sanctioning body for stock car racing in Australia known as Australian Stock Car Auto Racing (AUSCAR), though a falling out between him and France in 1991 saw NASCAR withdraw its support for Jane and his track. NASCAR racing in Australia continued to be sanctioned by Jane until the series folded in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Samhain {{was a time}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>stock</b> of {{the herds}} and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter {{pastures}} after six months in the higher summer pastures. It was also the time to choose which animals {{would need to be}} slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass is gone and free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal – usually a rooster, goose or sheep – would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.|$|E

500|$|That night, Wootten decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>stock</b> of {{the slow}} {{progress}} {{along the southern}} and central routes.

These men {{were believed to be}} from the 80th Infantry Regiment, which the Australians felt was close to exhaustion and unlikely to be able to withstand any further pressure. As a result of this information, Wootten decided to change the concept of operations. Although the 2/24th Battalion's attack on the 2,200 feature had originally been intended to serve as a holding action, the lack of progress by the 2/48th and 2/23rd encouraged Wootten to order the 26th Brigade's commander, Whitehead, to concentrate his efforts upon the 2,200 feature, turning the drive on Sattelberg into a [...] "double-pronged" [...] attack, with the 2/24th also attempting to break through to Sattelberg.|$|E

500|$|A great {{council was}} called in October and November <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>stock</b> of the post-war situation; this council {{is thought to have}} {{formulated}} and issued the Charter of 1217. The charter resembled that of 1216, although some additional clauses were added {{to protect the rights of}} the barons over their feudal subjects, and the restrictions on the Crown's ability to levy taxation were watered down. There remained a range of disagreements about the management of the royal forests, which involved a special legal system that had resulted in a source of considerable royal revenue; complaints existed over both the implementation of these courts, and the geographic boundaries of the royal forests. A complementary charter, the Charter of the Forest, was created, pardoning existing forest offences, imposing new controls over the forest courts, and establishing a review of the forest boundaries. To distinguish the two charters, the term magna carta libertatum, [...] "the great charter of liberties", was used by the scribes to refer to the larger document, which in time became known simply as Magna Carta.|$|E
