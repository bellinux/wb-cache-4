5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{porbeagle}} remains {{are known}} from Late Miocene epoch (c. 7.2 Ma) deposits in Belgium and the Netherlands, Pliocene epoch (5.3–2.6 Ma) deposits in Belgium, Spain, and Chile, and Pleistocene epoch (2.6 Ma to 12,000 BP) deposits in the Netherlands. However, Lamna teeth that closely {{resemble those of}} the porbeagle {{have been found in}} the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, which date to the middle to late Eocene epoch (50–34 Ma). There is much taxonomic confusion regarding Lamna in the fossil record due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of variability in adult tooth morphology within species.|$|E
5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor {{in some of the}} extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, {{the long}} history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, {{particularly}} Old Norse and Norman French, left a profound mark of their own on the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.|$|E
5|$|In {{geological}} terms at 7million {{years old}} Lord Howe Island is relatively young {{and was never}} part of any continent, its flora and fauna colonising the island from across the sea, carried by wind, water or birds, possibly assisted at a geological time when other islands were exposed, enabling island hopping. Nevertheless, it is far enough away and has had sufficient time to evolve endemic species. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of endemism is emphasised {{by the presence of}} five endemic genera: Negria, Lordhowea, Howea, Lepidorrhachis, and Hedyscepe. Island plants {{are similar to those of}} Norfolk Island, the two islands sharing some endemic species, for example, the critically endangered species of creeping vine Calystegia affinis. The combined flora of these two islands is more closely related to that of New Zealand and New Caledonia than to that of Australia. There is also a small but clear link with the plants of Vanuatu. The closest mainland affinities are with the vegetation of subtropical southeastern Queensland. A link with Gondwanaland is indicated by the presence of endemic species like the wedding lily (Dietes robinsoniana) whose only living relatives occur in South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough now {{requested}} Eugene {{to release}} Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> {{of confidence and}} mutual co-operation between the two generals. Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry. Fugger's cuirassiers charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder. With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim {{so that they could}} not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
