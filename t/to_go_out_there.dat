When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made {{that is going to be}} my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

The family was in town.... <b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and face {{one of the best}} pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in.

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fiesta Bowl {{bypassed}} Virginia Tech {{in favor of}} lower-ranked Notre Dame, protests from Tech fans and opponents of the BCS system erupted. Some said the selection was [...] "unfair", that Virginia Tech was [...] "hosed", or that the pick of Notre Dame was a [...] "snub" [...] of the Hokies. In an interview immediately after the selection, Vick said the Gator Bowl bid provided motivation to win the Gator Bowl. [...] "We're going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and make a statement, play a great game and show the nation", he said. Clemson, on the other hand, was enthusiastic about the Gator Bowl bid. A win in the game {{would have given the}} Tigers their first 10-win season since 1990, and the Gator Bowl appearance marked a continued improvement over its showing the previous year. Clemson players viewed the game as a reward for a successful season, while Virginia Tech players perceived it from a more workmanlike point of view.|$|E

Lappas said, [...] "What {{else do you}} say about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its great to see Anthony have six points in the game and win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance. It's good for him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and play and direct these kids that he has out there under him."

500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|Mystic Quest was {{developed}} in a graphic and gameplay style similar to Final Fantasy Legend III (part of the aforementioned SaGa series). The gameplay shares numerous similarities with that title, featuring a very similar battle system, graphical interface, and dungeon system. Even the jump feature from Final Fantasy Legend III has been reproduced, {{and almost all of}} the icons - from caves to the enemy sprites - are a color-upgraded version of Final Fantasy Legend IIIs character set. Besides allowing for computer-controlled allies, the game did away with random battles, complicated storylines, and text-based menus. To appeal to the perceived tastes of North American audiences, which gravitated towards fast-paced games, Square included action-adventure game elements; players could now brandish weapons outside of battle, jump, use a grappling hook, and set bombs to open new paths. North American translator Ted Woolsey explained that [...] "The action/adventure players...are larger in numbers and the demographic is different. They tend to be younger and like the idea of jumping straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it's an empowerment issue - you get <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> start whacking things and it feels good! With the more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing before you're finally hooked." [...] Woolsey stated that Mystic Quest was one of the easiest games he had to translate, due to the game's small size. Because the game was marketed towards a younger demographic, the game sold for US$39.99. Mystic Quest also came with an Official Strategy Guide that helped inexperienced and new RPG players complete it.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to have some plan formed, by which you can walk on the common in recesses, but there are difficulties. If all should <b>go</b> <b>out</b> together, it is {{probable}} that some would be rude and noisy, and that others would come back tardy and out of breath. Besides, as the recess is short, so many would be in haste <b>to</b> prepare <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> that <b>there</b> would be a great crowd and much confusion in the Ante-room and passage ways. I do not mention these as insuperable objections, but only as difficulties which there must be some plan to avoid. Perhaps, however, they cannot be avoided. Do any of you think of any plan?" ...|$|R

2500|$|At first, {{new members}} of the co-op felt, on average, that they should save more scrip before they began spending.

Since babysitting opportunities only arise when other couples want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> was a shortage of demand for babysitting. As a result, the co-op fell into a [...] "recession". This illustrates the phenomenon known as the paradox of thrift.|$|E

Gangs announced through speakers and flyers that other people were not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> as <b>there</b> would be fighting.

5000|$|If {{a player}} {{is able to}} meld all of their cards at once, they may say [...] "Rummy" [...] on their turn and <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> <b>To</b> declare Rummy, a player must not have melded or laid off any cards prior during the hand. If playing with the discard rule, they must also discard after melding. If a player goes rummy when a card can be played, that player is out for that turn. Game players are still in game but the hand goes dead. Playing for Rummy is more risky, but it carries the reward of double the score. Each player must wait until their second turn <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> If <b>there</b> is a rummy lying in the pile, the player who called [...] "rummy" [...] can play that card while the player who laid the rummy must then draw 2 cards from the stock pile or pick up the entire {{discarded}} pile.|$|R

60|$|Rollo {{was writing}} a course of French {{exercise}}s, and his task was one lesson for every day. The rule was, {{that he was to}} write this exercise immediately after breakfast, unless he had written it before; that is, either on the same day before breakfast, or on a previous day. Now, Rollo desired to be free after breakfast, for that was a very pleasant time <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> Besides, <b>there</b> were often plans and excursions formed for that time, which he was invited to join; and he could not join them unless his lesson for the day had been written. So he took pains to write his exercises, as much as possible, in advance. Whenever there came a rainy day he would write two or three lessons, and sometimes he would write early in the morning. He was now nearly a week in advance. Instead of being satisfied with this, however, he began to be quite interested in seeing how far ahead he could get. This feeling was what led him to think that he would take this opportunity to write a French lesson.|$|R

It is such grandeur, too, to the cub, {{to get a chance to}} give an order; for often the pilot will simply say, 'Let her go about!' and leave the rest to the cub, who instantly cries, in his sternest tone of command, 'Ease starboard! Strong on the larboard! Starboard give way! With a will, men!' The cub enjoys sounding for the further reason that the eyes of the passengers are watching all the yawl's movements with absorbing interest if the time be daylight; and if it be night he knows that those same wondering eyes are fastened upon the yawl's lantern as it glides out into the gloom and dims away in the remote distance.|$|R
