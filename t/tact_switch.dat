40|$|Wehave been {{developing}} {{a support system}} for the visually disabled to actively recognize threedimensional objects or environments, as an application system of 3 D computer vision. This is a total system which has input, processing, and output functions. Using a stereo camera system as an input device allows 3 D visual information to be obtained. The visual information is converted into tactile and auditory information which can be understood easily by the visually disabled. As one of the output devices, we have developed an interactive tactile display, which presents visual patterns by tactile pins arranged in two-dimensional format. The pin height can be set to several levels to increase the touch information and to display a 3 D surface shape. Also, each pin has a <b>tact</b> <b>switch</b> at the bottom for the user {{to make the system}} know the position by pushing it.

This paper describes the hardware and software of the system. tactile display and a voice synthesizer. The 3 D data obtained is not just raw image data, it is analyzed structurally and only the required visual information is selected according to the user's demand. There are two senses, tactile sense and auditory sense, for the visually disabled instead of sight. The former is superior to understanding the relative position in 2 D and 3 D space and the shape of objects. The latter is suitable for knowing the concepts. On these busies, we developed a 3 D tactile display with the function of a digitizer. Since the tactile display offers familiarity with image data and our technologies of 3 D tactile display, we selected it and added the function of the digitizer so users can not only be given tactile and auditory information but they can also select the required information from the system {{to make it easier to}} understand the 3 D world. There is no other total system which includes everything input to output and has interactive interface. In this paper we introduce the hardware and software of this interactive tactile display system. ...|$|E
40|$|Many ways of {{communications}} are used between human and computer, while using gesture {{is considered to}} be one of the most natural way in a virtual reality system. Because of its intuitiveness and its capability of helping the hearing impaired or speaking impaired, we develop a gesture recognition system. Considering the world-wide use of ASL (American Sign Language), this system focuses on the recognition of a continuous flow of alphabets in ASL to spell a word followed by the speech synthesis, and adopts a simple and efficient windowed template matching recognition strategy to achieve the goal of a real-time and continuous recognition. In addition to the abduction and the flex information in a gesture, we introduce a concept of contact-point into our system to solve the intrinsic ambiguities of some gestures in ASL. Five <b>tact</b> <b>switches,</b> served as contact-points and sensed by an analogue to digital board, are sewn on a glove cover to enhance the functions of a traditional data glov [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The cost of {{poor health}} has {{in recent years}} caused an {{extensive}} economic burden to the state as expensive laboratory measurement methods are heavily relied upon. As we make effort to lower this cost researchers attempt to identify ecological real world techniques, which can monitor health indices on a day to day basis, whilst still having a cost benefit. One such technique which has been identified has been the use of low cost inertial sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and combined units. These units have been successfully utilised in home rehabilitation methods, in silver age technologies to detect falls and extensively in the measurement of physical activity levels across all age groups. Due to their success, nowadays a large market of inertial sensors are available to the researcher or diagnostician with various types on offer in terms of size, site of attachment, data collection type and data output. However, this enhanced choice therefore leads to an increased need to investigate on a sensor-to-sensor basis how feasible specific inertial sensors are when applied to longitudinal data collection. Recently, {{as part of a}} larger study, ShimmerTM 2 r accelerometer (with combined gyroscope daughterboards) units were utilised in longitudinal data collection with varying results. These units are cased within a lightweight, plastic casing allowing for a robust outer unit, however inner processing board <b>tact</b> <b>switches</b> failed and needed replacement on numerous occasions. These switches provide the on/off switch for the overall sensor therefore leading to loss of data collection periods, vital in longitudinal studies. Along with this the units are decreasingly “user friendly” in terms of data collection procedures compared to other available units and also require an extensive amount of programming knowledge in terms of sensor data extraction and parameter identification. However, the output of raw data, as done with the Shimmer 2 r units, can also be a major advantage within data collection as this allows for an extensive amount of versatility in terms of the parameters identified. This also increases the sensors available uses across a range of activities. Conclusions: Whilst inertial sensors will have an increasing role in public health measurement careful consideration must be undertaken when choosing the correct unit. Of vital consideration in the “user friendly” properties of the unit to increase application and validity of results...|$|R
