During the product variant design, dimensional tolerance variant design plays an important role. However, dimensional tolerance variant design is considered rarely in the researches of product variant design. To solve the dimensional tolerance variant design during product variant design, information expression, extraction and labeling method <b>of</b> <b>dimensioning</b> <b>of</b> dimensional <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> part <b>dimension</b> model is investigated. A variant design method with dimensional tolerance is presented in this paper. In the method, dimension variant design and dimensional tolerance variant design are integrated, so dimension variant design and dimensional tolerance variant design are implemented concurrently. A part variant design module with dimension and dimensional tolerance based on SolidWorks is developed for using Visual C++. Finally, an example of shaft illustrates the proposed method...|$|R

In this paper, the dispersions method known as the Δl method which proved reliable in the simulation <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>dimensions</b> is used to develop a methodology for the automation of the simulation. This methodology is constructed around three procedures. The first procedure executes the verification of the functional requirements by automatically extracting the functional dimension chains in the mechanical sub-assembly. Then a second procedure performs an optimization of the dispersions on the basis of unknown variables. The third procedure uses the optimized values of the dispersions to compute the optimized average values and <b>tolerances</b> <b>of</b> the functional <b>dimensions</b> in the chains.

A promising alternative to full-time human involvement is the use of semi-autonomous, intelligent robot systems. To automate tasks such as assembly, disassembly, repair and maintenance, the issues presented by environmental uncertainties need to be addressed. These uncertainties are introduced by variations in the computed position of the robot at different locations in its work envelope, variations in part positioning, and <b>tolerances</b> <b>of</b> part <b>dimensions.</b> As a result, the robot system {{may not be able to}} accomplish the desired task without the help of sensor feedback.

40|$|AbstractTolerances of {{components}} can accumulate {{to result in}} quality variations when these components are assembled. One {{way to reduce the}} assembled variation is to tighten <b>tolerance</b> specifications <b>of</b> each component that, however, increases product cost. This paper investigates the effect of grouping for components with uniform and normal distributions by the developed “grouped random assembly” method. It is a method that first sorts and divides components into several groups and then assemble each group with corresponding group in order to reducing assembly <b>tolerance.</b> Distribution <b>of</b> resultant <b>dimension</b> based on the “grouped random assembly” approach is then analyzed. The results showed that, without changing components’ tolerance specifications, assembly tolerance depends on the number <b>of</b> grouping. <b>Tolerance</b> stack-up can be dramatically reduced with a suitable grouping strategy.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method that}} allows tolerances on critical dimensions to be assigned with respect to both quality and manufacturing cost. To be able to quantify and include customer needs in the process <b>of</b> assigning <b>tolerances,</b> the concept <b>of</b> functionality loss is used. Functionality loss, as used here, differs from the concept of quality loss suggested by Taguchi. Loss functions are here determined using known (or quantifiable) physical relations between critical dimensions and quality aspects of interest. Here, only parameters (in this case dimensions) that have {{a major influence on}} an important quality aspect of a product are studied. Functionality loss caused by a critical dimension may, for example, be the maintenance cost related to the life of a component, or the operating cost related to the efficiency of a component. A minimum manufacturing cost curve is used to describe the minimum manufacturing cost for every <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> a critical <b>dimension.</b> This curve represents the manufacturing cost on a competitive market, and the price of a product is assumed to be a function of the minimum manufacturing cost. The total loss to customer is here defined as the total potential cost, due to the choice <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> a product will cause the user over a certain period of time. The total loss is defined as the sum of the functionality loss and the tolerance-dependent part of the product price. The optimal <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> a critical <b>dimension</b> is the one representing the minimum total loss for the customer. If the functionality loss is asymmetrical with respect to the functional target, a manufacturing target that deviates slightly from the functional target may allow somewhat looser manufacturing tolerances without compromising the function of the product. This may result in lower manufacturing cost and may also increase the robustness to the design. The optimal combination of nominal value (manufacturing target) and tolerance is again the one that minimizes the total loss to customer. A worst case approach is used throughout this work to determine the total tolerance-dependent loss to customer that may occur. The implementation of the method in an integrated CAD/CAM system is discussed and a prototype system is developed. The prototype system allows the designer to graphically define tolerance chains on the drawing. Tolerances in a tolerance chain may then be determined using cost minimization or by cost/loss optimization...|$|R

40|$|Tolerance charting, as a {{practical}} tool to determine nominal working dimensions and their tolerances for the process operations of a product, {{has been used in}} manufacturing industry for many decades. In the past years, many researchers have made great efforts on the tolerance charts for products with square-shouldered features (that is, 1 D tolerance charting) and a few researchers have discussed tolerance charts for products with angular features, which are more complicated than the former.

In order to illuminate a single antenna, and use CloudSat-like quasi-optical transmission lines, a spatial diplexer is needed to add the Ka-band channel. A dichroic filter separates Ka-band from W-band by employing advances in electrical discharge machining (EDM) and mode-matching analysis techniques developed and validated for designing dichroics for the Deep Space Network (DSN), to develop a preliminary design that both met the requirements of frequency separation and mechanical strength. First, a mechanical prototype was built using an approximately 102 -micron-diameter EDM process, and <b>tolerances</b> <b>of</b> the hole <b>dimensions,</b> wall thickness, radius, and dichroic filter thickness measured. The prototype validated the manufacturing needed to design a dichroic filter for a higher-frequency usage than previously used in the DSN.
