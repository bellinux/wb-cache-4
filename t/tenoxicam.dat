50|$|<b>Tenoxicam</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It was originated by Roche {{but as of}} 2008 is sold by Meda AB {{under the}} trade name Mobiflex. It is available as a prescription-only drug in the United Kingdom and other countries, {{but not in the}} US. Outside of the United Kingdom, <b>tenoxicam</b> is also marketed under brand names including Tilatil, Tilcitin, and Alganex. <b>Tenoxicam</b> belongs to the class of NSAIDs known as oxicams.

5000|$|The {{most common}} SNP epoxygenase {{variants}} are as follows. 1) CYP2C8*3 (30411A>G, rs10509681, Lys399Arg) converts arachidonic acid to 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET with a turnover rate {{less than half}} that of wild type CYP2C8; in a single recent report, male but not female carriers of the CYP2C8*3 allele had an increased risk of essential hypertension. Bearers of this SNP may or may not show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are its substrates such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, <b>tenoxicam,</b> and valdecoxib. 2) CYP2J2*7 (−76G>T, rs890293, upstream Promoter (genetics) site) has decreased binding of the Sp1 transcription factor resulting in its lowered expressionas and lowered levels of EETs in plasma. Carriers of this SNP among a Uygur population in China had a higher risk of coronary artery disease. However, CYP2J2*7 carriers showed no association with hypertension, heart attack, or stroke in a study of 5,740 participants of the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study; since other studies have afforded contradictory results, this allele is currently regarded as not associated with cardiovascular diseases (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance). [...] Bearers of this SNP in a Chinese Population had a higher risk of younger onset of type 2 diabetes and among a Chinese Han population had a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. 3) CYP2C8*2 (11054A>T, rs11572103, Ile269Phe) and CYP2C8*4 (11041C>, rs1058930, variants have reduced arachidonic acid-metabolizing activity but have not been clearly associated with cardiovascular or other diseases. 4) CYPC28*4 (3608C>T, rs1058930, Ile264Met) has reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. It has not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but has a higher incidence in subjects with type II diabetes in a small sample of Caucasians in Germany. [...] 5) The CYP2C9*2 (3608C>T, rs1799853, Arg144Cys) variant has a 50% reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolizing activity compared to CYP2C9 wild type carriers of it show no association with cardiovascular disease but exhibit poor metabolism of the anti-coagulating, blood-thining agent, warfarin. These carriers are susceptible to the gastrointestinal bleeding side effects of warfarin and the NSAID cited above. 6 [...] ) CYP2C9*3 (42624A>C, rs1057910, Iso359Leu) encodes an expoxygenase with reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. This allele has not been directly associated with cardiovascular diseases but may be associated with the poor metabolism and therefore adverse reactions to warfarin, NSAID, sulfonylurea-containing oral hypoglycemic agents, and the anti-(epilepsy) drug, phenytoin. 7) CYP2C19*2 (19154G>A, rs4244285, Il264Met) and CYP2C19*3 (17948G>A, rs4986893, His212X) are loss-of-function null alleles; carriers of the CYP2C19*3 but not the CYP2C19*2 allele showed a reduced risk of developing essential hypertension in a large Korean population study. Bearers of null alleles would be expected to be poor metabolizers of several drugs which are CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 substrates. This is particularly the case with Clopidogrel, a drug used to block platelet activation, blood clotting, and thereby heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery occlusion in people at high risk of these events; CYP2C19 metabolizes clopidogrel to it active form. Consequently, patients with severe deficiencies in this CYP, i.e. bearers of CYP2C19*3 or CYP2C19*2 alleles, fail to gain protection from clopidogrel and have a higher risk of the cited cardiovascular events than clopidogrel-treated patients bearing wild type CYP2C19 alleles. 8) CYPC19*17 (-800C>T, rs12248560, site upstream gene promoter site) causes overproduction of its epoxygenase and thereby the ultra fast metabolism of arachidonic acid. Bearers of this allele have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but clearly show a decreased risk of developing breast cancer and endometriosis possible because their rapid metabolism of estrogen leads to lower estrogen levels and thereby a lower risk of these estrogen-fueled diseases. These bearers also a higher rate of metabolism of, and therefore reduced responsiveness to, certain proton pump inhibitor and antidepressant drugs.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Tenoxicam</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) licensed for use in rheumatic {{disease and}} other musculoskeletal disorders in the UK, and is widely available in other countries worldwide. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral <b>tenoxicam</b> in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study {{has been used for}} many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties. Objectives: To assess the efficacy of single dose oral <b>tenoxicam</b> in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events. Search strategy: We searched The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (March 2009); EMBASE via Ovid (March 2009); the Oxford Pain Relief Database. Selection criteria: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral <b>tenoxicam</b> for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The area under the "pain relief versus time" curve was used to derive the proportion of participants with <b>tenoxicam</b> experiencing least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) was calculated using 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period, and time to use of rescue analgesia, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was also collected. Main results: Not one of sixteen studies identified by the searches and examined in detail studied oral <b>tenoxicam</b> in patients with established postoperative pain and therefore no results are available. Authors' conclusions: In the absence of evidence of efficacy for oral <b>tenoxicam</b> in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified at present. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes which are effective, there is no urgent research agenda for this particular drug. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

40|$|International audienceTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>tenoxicam,</b> a multicentre prospective trial was conducted by 1102 physicians in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama and the Republic of Dominica. The approved indications in this trial included Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic conditions. The patients received <b>tenoxicam</b> 20 mg/day for 2 to 4 weeks. A favourable clinical response was obtained in 92. 3 % of 4231 patients, and satisfactory tolerance was obtained in 95. 8 % of patients. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal (7. 02 %) and, less frequently, neurological and skin disorders. The incidence of side effects was significantly higher in females. There was no correlation between the risk of adverse reactions and age. Discontinuation of therapy because of adverse reactions occurred in 1. 04 % of patients. Thus, <b>tenoxicam</b> possesses {{a high degree of}} efficacy and good tolerability in the treatment of rheumatic disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to assess the efficiency of <b>Tenoxicam</b> epidural administration, and represent pathophysiological substantiation of new techniques of dorsalgias treatment. Materials and methods. There have been examined 75 patients with intense lumbar pain syndrome who underwent epidural pharmacotherapy of pain syndrome. The 1 st group (n= 50) had epidural <b>Tenoxicam</b> introduction, by 20 mg in 10 – 20 ml of saline solution, the control group (n= 25) was given the combination of corticosteroids and local anesthetics. The pain syndrome dynamics {{in the process of}} treatment was assessed using visual-analog scale and qualitative and quantitative method of pain syndrome assessment. Results. The concept of degenerative cascade in dorsalgia pathogenesis has been represented. Short- and long-term treatment results of intense lumbar pain syndrome by <b>Tenoxicam</b> epidural introduction have shown its efficiency. Compared to the use of combination of local anesthetics and glucocorticosteroids, the present method reduces the period of treatment of patients with dorsalgias, and contributes to marked regress of pain syndrome and prolonged remissions...|$|E
40|$|Two nonsteroid {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs, Piroxicam and <b>Tenoxicam,</b> {{are shown}} to be strongly adsorbed on mercury electrodes. Using this phenomenon to accumulate these compounds at the static mercury-drop electrode prior to square-wave voltammetric measurement, sub-nanomole sensitivities are readily achieved. A preconcentration potential of - 0. 6 V vs. Ag/AgCl/KCl(s) was used for both drugs. The adsorptive stripping response was evaluated with respect to accumulation time and potential, analyte concentration, and electrolyte nature and concentration. Ascorbic acid up to 1 × 10 - 4 M {{has no effect on}} the Piroxicam peak, but results in enhanced response for the <b>Tenoxicam</b> adsorptive stripping peak. Studies were performed at pH 4. 0 and 2. 0 for the two drugs; at these values two and four electrons are transferred, respectively. The detection limit was 7 × 10 - 10 M for Piroxicam and 1 × 10 - 10 M for <b>Tenoxicam,</b> the latter being even more sensitive (5 × 10 - 11 M) in the presence of ascorbic acid. Applicability of square wave voltammetry to urine samples was demonstrated. The detection limit is 5 × 10 - 8 M and 5 × 10 - 9 M (in presence of 1 × 10 - 5 M ascorbic acid) for Piroxicam and <b>Tenoxicam,</b> respectively, in urine samples diluted ten-fold with the supporting electrolyte. © 1990, The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, crystal {{engineering}} and spray drying approaches {{are applied to}} <b>tenoxicam</b> Form III, a sparingly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) (3 ̆c 0. 1 ug/ml aqueous solubility) within the oxicam class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). The primary objectives {{of the study were}} to investigate the feasibility of applying crystal engineering and spray drying techniques to identify and characterize cocrystals, and generate a stabilized amorphous dispersions of <b>tenoxicam</b> respectively; and determine whether or not the identified cocrystals or generated amorphous dispersions have impact, if any, on the solubility and/or dissolution and stability of a sparingly soluble model drug, <b>tenoxicam.</b> ^ An attempt was made to summarize the relevant widespread current literature to understanding the design strategy of cocrystals, preparation techniques and their limitations, cocrystal formation pathways, crystal engineering strategies evaluation and the potential impact of these strategies on the physicochemical properties of an API in question. Recent advances made in the crystal engineering strategies and the innumerable possibilities for designing cocrystals of pharmaceutical and clinical relevance have been exemplified by several cocrystal case studies. ^ <b>Tenoxicam</b> is a molecule that contains a number of groups capable of hydrogen bonding including amide, pyridyl, phenolic hydroxyl, sulfone, and thiophene functional groups. Therefore, the evaluation of cocrystal design strategy in this study included various carboxylic acids as cocrystal formers representing a wide range of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Cocrystals of <b>tenoxicam,</b> were screened, prepared, and characterized using various techniques. Nine phase pure cocrystals of <b>tenoxicam</b> were identified using solvent-drop grinding (SDG) techniques. Structural characterization was performed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry, and multinuclear solid-state NMR (SSNMR). Solvates and phase mixtures encountered in SDG cocrystal screening were detected using Thermal analysis, PXRD, and 1 D SSNMR techniques. Cocrystals formation was confirmed and the structural aspects for the selected cocrystals formed with saccharin, salicylic acid, succinic acid, and glycolic acid are determined using 2 D SSNMR methods. Molecular association was demonstrated using cross-polarization heteronuclear dipolar correlation (CP-HETCOR) methods involving 1 H and 13 C nuclei. The local aspects of the cocrystal structure were revealed by Short-range 1 H- 13 C CP-HETCOR and 1 H- 1 H double-quantum interactions between atoms of interest, including those engaged in hydrogen bonding. The ionization state and the potential for zwitterionization in the selected cocrystals were assessed by 15 N SSNMR. The <b>tenoxicam</b> saccharin cocrystal was found to be similar in structure to a previously-reported cocrystal of piroxicam and saccharin. Comparative evaluation studies on dissolution for four selected cocrystals yielded intrinsic dissolution rates similar or reduced relative to <b>tenoxicam</b> Form III. ^ Amorphous spray dried dispersions were prepared using L-arginine as a solubilizer. The physical properties of these dispersions were improved by adding Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizer. Results of the study indicated that dispersions containing a 1 : 2 ratio of tenoxicam:L-arginine with 10...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} oral and i. v. <b>tenoxicam</b> on postoperative pain after unilateral total knee replacement in a double-blind, randomized, controlled study. <b>Tenoxicam</b> was administered to two groups of patients, either before (40 mg orally) or after (40 mg i. v.) surgery, then at 24 h after surgery (40 mg i. v.) {{and at the end}} of each day for 8 days (20 mg orally). A third group were given placebo at all times. All patients had access to PCA morphine for the first 48 h and then co-dydramol tablets for the duration of the study. We studied 101 patients, mean age 67 yr. There was no significant reduction in the requirement for PCA morphine for the duration of the study in either of the treatment groups, or for co-dydramol in the first 2 days, but <b>tenoxicam</b> significantly reduced the need for co-dydramol over the remaining 7 days.

40|$|The {{effects of}} piroxicam, <b>tenoxicam,</b> {{diclofenac}} sodium, acetylsalicylic acid and tiaprofenic acid on the chemotaxis and random migration of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were investigated, using zymosan-activated serum as chemo-attractant, with a modified Boyden chamber technique. All five compounds significantly reduced chemotaxis. The random migration of polymor-phonuclear leukocytes was inhibited by piroxicam, diclofenac sodium and tiaprofenic acid {{but not by}} <b>tenoxicam</b> or acetylsalicylic acid. The inhibitory effect of these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on polymor-phonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and on random migration was generally dose-dependent. The {{results suggest that the}} drugs studied may have a direct effect on polymor-phonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and that this activity may contribute to their anti-inflammatory properties...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tenoxicam</b> and {{diclofenac}} sodium {{were compared with}} each other for analgesic efficacy following removal of third molars under general anesthesia. Thirty-five healthy patients between the ages of 18 and 28 yr were randomly allocated to two groups to participate in this study. Patients in Group A (n = 17) received a single intravenous injection of <b>tenoxicam</b> 40 mg at induction of anesthesia, followed by a 20 -mg tablet given in the evening of the day of the operation and thereafter, one 20 -mg tablet daily from days 2 to 7. Group B (n = 18) received a single intramuscular injection of {{diclofenac sodium}} 75 mg at induction of anesthesia, followed by a 50 -mg tablet 4 to 6 hr after the operation and again, between 2100 hr and 2200 hr the same day. Thereafter, a 50 -mg tablet was taken 3 times daily for the next 6 days. Pain was measured hourly for the first 4 hr postoperatively, then at 21 hr, and thereafter in the morning and the evenings on days 2 to 7. The highest pain scores were obtained 1 hr postoperatively for both trial groups. At 1 and 2 hr postoperatively, no statistical significant differences in pain scores could be shown for both groups. However, at 3 and 4 hr postoperatively, patients in the <b>tenoxicam</b> group experienced significantly (P < or = 0. 05) less pain than those in the diclofenac sodium group. On the evening of the third postoperative day, the <b>tenoxicam</b> group of patients experienced significantly less pain (P < or = 0. 05) than those in the diclofenac sodium group. This was again the case {{on the morning of the}} fourth postoperative day.

This was a randomized controlled double-blind cross-over study. The patients were divided into three groups. Two groups received <b>tenoxicam</b> in daily doses of 20 mg orally for 3 days. Group A received the first dose of the drug before orthodontic activation and group B, just afterwards. Group C (control) received a placebo for 3 days. All groups had access to 750 mg of paracetamol up to four times a day. Three orthodontic activations were performed at 30 -day intervals. Each patient belonged to two different groups. Pain intensity was assessed using a descriptive Pain Scale and a Visual Analog Scale. Private clinic; 36 patients undergoing bilateral canine tooth retraction. The statistical analysis did not show any difference in movement between the active groups and the control at any time. There was no statistical difference between the groups that received <b>tenoxicam.</b> Pain intensity in these groups was lower than in the placebo group. The difference in pain intensity between the active groups and the control was greatest at the assessment made 12 h after activation and it tended to zero, 72 h after activation. <b>Tenoxicam</b> did not influence orthodontic movement of the upper canines. It was effective for pain control and did not present any preemptive analgesic effect. FAPESP - Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paul...|$|E
