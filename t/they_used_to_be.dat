5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> grown {{with mixed results}} from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as {{the shape of the}} spines. Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E

In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E

5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E
5|$|In peacetime, the {{commander}} of the land forces is the minister of defense, while in wartime, the President of Romania becomes the supreme commander of the armed forces. The main combat formations of Romania are the 2nd Infantry Division Getica, and the 4th Infantry Division Gemina. Until 2015 the Romanian land forces fielded a third division, namely the 1st Division Dacia. Before June 2008, the 1st and 4th divisions were known as the 1st Territorial Army Corps and the 4th Territorial Army Corps and in turn <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called the 1st Army and 4th Army prior to 2000. However due to their personnel having been reduced considerably in order to reach compatibility with NATO standards they were renamed and reorganized as divisions. In 2010, the Joint HQ command was renamed as 2nd Infantry Division Getica and received units from the 1st and the 4th Infantry divisions.|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

Data used and produced in such projects and experiments become increasingly complex and heterogeneous.

The DOE Scientific Data Management (SDM) initiative aims to develop a framework that helps scientists to manage data in distributed and collaborative environments. It also provides tools that help them create and manage scientific workflows that use network-based (web) services, agent technologies and semantic mediation techniques. The current SDM’s framework is known as SPA/Kepler and is Ptolemy II based. One of the vulnerabilities of service dependent workflows is that they require that the web services <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available whenever the workflow is run.
