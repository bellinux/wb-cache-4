40|$|Dollarization'' can {{be defined}} as the {{fraction}} of a country's <b>total</b> <b>currency</b> that is held in the form of U. S. dollars. Based on this definition, the Russian economy seems dollarized to a large extent. Anecdotal evidence indicates that dollar bills are widely used, not just as a store of wealth but also for transactions purposes, even though the latter is illegal. The ratio of dollars to <b>total</b> <b>currency</b> in Russia quickly increased from almost zero in January 1992 to over 70 % today. According to some estimates, Russia now has the second largest volume of U. S. dollars circulating in cash, after the United States itself. Existing models of currency substitution predicti that the dollarization ratio in a country should increase with exchange rate depreciation or the interest rate differential. However, the experience with dollarization in many Latin American countries has shown that, while dollarization often does increase with such variables, reductions in these variables typically do not induce de-dollarization, or at least have a much smaller, asymmetric effect. This phenomenon has been referred to as ''dollarization hysteresis''. The main hypothesis of this paper is that dollarization hysteresis exists in Russia as well, and that it is caused by network externalities in the demand for money. Network externalities arise {{from the fact that the}} demand for a given currency depends on the currency in which one is paid, as well as on the extent to which this currency is accepted by others as a means of payment. In the theoretical part of the paper, we show that network externalities can indeed be a cause of dollarization hysteresis. In the empirical part of the paper, we then test whether dollarization hysteresis in fact exists in Russia, i. e. whether the rate of exchange rate depreciation and the interest rate differential have asymmetric effects on the dollarization ratio. ...|$|R
30|$|The <b>total</b> <b>currency</b> {{turnover}} in global financial markets has dramatically increased {{since the end}} of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970 s. In fact, progressive financial innovation and deregulation have induced foreign exchange trading to exceed, by almost 20 -fold, the volume of goods and services worldwide. 1 According to Jongen et al. (2008), “It therefore seems that the foreign exchange market is a market ‘on its own’ and that this market, because of its large volume, is highly liquid and efficient.” 2 As such, there has been a longstanding debate in the international finance literature on the main factors driving these capital flows. Nonetheless, most of the works agree that expectations play a central role in the determination of the exchange rate and for some authors, little else matters (see Woodford and Walsh (2005)).|$|R

This trend worsened with the outbreak of the Chinese Civil war in 1946.

To accomplish this task, we develop and estimate an empirical model of exchange rate dynamics using daily data for four currencies {{relative to the}} US dollar: the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen. The model includes (i) normal shocks with stochastic variance, (ii) jumps {{up and down in}} the exchange rate, and (iii) jumps in the variance. We identify these components using data on exchange rates and at-the-money implied variances. We find that crash risk is time-varying. The probability of an upward (downward) jump in the exchange rate, associated with depreciation (appreciation) of the US dollar, is increasing in the domestic (foreign) interest rate. The probability of a jump in variance is increasing in the variance but is not related to interest rates. Many of the jumps in exchange rates are associated with macroeconomic and political news, but jumps in variance are not. On average, jumps account for 25 % of <b>total</b> <b>currency</b> risk (and can be as high as 40 %), as measured by the entropy of exchange rate changes, over horizons of one to three months.

40|$|During the 12 {{years since}} 1992 when {{people started to}} use the dollar as a {{currency}} in Cambodia, {{the share of the}} dollar has reached more than 70 % of the <b>total</b> <b>currency.</b> This dollarization phenomenon has resulted in large seigniorage losses for the Cambodian government. The costs are estimated up to US$ 682 million at the end of 2004 with an additional US$ 61 million lost annually. Furthermore, there are many other kinds of costs caused by the side effects of seigniorage loss. Without siegiorage, some monetary, fiscal and foreign trade policies are no longer available. Worsening the distortion of income distribution is another side effect. These are major costs of dollarization over the direct seigniorage loss. The benefits of dollarization include stabilizing price levels and lowering the risk of national default during a foreign currency crisis. It is not difficult to conclude that the costs of dollarization outweigh the benefits. There are two de-dollarization methods. One is a policy that prohibits people from using the dollar as a currency by law. The other is the policy that widens the difference of the costs and the benefits of using dollars, also by law. Either method is applicable but it seems reasonable that the method of prohibition by direct law would be more effective and efficient than the other method, since 84 % of the total population exclusively uses the riel in Cambodia. It is totally dependent on the decision of the Cambodian government whether or not a de-dollarization policy is adopted. The results of the decision, for good or ill, will rest finally with the people of Cambodia.

40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} {{currency in}} circulation in the euro area {{since the beginning of}} the 1980 s. After a comprehensive literature review on this topic we present some stylised facts on currency holdings in the euro area countries as well as at an aggregate euro area level. The next chapter develops a theoretical model, which extends traditional money demand models to also incorporate arguments for the informal economy and foreign demand for specific currencies. In the empirical sections we first estimate the demand for euro legacy <b>currencies</b> in <b>total</b> and for small and large denominations within a cointegration framework. We find significant differences between the determinants of holdings of small and large denominations as well as overall currency demand. While small-value banknotes are mainly driven by domestic transactions, the demand for large-value banknotes depends on a short-term interest rate, the exchange rate of the euro as a proxy for foreign demand and inflation variability. Large-value banknotes seem to be therefore used to an important extent as a store of value domestically and abroad. As monetary policy is mainly interested in getting information on the demand for currency used for domestic transactions we also try several approaches in this direction. All the methods applied result in rather low levels of transaction balances used within the euro area of around 25 % to 35 % of <b>total</b> <b>currency.</b> After this we deal with possibly changing cost-benefit-considerations of the use of cash due to the introduction of euro notes and coins.

40|$|Studies on the {{stability}} of money demand or money supply functions have received prominent attention in the literature.

Stability in money supply or money demand is also important to ensure price stability, as one of the key areas that central banks like the Bank of Namibia (BoN) seeks to achieve. The BoN uses exchange rate targeting to achieve economic stability. It is for this reason that exchange rate is used as the key determinant of money demand in this study. The study employs various econometric tests to investigate {{the stability}} of money demand. The objective of the current study is to investigate whether money supply in Namibia is stable using two measures of money demand as adopted by the BoN. These measures are, M 1, which refers to the <b>total</b> <b>currency</b> in the hands of the public, and M 2, which includes currency plus bank deposits. The regression results show that both M 1 and M 2 have stable long-run relationships between income, interest rate, CPI and exchange rate.
