5|$|Steven Patrick Morrissey, former {{lead singer}} of <b>The</b> <b>Smiths,</b> was born here in 1959.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smiths</b> {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to <b>the</b> <b>Smiths,</b> and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the single's release, <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> {{recorded}} the song again during aborted sessions for their debut album with producer Troy Tate. This version was recorded a tone lower than the original in the key of F# minor, and features a shorter introduction. <b>The</b> <b>Smiths</b> recorded the song again with producer John Porter in October at Manchester's Pluto Studios. Morrissey rejected {{this version of the}} song. Due to impending deadlines, the version that ultimately appeared on the band's first album <b>The</b> <b>Smiths</b> was a remix of the original master recording from the Strawberry Studios session. For this version, Porter increased the separation between Marr's guitar tracks and Morrissey's vocals, emphasised drummer Mike Joyce's drum beat, pushed Rourke's bass back in the mix, and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to the song.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1856, <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> of Derby Group are clockmakers {{based in}} Derby, Derbyshire, UK. <b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> of Derby {{business}} has been running continuously under 5 generations of <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> family.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> College Campus School {{was founded}} in 1926 by <b>the</b> {{president}} of <b>Smith</b> College, Jim Carry who first established <b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> College Nursery School and <b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> College Day School. The school then expanded to the laundry building at Smith.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> School {{was founded}} through a benefaction from <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> Family Educational Foundation and officially opened in 2008. From 2008 to 2012 Professor Sir David King {{served as the}} {{founding}} director of <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> School.|$|R
5|$|For {{the three}} {{dangerous}} {{days of the}} passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> were the novelist Robert Liddell, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wives– <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms {{by the end of}} the voyage, but Manning had the last word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot.|$|E
5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while <b>the</b> <b>smiths</b> thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E
5|$|He {{credits his}} {{inspiration}} for learning guitar to Greg Ginn, Pat Smear,and Joe Strummer, amongst others. As an adolescent, {{he began by}} focusing upon Hendrix, as well as bands like Public Image Ltd., <b>The</b> <b>Smiths,</b> and XTC. Frusciante's other major influence was John McGeoch of Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> set and Schwartz set are {{sometimes}} confused in the literature. Miller (1977, p. 775) lists GOCHA as an alternate name for <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set, but it actually {{refers to the}} Schwartz set. The Schwartz set is actually a subset of <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set (and equal to it {{if there are no}} pairwise ties between members of <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set).|$|R
5000|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> and Wesson Model 4566TSW sidearms, the West Virginia State Police carried <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson 4566, {{unlike the}} 4566TSW's the 4566 didn't have the {{tactical}} rail. Prior to the Model 4566 [...]40 S&W Smith & Wesson Model 4006. Before <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson 4006, the West Virginia State Police carried <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson Model 686 [...]357 magnum.|$|R
50|$|Voting {{methods that}} fail <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> {{criterion}} {{can be modified}} to satisfy it (typically {{at the expense of}} other criteria). One approach is to apply the voting method to <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set only. (In other words, begin by deleting the candidates not in <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set from <b>the</b> votes.) For example, the voting method Smith/Minimax is the application of Minimax to the candidates in <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set. Another approach is to elect the member of <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set that is highest in the voting method's order of finish.|$|R
5|$|Musicians {{who have}} lived in the area include Morrissey, the front man of '80s {{alternative}} rock band <b>the</b> <b>Smiths,</b> whose family moved to King's Road in Stretford, when he was 10 years old. Jay Kay, lead singer and songwriter of Jamiroquai, was born in Stretford in 1969. Oscar Nominated Film maker Mark Gill was raised in Stretford where he recently made a film about the early life of Morrissey.|$|E
5|$|Ono later bought 'Mendips' {{and donated}} it to The National Trust. It was renovated {{to make it}} look {{as it was in the}} 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, had advised the National Trust on how the house looked when <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> lived there.|$|E
5|$|The English {{alternative}} {{rock band}} <b>The</b> <b>Smiths</b> released four studio albums, one extended play (EP), one live album, ten compilation albums, twenty singles, one video album and fourteen music videos on the Rough Trade, Sire and WEA record labels. The band {{was formed in}} 1982 in Manchester by vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bass player Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce.|$|E
25|$|Revolvers {{still remain}} popular as back-up and off-duty handguns among American law {{enforcement}} officers and security guards and are still common in the American private sector as defensive and sporting/hunting firearms. Famous police and military revolvers include the Webley, the Colt Single Action Army, the Colt Police Special, <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson Model 36, <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson Model 10, <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson 1917, <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> & Wesson Model 3, and the Nagant M1895.|$|R
50|$|Methods failing the Condorcet {{criterion}} also fail <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> criterion. Some Condorcet methods, such as Minimax, also fail <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> criterion.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> {{criterion}} implies <b>the</b> Mutual majority criterion, therefore Minimax's {{failure to}} satisfy the Mutual majority criterion is also a failure to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> criterion. Observe that the set S = {A, B, C} in the example is <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set and D is the Minimax winner.|$|R
5|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, folk rock {{changed and}} evolved away from the jangly {{template}} pioneered by The Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band's influence could still {{be heard in the}} music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, The Byrds' jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music up to the present day, with authors Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, Mark Deming, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band's influence on such acts as Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., The Long Ryders, <b>The</b> <b>Smiths,</b> The Bangles, The Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and The La's.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and was the work of <b>the</b> <b>smiths</b> James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
5|$|He is a {{good friend}} of the boxer Ricky Hatton and has {{supported}} him in some of his fights, and has trained with him. He is also a friend of former Oasis band member Noel Gallagher. Barton co-owns a race horse called 'Crying Lightning' (named after the Arctic Monkeys song) with fellow footballer Claudio Pizarro. In January 2011, the horse competed at the Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai. He is also notable for his love of Manchester band <b>The</b> <b>Smiths,</b> citing Morrissey as an idol of his.|$|E

5|$|The Bounty Hunter learns of Mulder's {{whereabouts}} {{by listening}} in on {{a phone call}} between him and a captive Scully, leaving her to pursue him and Smith. In Washington, Scully reports to Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who informs her that the other Jeremiah Smiths have all disappeared. Scully and Agent Pendrell investigate the data that <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> were compiling, trying to decipher the encrypted files. Scully contacts X, who tells her that it {{is related to the}} government's long-running smallpox eradication program. X also tells her that he believes Teena's life is in danger.|$|E
5|$|The flight {{instruments}} in the B.1 were traditional and included G4B compasses; Mk.4 artificial horizons; and zero reader flight display instruments. The B.1 had a Smiths Mk10 autopilot. In the B.2, these features were incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots' components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and a Mk.10A or Mk.10B autopilot. From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the ARI 5959 Terrain-following radar (TFR), built by General Dynamics, its commands being fed into the director-horizons.|$|E
5|$|This {{section was}} named after a song by <b>The</b> <b>Smiths.</b> The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the {{construction}} workers who had built the Olympic Park. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'. Six of the team were athletes, and the seventh was a volunteer young ambassador.|$|E

5000|$|In voting systems, <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set, {{named after}} John H. Smith, but {{also known as}} the top cycle, or as GETCHA, is the {{smallest}} non-empty set of candidates in a particular election such that each member defeats every other candidate outside the set in a pairwise election. <b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> set provides one standard of optimal choice for an election outcome. Voting systems that always elect a candidate from <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> set pass <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> criterion and are said to be [...] "Smith-efficient".|$|R

5|$|Destruction of the {{newspaper}} provoked a strident call to arms from Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal and longtime critic of Smith. Fearing an uprising, Smith mobilized the Nauvoo Legion on June 18 and declared martial law. Officials in Carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia, and Governor Thomas Ford appeared, threatening to raise a larger militia unless Smith and the Nauvoo city council surrendered themselves. Smith initially fled across the Mississippi River, but shortly returned and surrendered to Ford. On June 23, Smith and his brother Hyrum rode to Carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot. Once <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> were in custody, the charges were increased to treason.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, {{during the}} New York Draft Riots, Irish rioters {{attacked}} and burned down the orphan asylum. The children were {{saved by the}} staff and Union troops in the city. During its nearly 30 years, the orphan asylum had admitted 1310 children, and typically had about 200 in residence at a time. After the riots, Smith moved his family and business out of Manhattan, as did other prominent blacks. Numerous buildings were destroyed in their old neighborhoods, and estimates were that 100 blacks {{were killed in the}} rioting. No longer feeling safe in the lower Fourth Ward, <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} Smith's wives, Emma Hale, {{gave birth to}} nine {{children}} during their marriage, five of whom died {{before the age of}} two. The eldest, Alvin (born in 1828), died within hours of birth, as did twins Thaddeus and Louisa (born in 1831). When the twins died, <b>the</b> <b>Smiths</b> adopted another set of twins, Julia and Joseph, whose mother had recently died in childbirth; Joseph died of measles in 1832. In 1841, Don Carlos, who had been born a year earlier, died of malaria. In 1842, Emma gave birth to a stillborn son. Joseph and Emma had four sons who lived to maturity: Joseph Smith III, Frederick Granger Williams Smith, Alexander Hale Smith, and David Hyrum Smith.|$|E
