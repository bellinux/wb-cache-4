The Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) reviewed <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> from both the FIBT and the FIL to fine tune the track. Canadian teams continued testing and training at the track until 20 March 2008. A total of 2155 runs (335 bobsleigh, 1077 luge, and 743 skeleton) {{took place at the}} track with a total of 15 crashes. Final track inspection by the FIL Executive Board took place 25–27 September 2008 before the International Training Week later that year.|$|E

The rationale was that the task of converting VR from broad to standard gauge at a future date would be far easier to achieve if the existing locomotives and rolling stock could be easily modified for standard gauge operation, rather than requiring expensive re-engineering or replacement.|$|E
25|$|The Bahraini government's {{decision}} {{to establish an}} independent inquiry to investigate the unrest won praise from many western governments, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as human rights organisations such as Amnesty International.

A nine-year member of the Katanning Road Board and an unsuccessful candidate at the 1933 election, Watts opened his campaign on Monday, 19 August, at the Katanning Town Hall. He supported the lowering of tariffs, statutory opposition to rises in interest rates, and {{the extension of the}} co-operative system, as well as prompt implementation of <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> by the Royal Commission on bulk handling. Watts opposed nationalising banking, and was critical of the state government's attempts to reduce unemployment and the federal government's implementation of the Debt Adjustment Act, both of which he considered unsuccessful.|$|E

Four of the Caribbean teams, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, come from individual countries while two teams, the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands, which previously competed together as the Combined Islands, are each from multiple countries and territories. Beginning with the 2007–08 season the Combined Campuses and Colleges cricket team (CCC cricket team) {{were included in}} the competition, but in July 2014 the WICB announced that the CCC cricket team was to be excluded from the upcoming 2014-15 Regional Four Day competition as part of a series of changes adopted based on <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> in a report presented by Richard Pybus, WICB's director of cricket, in March 2014.|$|E
25|$|The ERT {{was found}} to be {{justified}} in shooting Delbert Kenneth Pelletier at the Muskowekwan First Nation in Melville, Saskatchewan. ERT was deployed to the area on November 13, 2006 due to reports of Pelletier being armed with a gun while acting irrational and suicidal. Pelletier's wife fled the residence prior to police arrival. Pelletier was shot by police snipers shortly after Pelletier shot at a police vehicle, striking the door but not injuring any of the officers inside. Among <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> after the inquiry include cultural relations training, including the presence of an elder's program at the RCMP Depot before ERTs would be officially deployed. Bob Hrycan, a lawyer for Calvin and Fisher Pelletier, accuses the RCMP of conducting excessive force. The Pelletier family has made calls for a wider probe into the shooting death of Delbert Pelletier.|$|E

25|$|Between 1960 and 1970, {{development}} of the Georgetown waterfront was studied five times. But none of <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> by these studies were acted upon. Many D.C. residents, including those in Georgetown, strongly opposed {{plans to build a}} series of superhighways throughout the city — including along the Potomac River on the Georgetown waterfront. Each of the five different studies proposed the construction of superhighways in and around the area, and each time the controversy surrounding the recommendation made the study politically unpalatable. A sixth study was made in 1970. Commissioned by the National Capitol Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Georgetown Citizens' Association (GCA), the report made no recommendation to build a superhighway. Instead, it called for the demolition of the existing Whitehurst Freeway. The study's authors said the freeway blocked vistas, inhibited {{development of}} the waterfront, was poorly engineered, and caused traffic back-ups at both of its ends. The report urged the city to bury the freeway in an enclosed trench and sell the air rights above it to developers or use it as parkland.|$|E
25|$|A third update was {{published}} on 10 March 2016. This Special Bulletin covered the organisation of the airshow at Shoreham, and airshows in the United Kingdom in general, with {{particular attention to}} risk management. Comparison was made with how airshows are organised in Australia, Canada and the United States. British civil and military rules were examined separately. It was reported that at the 2014 Shoreham Airshow, G-BXFI had overflown Lancing with a bank angle in excess of 90°. The pilot had not been instructed to stop his display. The AAIB did not name the pilot of G-BXFI who flew the 2014 display. It was also reported that the Flying Display Director at both displays did not have prior knowledge of the display intended to be flown. The issue of low flying during air displays was investigated. A previous accident involving glider BGA 4665 at an air race in Leicestershire in August 2005 had resulted in a recommendation to the CAA to change a rule. This had not been done and new rules subsequently introduced {{had the effect of}} leaving that rule unchanged, despite the CAA agreeing with the recommendation to change it. It was noted that the police had no powers to prevent people from watching an airshow from outside the boundaries of the venue where it was taking place. In the case of Shoreham, neither Sussex Constabulary nor the organisers had asked for such powers. Signs had been put out stating that viewing was prohibited and that offenders may be prosecuted. Another issue considered was how often CAA Flight Standards Officers attended airshows: only 1.4% of airshows in 2014 and 7.1% of airshows in 2015 had been attended. Fourteen recommendations were made. In January 2017, the CAA stated that it accepted all <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> by the AAIB.|$|E

500|$|The {{properties}} of mercury {{make it an}} effective fungicide. However, in Europe and America, its health risks (even when consumed in small quantities) were known. Methylmercury had been banned in Sweden in 1966, the first country to do so, and the United Kingdom followed in 1971. Previous mercury-poisoning incidents had occurred in Iraq in 1956 and 1960. In 1956, there had been around 200 cases, and 70 deaths; in 1960 there had been 1000 cases and 200 deaths, in both cases due to ethylmercury compounds. Among <b>the</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> after the 1960 incident had been to colour any toxic grain for easy identification. Before the 1971 incident, around 200–300 cases of methylmercury poisoning had been reported worldwide. [...] Drought had reduced harvests in 1969, affecting 500,000 people, and in 1970. Saddam Hussein, as the government's no. 2 behind Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, decided to import mercury-coated seed grain for the late 1971 planting season. Hussein himself may have worked in the Department of Agriculture {{in the aftermath of}} the 1960 incident.|$|E
