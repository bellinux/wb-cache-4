They’re having a collective experience in which <b>they</b> <b>literally</b> bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E

25|$|The {{degradation}} of polymers to form smaller molecules may proceed by random scission or specific scission. The {{degradation of}} polyethylene occurs by random scission—a random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer together. When heated above 450°C, polyethylene degrades to form a mixture of hydrocarbons. Other polymers, such as poly(alpha-methylstyrene), undergo specific chain scission with breakage occurring only at the ends. <b>They</b> <b>literally</b> unzip or depolymerize back to the constituent monomer.|$|E
25|$|Few {{could have}} {{expected}} the Cinderella season the Cats {{would have in}} 2006. <b>They</b> <b>literally</b> went from worst to first in the SEC, winning a regular-season conference title {{for the first time}} in three decades, and being ranked as high as fourth in the country by one major baseball poll during the season. However, the newly energized Kentucky baseball faithful saw the Cats crash out of the SEC tournament early and fail to make it out of the regionals of the NCAA tournament at home.|$|E
25|$|Water boards (waterschap and hoogheemraadschap, pl. waterschappen and hoogheemraadschappen) {{are among}} the oldest {{government}} authorities in the Netherlands. <b>They</b> <b>literally</b> form {{the foundation of the}} whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what {{led to the creation of}} water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (college van dijkgraaf en heemraden) consisting of a chairperson (dijkgraaf) and other members ((hoog)heemraad, pl. (hoog)heemraden). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, voters do not usually have to go to a polling station but can vote by mail.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1981, Gibson's stories {{appeared}} in Omni and Universe 11, wherein his fiction developed a bleak, film noir feel. He consciously distanced himself {{as far as}} possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt [...] "an aesthetic revulsion", expressed in [...] "The Gernsback Continuum"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become [...] "a minor cult figure, a sort of lesser Ballard." [...] When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that [...] "people were just genuinely baffled...

500|$|Nala's {{role and}} {{demeanor}} during the film's romantic [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] sequence has drawn criticism {{in regards to}} her [...] "submissive behaviour". The New York Times Janet Maslin cited the film's lack of a strong heroine among its weaknesses, dismissing Nala and Simba's interaction throughout [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] as [...] "obligatory" [...] and [...] "gratuitous". Joel W. Martin wrote in the Journal of Religion and Film, [...] "One song later, [...] have fallen in love. Playing one day, <b>they</b> <b>literally</b> tumble down a hillside in the jungle, and he ends {{up on top of}} her. This time, she does not bear her teeth, but instead, shows 'bedroom eyes'". Martin ultimately accused the scene's [...] "reversal of positions" [...] of [...] "establish male dominance." [...] Criticizing the film for [...] "being merely distracting when it could have been both meaningful and instructive", Robert Humanick of Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Small potatoes, then, when Simba's former childhood friend and betrothed queen Nala ... unexpectedly reappears in his duty-free, protein-rich life, demanding he return to his kingly responsibilities and coaxing the lion to sleep tonight with arguably the most blatant 'fuck me now' face to ever appear in a PG-rated film." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{this period}} quarterback Charlie Conerly emerged. Conerly was the team's {{starting}} quarterback from 1948 to 1960, {{and had a}} franchise-record string of 12 consecutive seasons in which he led the team in passing. A former US Marine, Conerly was renowned among his teammates for his toughness. [...] "There was a time my rookie year when I really saw it", recalled running back Frank Gifford. [...] "He broke his nose really badly, <b>they</b> <b>literally</b> called a timeout and then they called another one while they stopped the bleeding, they stuck stuff up there until it would stop bleeding. You {{try to get them}} to do that today. They'd be yelling, 'Get my agent!'". In 1951, the Giants finished 9–2–1, but their inability to beat division rival Cleveland cost them an opportunity to play in the Championship Game. Fullback Eddie Price led the league in rushing and set a league record for rushing attempts in a season, and defensive linemen Arnie Weinmeister and Al Derogatis, linebacker Jon Baker, and offensive tackle Tex Coulter all made the All-Pro team. The following year New York fell to 7–5, but Tunnell continued to impress. [...] "Tunnell returned interceptions, punts, and kickoffs with such electric flair that he actually outgained the league rushing leader in yards gained" [...] according to one publication. Tunnell amassed 924yards, while never lining up on offense, whereas the league rushing leader totalled 894. The Giants offense struggled in 1953, and they fell to a 3–9 record. Gifford was forced to play both ways due to a depleted roster, and in the second to last game of the season they lost 62–14 to division rival Cleveland.|$|E

2500|$|Multiple minor Star Wars {{characters}} were given additional treatment within the game, {{and one was}} entirely new to the franchise. Arden Lyn and Jodo Kast both had only minor roles in the then Expanded Universe. Lyn was given a primary role in the game, while Kast began life as an alternate costume for Boba Fett before later becoming a unique character. Gammorean guard Thok had previously had a film appearance within Jabba's palace in [...] Hoar was an entirely new character created for the game. He was later given additional backstory, including ties to characters in [...] and the video game [...] In an interview with Destructoid, Capcom's Seth Killian mentioned that Star Gladiator was originally pitched as a Star Wars fighting game. Ultimately the pitch did not succeed and LucasArts instead developed Masters of Teräs Käsi. To promote the game, Star Wars: The Official Magazine ran a contest in June 1998 in which a black PlayStation console with the Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi logo on the top was given out. [...] "Teräs Käsi" [...] refers to a martial art used in the game; both words have been borrowed from Finnish and <b>they</b> <b>literally</b> mean [...] "steel hand".|$|E

[...] "Dan Swanö helped record this epic piece", said John Chedsey of Satan Stole My Teddybear in his review, and also mentioned that [...] "generally the songs flow well from one part to the next, though individual songs are not immediately noticeable. The twin guitars work well with each other, creating some great melodies in the guitars, and often lasping into very tasteful acoustic moods. In my opinion, it's difficult to write on guitar intricate songs that fully involve the listener, but Opeth manages to keep your attention." [...] Murat Batmaz of Sea of Tranquility wrote that [...] "the melodies, both on this song [...] and the entire album, are immortal." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Though I prefer their current lineup, I don't believe Morningrise {{would have been so}} amazing without Johan De Farfalla and Anders Nordin adding their touches. They both incorporate subtle jazz harmonies in their playing enriching the psychedelic passages on the album." [...] He was also impressed with the guitar riffs, saying [...] "it is almost shocking how many godlike riffs Opeth are using in their songs. <b>They</b> <b>literally</b> employ tens of changing riff patterns and incomparable melodies on a single track, with which other bands could more than likely write two full albums" [...] and claimed that the song [...] "Black Rose Immortal" [...] is a [...] "magnum opus".|$|E

Several years later, wanting to be closer to her sons, she returned to Los Angeles and obtained a real estate license, like her eldest sister, Kay. In 1995, she landed a small part as the [...] "Madam" [...] in Wild Bill. In 1998, she appeared as herself in the Kevin Burns TV documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes about the making of the first five Planet of the Apes films. In October 1998, Harrison attended her first science fiction convention in New Jersey. Also in attendance were Jonathan Harris, Marta Kristen, Mark Goddard and Angela Cartwright, of the original Lost in Space TV series; Lou Ferrigno of The Incredible Hulk TV series; and Bela Lugosi Jr. and Sara Karloff. Harrison found it [...] "rewarding when you really haven't done anything {{for a number of years}} and then, all of a sudden, people want your autograph. It was very gratifying." [...] Eventually, Harrison became an institution at Planet of the Apes cons. [...] "I like it. It's very good. You're being appreciated for your work." [...] In 2001, she had a cameo as the [...] "Woman in Cart" [...] in Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes. [...] "They are much more brutal in the new movie," [...] she said.
