500|$|Peter [...] "Dougal" [...] Butler {{began working}} for the Who in 1967, {{becoming}} Moon's personal assistant the following year to help him stay out of trouble. He remembers managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp saying, [...] "We <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> with Keith but {{if you ever want}} any time off, for a holiday or some sort of rest, let us know and we'll pay for it." [...] Butler never took them up on the offer.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Olivia called the single an [...] "empowering women's song" [...] for inspiring women to leave unfulfilling relationships. She said she wrote it: [...] "for {{all the people who}} don't know how to tell the other person to 'bounce' [...] ". An article in Vibe magazine noted lyrics, like: [...] "I can't take this shit no more / Picture frame broken daddy 'cause I can't <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> / I'm ridin' high now / So nigga fuck you", as creating an impression of Olivia as a [...] "potty-mouth". NMEs John Mulvey commented that Olivia's [...] "ruthlessness rather than her vocabulary" [...] was the standout, especially in the lyric: [...] "Shoulda known what you missed at home / Now you're all alone with no-one to bone". Mulvey joked that the amount of censorship on the radio edit made Olivia sound [...] "avant-garde".|$|E
500|$|The State Department {{appeared}} {{to not be}} well-informed about the action, as Ball cabled Lodge {{a few hours after}} the coup started: [...] "We have so little info on motivations and other factors involved in current crisis that we leave to your judgment how to handle. Meantime we <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> will make very clear that we {{had nothing to do with}} coup. If you consider it advisable and possible there would seem to us to be merit in preserving Minh as head of Government since he appears to have best potentialities for rallying support of people." [...] The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E

500|$|Butler {{announced}} on 6 March 1963 {{that he was}} going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> emphasised," [...] Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it." [...] No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.|$|E
500|$|As Southern Rhodesia {{had been}} the UK's {{legislative}} partner in forming the Federation in 1953, {{it would be impossible}} (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation. Field could therefore potentially hamstring the British by refusing to attend the conference until they pledged to grant his country full independence. According to Field, Smith and other RF politicians, Butler made several such guarantees orally to ensure their co-operation at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. The Southern Rhodesians claimed that Butler justified his refusal to give a written promise by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> emphasised", Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it." [...] Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, which was held at Victoria Falls over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation {{at the end of the}} year. In the House of Commons afterwards, Butler flatly denied suggestions that he had [...] "oiled the wheels" [...] of Federal dissolution with secret promises to the Southern Rhodesians.|$|E

2500|$|One man, in particular, was {{impressed}} by the young man.

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{utilitarian}} philosophers {{have supported}} lies which achieve good outcomes– white lies. In his 2008 book How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time, Iain King suggested a credible rule on lying was possible, and defined it as: [...] "Deceive {{only if you}} can change behaviour in a way worth more than the <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> would lose, were the deception discovered (whether the deception actually is exposed or not)." ...|$|E

2500|$|For fear {{of losing}} caste as a lady of quality, Stuart {{had no wish to}} see {{anything}} she had written published under her name, and it was not until 1895, more than forty years after her death, that this happened. Lockhart's Life of Scott (1837–1838) had contained several of Sir Walter Scott's letters to Stuart. In a letter to his publisher Robert Cadell, Scott writes [...] "I <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> have received the printed sheets of Lady Louisa Stuart, but for your life mention [...] her name." ...|$|E
2500|$|After an {{accidental}} meeting between Jamsedji N.

2500|$|If no {{agreement}} {{between the government and}} Solidarity had been reached, the general strike was planned for Tuesday, March 31. In between, a meeting between representatives of the NCC, headed by Wałęsa, and members of the Council of Ministers' Committee for Trade Unions, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mieczysław Rakowski took place in Warsaw, but it ended without agreement. During this meeting, a Solidarity activist from Szczecin, yelled at Rakowski: [...] "What if your wife cheats on you once, twice, three times? Will you trust her? And we do not <b>trust</b> <b>you</b> any longer".|$|E
2500|$|On Tuesday we welcomed Pulpit Minister John Dole [...] from Murray's Glendale Church of Christ.

[...] Rev. Dole [...] commented, [...] "I {{appreciate}} this opportunity. Ray had told me, 'Just come, {{do whatever you}} want to do, say whatever you want to say.

2500|$|Tritt and Stuart began a [...] "No Hats Tour" [...] in 1992. In August of {{that same}} year, Tritt {{released}} the album T-R-O-U-B-L-E. Its first single was [...] "Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man," [...] a song written by Kostas. This song, which featured backing vocals from Brooks & Dunn, T. Graham Brown, George Jones, Little Texas, Dana McVicker (who also sang backup on Tritt's first two albums), Tanya Tucker and Porter Wagoner, peaked at number four. Its follow-up, [...] "Can I <b>Trust</b> <b>You</b> with My Heart," [...] became Tritt's third Billboard number one in early 1993. The album's next three singles did not perform as well on the charts: the title track (a cover of an Elvis Presley song), peaked at 13, followed by [...] "Looking Out for Number One" [...] at number 11 and [...] "Worth Every Mile" [...] at number 30. T-R-O-U-B-L-E became the second album of his career to achieve double-platinum certification. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic thought that T-R-O-U-B-L-E followed too closely the formula of It's All About to Change, but said that the songs showed Tritt's personality. Nash gave the album a similar criticism, but praised the rock influences of [...] "Looking Out for Number One" [...] and the vocals on [...] "Can I <b>Trust</b> <b>You</b> with My Heart." ...|$|E
