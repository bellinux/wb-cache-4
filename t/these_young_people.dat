The effects of youth disconnection—limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connections—can have long-term consequences that snowball across the life course, eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to physical and mental health and marital prospects.

Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC {{eventually led to the}} formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that [...] "I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation. We have got to bring <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary." [...] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. The President was reportedly booed by the group. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders. Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons [...] "Why I still believe in the Youth Congress," [...] the American Youth Congress was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.|$|E

During a 2 -year research study into the preferences of adolescents with EBD regarding drug prevention policy, the author examined <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> opinions and their experience of participation in research. A qualitative, youth-centred method was used, combining group techniques (focus groups, nominal group techniques and feedback sessions) and involving 160 adolescents, aged 12 - 21 years, with EBD, living in residential settings of the disability sector. It is possible to carry out qualitative research with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with EBD.
