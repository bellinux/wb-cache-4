5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{a second}} ban in September 1955, Mandela went on a working holiday to <b>Transkei</b> to discuss the {{implications}} of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 with local tribal leaders, also visiting his mother and Noengland before proceeding to Cape Town. In March 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it. Mandela's marriage broke down and Evelyn left him, taking their children to live with her brother. Initiating divorce proceedings in May 1956, she claimed that Mandela had physically abused her; he denied the allegations, and fought for custody of their children. She withdrew her petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March, with the children placed in Evelyn's care. During the divorce proceedings, he began courting a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, whom he married in Bizana in June 1958. She later became involved in ANC activities, spending several weeks in prison. Together they had two children: Zenani, born in February 1959, and Zindziswa, born in December 1960.|$|E
5|$|Mandela {{obtained}} work as {{an attorney}} for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality. Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. Although a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He may have had affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to <b>Transkei,</b> while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.|$|E

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Heterodontosaurus tucki (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British-South African expedition to South Africa and Basutoland (former name of Lesotho) in 1961-1962. Today, it {{is housed in}} the Iziko South African Museum. It was excavated on a mountain {{at an altitude of}} about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of <b>Transkei</b> (sometimes referred to as Herschel) in the Cape Province of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was scientifically described and named in 1962 by palaeontologists Alfred Walter Crompton from South Africa and Alan J. Charig from the United Kingdom. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director of Austin Motor Company, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischians were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the rock matrix, was very time consuming, since they were covered in a thin, very hard, ferruginous layer containing haematite. This could only be removed by a diamond saw, which damaged the specimen.|$|E

However, when these failed, Phatudi was not above unleashing his police against political opponents.|$|R

Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult coloured citizens were eligible {{to vote for the}} Coloured Persons Representative Council, which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult Indian citizens were eligible to vote for the South African Indian Council in 1981.

40|$|Litter {{fall was}} {{measured}} in a mixed mangrove community in which Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. was dominant over Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. Mean litter production was 1. 24 g dry matter m- 2 day- 1 or 4. 51 tons ha- 1 yr- 1 over a 3 -year period. Mean annual leaf yield comprised approximately 72 % of total litter. Generally greater leaf fall occurred in the summer than in the winter. In both A. marina and B. gymnorrhiza propagule production was variable from year to year. In both species, reproductive material was present on the trees almost throughout the year. This behaviour and the low litter yields appeared {{to indicate that the}} community is approaching its southern limits. From the 14 ha of mangroves in the estuary it is calculated that total litter production is 50. 7 tons yr- 1, of which approximately 36. 8 tons yr- 1 is leaf litter. The total litter production of the larger stands of mangroves in <b>Transkei’s</b> estuaries was calculated. Mangrove litter is considered to provide a significant input to these systems...|$|R

Dalindyebo went into exile in Zambia, a move that marked the end of official opposition politics in <b>Transkei,</b> and in the 1981 election, the ruling <b>Transkei</b> National Independence Party was re-elected, gaining 100% of all open seats.|$|E

25|$|Nominally, the Republic of <b>Transkei</b> was a {{parliamentary}} democracy which {{allowed for a}} multi-party system. During its existence, six different parties registered to compete in elections at different points of its history. Until the military coup of 1987, the TNIP remained the ruling party, while the <b>Transkei</b> People's Freedom Party constituted the official opposition. Because its founder, Cromwell Diko, was {{a former member of}} the ruling party, and due to its continued support of President Matanzima's policies, there is a widely held belief that it was actually initiated by Matanzima himself to give the impression of free elections when in fact there were none. Other parties that existed never did gain any representation in parliament.|$|E
25|$|General Bantu Holomisa of the <b>Transkei</b> Defence Force {{forced the}} {{resignation}} and exile of Prime Minister George Matanzima in October 1987 and then overthrew Matanzima's successor, Prime Minister Stella Sigcau in December 1987. Holomisa became the Head of State, and the <b>Transkei</b> was {{from that point}} onwards effectively in (often uneasy) alliance with the African National Congress and provided a relatively safe area for the ANC's activities. In 1990, Holomisa himself evaded a failed attempt to be ousted from his post, and {{when asked about the}} fate of his opponents, he claimed that they had died in the ensuing battles with TDF soldiers. It was later found that those deemed responsible for the foiled coup had only suffered minor injuries, but were subsequently executed without trial.|$|E
25|$|Matanzima {{published}} Independence my Way in 1976, a book {{in which}} he argued that true liberation could only be gained through a confederation of black states; he described <b>Transkei</b> as a positive precedent and maintained that the liberation struggle chosen by the ANC would not be successful.|$|E

25|$|Conflicting data exist {{about the}} number of inhabitants. According to the South African Encyclopaedia, the total {{population}} of the <b>Transkei</b> increased from 2,487,000 to 3,005,000 between 1960 and 1970. An estimate of 1982 puts the number at about 2.3 million, with approximately 400,000 citizens residing permanently outside the territory's borders. Fewer than 10,000 individuals were of European descent, and the urbanisation-rate for the entire population was around 5%.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} war led to British defeats {{such as that}} at Qalabani, {{and ended}} in 1881 with a stalemate and a treaty that favoured the Basotho.
