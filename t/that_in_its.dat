5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the slate industry led {{to the growth of}} a number of other associated industries. Shipbuilding increased at a number of coastal locations, particularly at Porthmadog, where 201 ships were built between 1836 and 1880. Engineering companies were set up to supply the quarries, notably De Winton at Caernarfon. In 1870, De Winton built and equipped an entire workshop for the Dinorwig Quarry, with machinery powered by overhead shafting <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> turn was driven by the largest water-wheel in the United Kingdom, over 50feet in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon) is <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E
5|$|In May, the {{battalion}} moved to Balcombe on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, where they undertook range shoots, planning exercises and bivouacks. In mid-July, the 2/3rd received orders to move north to Cowra by road. Along the way, {{they stopped at}} Ingleburn, New South Wales where a draft of almost 400 reinforcements was received; {{the result of this}} was <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> second incarnation, about half {{the battalion}} came from New South Wales, instead of South Australia. The battalion remained in Cowra, where they carried out training, for ten months, eventually proceeding north to south-east Queensland in May 1943. Based around the Deception Bay area, north of Brisbane, a company was deployed to Moreton Island and another to Bribie Island. In late June, 'B' Company embarked upon the Dutch vessel, the SS Jansens and deployed to Netherlands New Guinea as part of Merauke Force, remaining there in a defensive capacity until May 1944.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1942, Gollob {{was made}} Jagdfliegerführer 3, {{responsible}} for tactical fighter command over northwestern France. Jagdfliegerführer 3 was renamed Jagdfliegerführer 5 (Jafü5—5th Fighter Pilot Leader) on 6 September 1943. In this command position, {{he was promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 20 April 1943, effective as of 1 April, and to Oberst on 1 May 1944. When he became Jafü5 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the 5. Jagd-Division (5th Fighter Division) about the suitability of the Bf109 on the Western Front. He indicated <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> present state the Bf109G-3 to G-6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw190 and Bf109 were inferior to enemy aircraft. Learning about the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-powered aircraft, Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft. Hitler had become interested in the idea of using the Me262 in a fighter-bomber role, which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for operational readiness as an interceptor.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> current circumscription, the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and colleagues and Ainsworth and colleagues, have further revealed multiple cryptic lineages within the genus. Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E

5|$|While the US1-9 Truck {{designation}} {{was first}} used in 1953, the roadway comprising the route was originally designated {{as an extension of}} pre-1927 Route 1 in 1922, a route <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> full length stretched from Trenton to Jersey City. US1-9 was designated along the road in 1926 and one year later, in 1927, this portion of pre-1927 Route 1 was replaced with Route 25 as well as with a portion of Route 1 north of the Communipaw Avenue intersection. Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US1-9 and Route 25 were realigned to the new skyway. After trucks were banned from the skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T. In 1953, US1-9 Truck was designated in favor of Route 25T and Route 1 along this segment of road. The portion of the truck route north of Route 7 is being rebuilt as part of a $271.9 million project to construct new approach roads to connect US1-9 Truck, Route 7, the Pulaski Skyway, Route 139, and US1-9 north of Tonnele Circle and local streets in Jersey City. Construction, which started in late 2008, was completed in late 2012.|$|E
