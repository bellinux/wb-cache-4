5|$|Passing through London {{en route}} to Gibraltar, where the Pangloss was based, Worsley met Shackleton, {{recently}} assigned by the War Office to the International Contingent destined for Northern Russia to aid the White movement in its fight against the Bolsheviks. Shackleton's expertise in the polar regions had been recognised by the War Office, and with the temporary rank of major, he was preparing <b>the</b> <b>contingent</b> for a winter deployment to Murmansk. Shackleton had already recruited several veterans of the Endurance to serve with him and arranged for Worsley, keen for action, {{to be transferred to}} join <b>the</b> <b>contingent.</b> Worsley, by now a lieutenant commander, left for Murmansk the following month.|$|E

5|$|Florida {{took part}} in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in 1914. She and her sister Utah were the first two ships on the scene; the two ships landed some 1,000 sailors and Marines under the command of Floridas captain on 21 April.

5|$|Machine guns: The UN {{required}} the Australians to deploy without the belt-fed M60 machine gun, the standard section-level automatic weapon at the time. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>contingent</b> {{was required to}} deploy with World War II-vintage Bren light machine guns, since these used only a 30-round magazine (the weapons had been rebuilt to accept 7.62mm ammunition).|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Islands Olympic {{delegation}} included five athletes, competing only in athletics, swimming, and weightlifting.

Between early 1993 and June 2010, 72 British military personnel died during operations in the former Yugoslavian countries of Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{dedication}} of the Shrine of Remembrance in 1934 saw a series of reunions. Ian and Edward arrived from India on leave, Alexander Godley came from Britain, and Richard Howard-Vyse {{as chief of staff}} to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. In 1937, Chauvel travelled to the United Kingdom as head of the Australian contingent for the coronation of King George VI, where he was welcomed by Chetwode and Howard-Vyse. Chauvel had <b>the</b> <b>contingent</b> dressed as light horsemen, wearing emu plumes, bandoliers and spurs. When the Dominion troops assembled at Buckingham Palace to receive their King George VI Coronation Medals, Chauvel led the parade, with Howard-Vyse as his chief of staff. On the way back, <b>the</b> <b>contingent</b> visited France, where ceremonies were held at the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial and the Arc de Triomphe. Chauvel frequently led Anzac Day parades through Melbourne but resigned from the leadership of the march in 1938 in protest against at decision by the Returned and Services League of Australia to change the form of service at the Shrine from a Christian to a secular one.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} deployment, the UN leased {{a number of}} mine-protected {{vehicles}} from the SADF. Most were Buffels, but smaller numbers of Casspir and Wolf vehicles were also leased.

5|$|Rules of Engagement: A {{major issue}} for <b>the</b> <b>contingents</b> {{concerned}} Rules of Engagement (ROE) and Orders for Opening Fire (OFOF).

5|$|Hart {{volunteered for}} the Ninth New Zealand South African Contingent, which was raised for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. By the time <b>the</b> <b>contingent</b> arrived in South Africa, the war was largely over. He saw {{extensive}} action during the First World War as a volunteer with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, first at Gallipoli {{and then on the}} Western Front. By the end of the war, he had advanced in rank to brigadier general, commanding a number of brigades in the New Zealand Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart {{to volunteer for}} the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, along with another brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By {{the time he reached}} South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>contingent.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 October 1899 Davies {{transferred}} {{into the}} Permanent Force of the New Zealand Militia, {{where he was}} made responsible for the training of volunteer mounted units. The Boer War, however, was declared a week later; Davies was quickly seconded to command a company of the volunteer First New Zealand Contingent {{being sent to the}} Cape. <b>The</b> <b>contingent</b> sailed on 21 October, arrived in late November, and was on active service within a week. Davies was promoted to Major in May 1900, and in the same month was given temporary command of the Third New Zealand Contingent. He was transferred to the Rhodesian Field Force, where he commanded the Fourth New Zealand Contingent in August 1900.|$|E

5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and <b>the</b> <b>contingent</b> from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{betrayed by}} Muirchertach, Magnus {{may also have}} been betrayed by his own men (in {{particular}} <b>the</b> <b>contingent</b> of nobleman Torgrim Skinnluve from the Uplands, who fled to the ships during the battle). It is possible that Torgrim and his men may have been directed by powerful men in Norway, who wanted Magnus removed from the Norwegian throne. More Irishmen than Norwegians fell in the battle, according to Snorri Sturluson, and Magnus' reign could have been different if Torgrim and his men had fought as directed. Magnus' son Sigurd returned to Norway without his child bride after his father's defeat, and direct Norwegian control in the region came to an end. Although Norwegian influence remained, no Norwegian king returned for more than 150 years.|$|E
