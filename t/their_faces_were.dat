5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. <b>Their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E

25|$|An {{investigative team}} {{of up to}} 70 {{officers}} from 8 different police agencies formed the Integrated Riot Investigation Team, which was tasked with sifting through {{hundreds of hours of}} video and other evidence to determine the identity of those {{who took part in the}} riot. Several participants in the riots turned themselves in to police after <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> broadcast on TV, including the person responsible for setting the first car on fire. More than 1,000,000 photos and 1,200 – 1,600 hours of video recorded by citizens were sent to the Vancouver Police Department as evidence. , police had recommended 1,204 criminal charges against 352 suspected rioters. In July 2015, over four years after the riots, the last two suspects were charged. By then, a total of 887 criminal charges had been laid against 301 suspects, 274 of whom pled guilty. However police said they would continue to act on any tips they are provided and future charges could be laid.|$|E
25|$|Caseros {{was used}} as a place to {{dismantle}} stolen cars during the 1990s. At the time there was also a mysterious episode in which two inmates were allowed out into the street for a night to go on a robbing spree. They shot and killed someone {{in the course of the}} night, and <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> caught on camera. The next morning they were safely back in their cells, but the police identified them through the videotapes and began to investigate. Within the next three weeks, one of the inmates was found dead in his cell, apparently as a result of suicide. But his fellow inmates doubted the possibility of suicide, since he hadn't shown any signs of being suicidal. The guards who had let them out for a night in exchange for a cut of the booty were obvious suspects. Eventually all the guards were arrested as a part of the investigation, and held in custody for nearly a year. One guard was tried and found guilty of murder, receiving a sentence of twenty years in prison.|$|E
500|$|Main {{character}} {{heads were}} initially sculpted in either Plasticine or clay. Once the general aspect had been finalised, this {{served as the}} template for a silicone rubber mould. This was coated with Bondaglass (fibreglass mixed with resin) and enhanced with Bondapaste, a putty-like substance, to accentuate contours. The Bondaglass shell was then fitted with a solenoid, leather mouth parts and plastic eyes, as well as incisor teeth– a first for a Supermarionation production. Puppets known as [...] "revamps", which had plastic heads, portrayed the supporting characters. These marionettes started their working lives with only a mouth and eyes; <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> remoulded from one episode to the next. Particularly striking revamp moulds were retained and, as their numbers increased, photographed to compile an internal casting directory.|$|E

500|$|Conein {{knew that}} if he saw the {{execution}} wounds, {{he would not be able}} to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington. The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. <b>Their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in Time read [...] "'Suicide' with no hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan and Rabbi Eleazar {{differed}} {{on how the}} Cherubim stood. One {{said that}} they faced each other, and the other said they faced inward (toward the door). The Gemara asked how one could reconcile the view that they faced each other with 2 Chronicles [...] which says, [...] "And <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> inward." [...] The Gemara explained that they faced each other (in a sign of affection, symbolizing the relationship between God and the people) when Israel obeyed God's will of God; they faced inward (away from each other, symbolizing God's unrequited love for Israel) when Israel did not obey God's will. The Gemara asked how one could reconcile the view that they faced inward with , which says, [...] "With their faces one to another." [...] The Gemara explained that they were slightly turned sideways (partly facing each other and partly facing inward). As it was taught in a Baraita, Onkelos the proselyte said that the Cherubim were formed like children (as some read [...] ) and <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> turned sideways, {{like those of a}} student who takes leave of the student's master (turning sideways for some distance before turning the student's back completely on the master).|$|E

Fayet {{worked with the}} atelier from 1552 to 1563. His style of sculpting was so similar to the Prigent brothers that it is sometimes difficult to tell their work apart.

Both were hospitalised {{as a result of the}} attack, initially at Rochdale Infirmary. Maltby's injuries left him in a coma and with internal bleeding. He gradually recovered, but had lost memory of the time leading up to, and during, the attack. Lancaster, in a deep coma, was placed on life support and moved to Fairfield General Hospital in Bury, then to the neurology unit at Hope Hospital (now Salford Royal Hospital) in Salford. The hospital staff determined that she would never regain consciousness, and on 24 August 2007 her life support was terminated.|$|E

The other body had disintegrated, and small pieces were picked up as much as 200 yards away.|$|E
2500|$|The Talmud deduces two {{possible}} explanations, one attributed to Rab {{and one to}} Rabbi Samuel, for what Ham did to Noah to warrant the curse. According to Rab, Ham castrated Noah on the basis that, since Noah cursed Ham by his fourth son Canaan, Ham must have injured Noah {{with respect to a}} fourth son. Emasculating him thus deprived Noah of the possibility of a fourth son. According to Samuel, Ham sodomized Noah, a judgment that he based on analogy with another biblical incident in which the phrase [...] "and he saw" [...] is used: With regard to Ham and Noah, Genesis 9 reads, [...] " [...] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. [...] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness." [...] In [...] it reads, [...] "And when Shechem the son of Hamor saw her (Dinah), he took her and lay with her and defiled her." [...] According to this argument, similar abuse must have happened each time that the Bible uses the same language. The Talmud concludes that, in fact, [...] "both indignities were perpetrated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ironically, Byrnes was {{initially}} {{seen as a}} relative moderate on race issues. Recognizing that the South could not continue with its entrenched segregationist policies much longer but fearful of Congress imposing sweeping change upon the South, he opted for a course of change from within. To that end, he sought to fulfill at last the [...] "separate but equal" [...] policy which the South had put forward in Supreme Court civil rights cases, particularly in regard to public education. Byrnes poured state money into improving Negro schools, buying new textbooks and new buses, and hiring additional teachers. He also sought to curb {{the power of the}} Ku Klux Klan by passing a law that prohibited adults from wearing a mask in public on any day other than Halloween; he knew that many Klansmen feared exposure, and would not appear in public in their robes unless <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> hidden as well. Byrnes hoped to make South Carolina an example for other Southern states to follow in modifying their [...] "Jim Crow" [...] policies. Nonetheless, the NAACP sued South Carolina to force the state to desegregate its schools. Byrnes requested Kansas, a Midwestern state which also segregated its schools, to provide an Amicus curiae brief in supporting the right of a state to segregate its schools. This gave the NAACP's lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, the idea to shift the suit from South Carolina over to Kansas, which led directly to Brown v. Board of Education.|$|E
