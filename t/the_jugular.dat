5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|With smaller prey, such as {{monkeys and}} hares, the tiger bites the nape, often {{breaking}} the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> vein or common carotid artery. Though rarely observed, some tigers {{have been recorded}} to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle, and break the backs of sloth bears.|$|E
5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug {{on one side}} and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E

5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
40|$|Meningiomas {{frequently}} invade cerebral venus sinuses, especially parasagittal meningioma to superior sagittal sinus. However, most invasions do {{not reach}} internal jugular vein. We present {{a case of}} parasagittal meningioma extending into <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> vein through <b>the</b> sinuses. Radiological investigation revealed that the tumor was invading the sagittal, transverse, sigmoid sinus and junction of <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> vein to subclavian vein, which was filled with tumor. The histopathological examinations revealed that both the cerebral tumor and mass in <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> vein contributed to the transitional meningioma. This is a rare case of a meningioma extending into <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> vein through <b>the</b> sinuses. According to this case, the frontal parasagittal meningioma could invade directly <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> vein. <b>The</b> significance of this association to cerebral venus sinuses and internal jugular vein are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E

25|$|AF {{can cause}} {{respiratory}} distress due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, {{the heart rate}} will be greater than 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) non-invasive blood pressure monitors. For this reason, when determining heart rate in AF, direct cardiac auscultation is recommended. Low blood pressure is most concerning and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation {{of congestive heart failure}} due to the reduced cardiac output. Respiratory rate will be increased in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of hypoxia related to any precipitating factors such as pneumonia. Examination of <b>the</b> <b>jugular</b> veins may reveal elevated pressure (jugular venous distention). Lung exam may reveal crackles, which are suggestive of pulmonary edema.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Compressing <b>the</b> {{internal}} <b>jugular</b> veins can reverse ventriculomegaly in {{the syndrome}} of inappropriately low pressure acute hydrocephalus, {{and it has}} been suggested that this works by "stiffening" <b>the</b> brain tissue. <b>Jugular</b> compression may also alter blood and CSF flow in other conditions. We aimed to understand <b>the</b> effect of <b>jugular</b> compression on brain tissue stiffness and CSF flow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The head and neck of 9 healthy volunteers were studied with and without jugular compression. Brain stiffness (shear modulus) was measured by using MR elastography. Phase-contrast MR imaging was used to measure CSF flow in the cerebral aqueduct and blood flow in the neck. RESULTS: The shear moduli of the brain tissue increased with the percentage of blood draining through <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> veins during venous compression. Peak velocity of caudally directed CSF in the aqueduct increased significantly with jugular compression (P <. 001). <b>The</b> mean <b>jugular</b> venous flow rate, amplitude, and vessel area were significantly reduced with jugular compression, while cranial arterial flow parameters were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Jugular compression influences cerebral CSF hydrodynamics in healthy subjects and can increase brain tissue stiffness, but the magnitude of the stiffening depends on the percentage of cranial blood draining through <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> veins during compression−that is, subjects who maintain venous drainage through <b>the</b> internal <b>jugular</b> veins during jugular compression have stiffer brains than those who divert venous blood through alternative pathways. These methods may be useful for studying this phenomenon in patients with the syndrome of inappropriately low-pressure acute hydrocephalus and other conditions. 7 page(s...|$|R
