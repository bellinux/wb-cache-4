50|$|The <b>tub</b> <b>file</b> was a {{technique}} {{used in the}} punched card era to speed generation of data files. Multiple copies of frequently used cards were prepunched and stored in trays with index tabs between card sets, arranged so that cards {{would be easy to}} find. For example, a wholesaler might have a <b>tub</b> <b>file</b> with cards <b>for</b> frequent customers and for each inventory item. Instead of keypunching a set of cards for each purchase order, a clerk would pull out a customer card and then a card for each item that customer ordered. The resulting deck could then be run through a tabulating machine to produce an invoice. This technique was an early form of random access memory and was the initial inspiration for the invention of the hard disk at IBM's San Jose Laboratory, what eventually became the IBM 305 RAMAC.|$|R

5000|$|The first RAMAC {{to be used}} in the U.S. auto {{industry}} was installed at Chrysler's MOPAR Division in 1957. It replaced a huge <b>tub</b> <b>file</b> which was part of MOPAR's parts inventory control and order processing system. The 305 was one of the last vacuum tube computers that IBM built. It weighed over a ton. The IBM 350 disk system stored 5 million alphanumeric characters recorded as 6 data bits, 1 parity bit and one space bit for 8 bits recorded per character. It had fifty 24 in disks. Two independent access arms moved up and down to select a disk, and in and out to select a recording track, all under servo control. Average time to locate a single record was 600 milliseconds. Several improved models were added in the 1950s. The IBM RAMAC 305 system with 350 disk storage leased for US$3,200 (...) per month. More than 1,000 systems were built. Production ended in 1961; the RAMAC computer became obsolete in 1962 when the IBM 1405 Disk Storage Unit for the IBM 1401 was introduced, and the 305 was withdrawn in 1969.|$|R
