5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it {{can be applied to the}} universe as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining <b>these</b> <b>simple</b> solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, <b>these</b> <b>simple</b> assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we present factorized test {{generation}} techniques {{that can be}} used to generate test cases from a specification that is modelled as a labelled transition system. The test generation techniques are able to construct a sound (and complete) test suite for correctness criterion miocoF [5] by splitting up this correctness criterion into many simpler correctness criteria, and by generating tests for <b>these</b> <b>simpler</b> correctness criteria. By isolating the relevant part of the specification that is needed to generate tests for each of <b>these</b> <b>simpler</b> correctness criteria and using this part to generate tests from, test generation can be done more efficiently. These techniques are intended to keep the generation of tests from a specification feasible and manageable...|$|R

25|$|Amylases {{are used}} in {{breadmaking}} and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on <b>these</b> <b>simple</b> sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|E
25|$|For {{very large}} numbers, <b>these</b> <b>simple</b> methods are inefficient because they perform {{a large number}} of multiplications or {{divisions}} where one operand is very large. A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective asymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10k, where k is chosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these pieces is converted to decimal and the two are concatenated. Given a decimal number, it can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is converted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10k and added to the second converted piece, where k is the number of decimal digits in the second, least-significant piece before conversion.|$|E

25|$|Not {{all works}} during this era were {{on such a}} large scale. Indeed, the {{commission}} Bernini received to build the church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale for the Jesuits was relatively modest in physical size (though great in its interior chromatic splendor), which Bernini executed completely free of charge. Sant'Andrea shared with the St. Peter's piazza—unlike the complex geometries of his rival Francesco Borromini—a focus on basic geometric shapes, circles and ovals to create spiritually intense buildings. Equally, Bernini moderated the presence of colour and decoration within these buildings, focussing visitors' attention on <b>these</b> <b>simple</b> forms that underpinned the building. Sculptural decoration was never eliminated, but its use was more minimal. He also designed the church of Santa Maria dell'Assunzione {{in the town of}} Ariccia with its circular outline, rounded dome and three-arched portico.|$|E
25|$|While Russell wrote a {{great deal}} on ethical subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to {{philosophy}} or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were objective, but known only through intuition; that they were simple properties of objects, not equivalent (e.g., pleasure is good) to the natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see Naturalistic fallacy); and that <b>these</b> <b>simple,</b> undefinable moral properties cannot be analysed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to agree with his philosophical hero, David Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with subjective values that cannot be verified {{in the same way as}} matters of fact.|$|E
25|$|Both William and Anne {{appointed}} {{and dismissed}} Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and {{followed up on}} actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was {{an essential part of}} evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although George I (1714–1727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions. George II (1727–1760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his grandson, George III (1760–1820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that Sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The Prime Minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. <b>These</b> <b>simple</b> executive tasks naturally gave the Prime Minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.|$|E
