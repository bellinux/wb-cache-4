40|$|For {{the first}} time the Pierre Auger Collaboration presents〈Xmax〉and σ(Xmax) {{measurements}} covering nearly three decades of energy. In this analysis we include new Xmax data obtained with the High Elevation Auger Telescopes (HEAT) enhancement. The HEAT <b>telescopes</b> <b>cover</b> a field of view ranging from 30 ◦ to 60 ◦ of elevation and are located next to one of the standard fluorescence detector sites (Coihueco). The combination of the HEAT and Coihueco <b>telescopes</b> <b>covers</b> a field of view from ∼ 2 ◦ up to ∼ 60 ◦ of elevation. Thus, the combination can sample the longitudinal profile of nearby lower energy showers, allowing us to extend the energy range down to 10 [sup] 17 eV...|$|R

50|$|The {{inner cover}} {{provides}} a barrier between the <b>telescoping</b> <b>cover</b> and the bees. In more temperate climates, a plastic foil {{may be used}} as an inner cover. Plastic foil should not be used to winter bees under, as trapped condensation would cause the hive to become wet, and bees can be lost due to freezing when temperatures fall during the night. In areas with a hot summer, a solid inner cover with a communication hole provides dead-air space for insulation against both heat and cold. This prevents the bees from gluing the top cover to the top bars of the super under it. When an inner cover is used, the top cover is more easily removed from the hive. Notches in the frame of the solid inner <b>cover</b> and <b>telescoping</b> <b>cover</b> can serve as an upper entrance for the bees. A communication hole in the middle allows bees to reach emergency food placed above by the beekeeper if it becomes required.|$|R

50|$|The hard X-ray and {{low-energy}} gamma-ray SIGMA <b>telescope</b> <b>covered</b> {{the energy}} range 35-1300 keV, with an effective area of 800 cm2 {{and a maximum}} sensitivity field of view of ~5° &times; 5°. The maximum angular resolution was 15 arcmin. The energy resolution was 8% at 511 keV. Its imaging capabilities were derived from the association of a coded mask and a position sensitive detector based on the Anger camera principle.|$|R

5000|$|In its {{original}} form, the National hive provides ⅜" [...] (9mm) bottom beespace—that is, the top {{surface of the}} frame bar is flush with {{the top of the}} box, and the lower surface of the frame is one bee space above the bottom of the box. Thus, when two boxes are stacked atop one another, there is exactly one beespace vertically between the frames. However, both top and bottom beespace designs may now be found in use.The roof shown in the MAFF leaflet is a <b>telescoping</b> <b>cover,</b> with internal dimensions of 18¾" [...] (476mm), meaning a relatively loose fit over the topmost box. The total height of the roof is (depending on timber thickness) around 6¼" [...] (160mm), though a 4" [...] roof is now also common. Supports set into the roof create a 1¼" [...] ventilation space above the crownboard rim (therefore 1½" [...] above the crownboard surface, as it has a raised rim creating ¼" [...] beespace on both sides): the total overlap of the <b>telescoping</b> <b>cover</b> is thus 4.5" [...] (114mm). The roof must be covered with a waterproofing layer: typically this may be galvanized steel sheet.|$|R
5000|$|The wagons were {{effectively}} a flat underframe, {{fitted with}} a large <b>covered</b> <b>box.</b> The box contained two pairs of sloped sheets so that the cement powder was carried in two separate compartments; each of these fed a single hatch adjacent to the bogies. This gave capacity for just over [...] of cement powder, equalling roughly 43 LT loaded.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a wooden}} or {{polystyrene}} cover that fits {{on the top}} of the hive. In higher latitudes (further north in the Northern Hemisphere; further south in the Southern Hemisphere), a <b>cover</b> which <b>telescopes</b> down around the inner cover and an inch or so down over the top super, called a <b>telescoping</b> <b>cover,</b> is usually used. Many commercial beekeepers use what is known as a migratory cover, a solid cover which does not extend beyond the sides of a hive body.|$|R

30|$|To {{achieve an}} optimal f_B, a Cassegrain-type {{reflector}} {{is a good}} choice for the receiving telescope despite the decreased telescope transmission Λ_TB due to the secondary mirror (which we estimate to be − 1.5  dB in total). This is because the overall design is lightweight and the required f_B of 40  cm can be realized with a 10  cm long <b>telescope.</b> The <b>telescope</b> <b>covers</b> the CubeSat’s square Z+ surface of about 9  × 9  cm. For simplicity, our calculations assume a circular telescope with D_B= 10 cm.|$|R
