40|$|The {{transmission}} of Buruli ulcer (BU), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), remains puzzling although {{a number of}} hypothesis including through bites of infected aquatic insects have been proposed. We report the results of experiments using ICR mice that give credence to our hypothesis that Acanthamoeba species {{may play a role}} in BU transmission. We cocultured <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 and <b>MU</b> 1615 which expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP) and Acanthamoeba polyphaga (AP), and confirmed infected AP by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining. We tested for viability of MU inside AP and observed strong RFP signals inside both trophozoites and cysts after 3 and 42 days of coculturing respectively. ICR mice were topically treated, either on shaved intact or shaved pinpricked rumps, with one of the following; <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 only (2. 25 x 106 colony forming units [CFU] / ml), <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 :AP coculture (2. 96 x 104 CFU: 1. 6 x 106 cells/ml), AP only (1. 6 x 106 cells/ml), PYG medium and sterile distilled water. Both <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 only and <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 :AP elicited reddening on day (D) 31; edema on D 45 and D 44 respectively, and ulcers on D 49 at pinpricked sites only. To ascertain infectivity and pathogenicity of <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 only and <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 :AP, and compare their virulence, the standard mouse footpad inoculation method was used. <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 :AP elicited reddening in footpads by D 3 compared to D 14 with <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 only of the same dose of <b>MU</b> <b>N</b> 2 (2. 96 x 104 CFU). ZN-stained MU were observed in both thin sectioned and homogenized lesions, and aspirates from infected sites.

This study demonstrates in ICR mice MU transmission via passive infection, and shows that punctures in the skin are prerequisite for infection, and that coculturing of MU with AP enhances pathogenesis...|$|R

Denitrification rates in the four river mouths varied between 330 and 905 <b>mu</b> mol <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1).

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} to the measurement of nanofriction, and demonstrate {{the application of the}} method by measurement of the coefficient of friction for diamondlike carbon (DLC) on DLC, Si on DLC, and Si on Si surfaces. The technique employs an atomic force microscope in a mode in which the tip moves only in the z (vertical) direction and the sample surface is sloped. As the tip moves vertically on the sloped surface, lateral tip slipping occurs, allowing the cantilever vertical deflection and the frictional (lateral) force to be monitored as a function of tip vertical deflection. The advantage of the approach is that cantilever calibration to obtain its spring constants is not necessary. Using this method, the authors have measured friction coefficients, for load range 0 < L M 6 <b>mu</b> <b>N,</b> of 0. 047 +/- 0. 002 for Si on Si, 0. 0173 +/- 0. 0009 for Si on DLC, and 0. 0080 +/- 0. 0005 for DLC on DLC.

40|$|Nanomechanical {{tests of}} bending flexibility, kinking, and {{buckling}} failure characterization of vertically aligned single crystal ZnO nanorods/nanowires were performed quantitatively by nanoindentation technique. These nanostructures were grown by the vapor liquid solid (VLS) method, {{a relatively high}} temperature approach, and the aqueous chemical growth (ACG) method, a relatively low temperature approach on different substrates, including SiC and Si. The first critical load at the inflection point found for the ZnO nanorods/nanowires grown by ACG method was 105 <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> on the SiC substrates and 114 <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> on the Si substrates. The corresponding buckling energies calculated from the force-displacement curves were 3. 15 x 10 (- 12) and 2. 337 x 10 (- 12) J, respectively. Similarly, for the samples grown by the VLS method, the first critical load at the inflection point and the corresponding buckling energies were calculated from the force-displacement curves as 198 <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> and 7. 03 x 10 (- 12) J on the SiC substrates, and 19 <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> and 1. 805 x 10 (- 13) J on the Si substrates. Moreover, the critical buckling stress, strain, and strain energy were also calculated for all samples. The strain energy for all samples was {{much less than the}} corresponding buckling energy. This shows that our as-grown samples are elastic and flexible. The elasticity measurement was performed for all the samples before reaching the first critical and kinking inflection point, and we subsequently observed the bending flexibility, kinking, and buckling phenomena on the same nanorods/nanowires. We observed that the loading and unloading behaviors during the bending test of the as-grown samples were highly symmetrical, and also that the highest point on the bending curves and the first inflection and critical point were very close. ZnO nanorods/nanowires grown on SiC by the ACG method, and those grown by the VLS method on Si substrates, show a linear relation and high modulus of elasticity for the force and displacement up to the first inflection and critical point. The results also show that the elasticity of the ZnO single crystal is approximately linear up to the first inflection point, is independent of the growth method and is strongly dependent on the verticality {{on the surface of the}} substrates. In addition, the results show that after the first buckling point, the nanorods/nanowires have plasticity, and become more flexible to produce multiple kinks.

40|$|Measuring forces {{applied by}} multi-cellular organisms is {{valuable}} in investigating biomechanics of their locomotion. Several technologies {{have been developed}} to measure such forces, for example, strain gauges, micro-machined sensors, and calibrated cantilevers. We introduce an innovative combination of techniques as a high throughput screening tool to assess forces applied by multiple genetic model organisms. First, we fabricated colored Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropillars where the color enhances contrast making it easier to detect and track pillar displacement driven by the organism. Second, we developed a semiautomated graphical user interface to analyze the images for pillar displacement, thus reducing the analysis time for each animal to minutes. The addition of color reduced the Young's modulus of PDMS. Therefore, the dye-PDMS composite was characterized using Yeoh's hyperelastic model and the pillars were calibrated using a silicon based force sensor. We used our device to measure forces exerted by wild type and mutant Caenorhabditis elegans moving on an agarose surface. Wild type C. elegans exert an average force of similar to 1 <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> on an individual pillar and a total average force of similar to 7. 68 <b>mu</b> <b>N.</b> We show that the middle of C. elegans exerts more force than its extremities. We find that C. elegans mutants with defective body wall muscles apply significantly lower force on individual pillars, while mutants defective in sensing externally applied mechanical forces still apply the same average force per pillar compared to wild type animals. Average forces applied per pillar are independent of the length, diameter, or cuticle stiffness of the animal. We also used the device to measure, for the first time, forces applied by Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Peristaltic waves occurred at 0. 4 Hz applying an average force of similar to 1. 58 <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> on a single pillar.

Because clonidine potentiates the analgesic effects of opioids without increasing their side effects, the authors wanted to determine the efficacy of low doses of intrathecal clonidine (15 and 30 mu g) combined with sufentanil. Methods: Ninety-eight parturient requesting labor analgesia were studied. In a combined spinal-epidural technique, patients mere randomly assigned to receive one of the following intrathecal solutions: either 15 <b>mu</b> g clonidine (<b>n</b> = 10); 30 <b>mu</b> g clonidine (<b>n</b> = 10); 2. 5 <b>mu</b> g sufentanil (<b>n</b> = 13); 5 <b>mu</b> g sufentanil (<b>n</b> = 13); 2. 5 mu g sufentanil and 15 <b>mu</b> g clonidine (<b>n</b> = 13); 2. 5 mu g sufentanil and 30 <b>mu</b> g clonidine (<b>n</b> = 13); 5 mu g sufentanil and 15 <b>mu</b> g clonidine (<b>n</b> = 13); or 5 mu g sufentanil and 30 <b>mu</b> g clonidine (<b>n</b> = 13).

In estuaries where gradients of salinity and ammonia concentrations occur, there may be differential selections for ammonia-oxidizer populations. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the activity, abundance, and diversity of AOA and AOB in surface oxic sediments of a highly nutrified estuary that exhibits gradients of salinity and ammonium. AOB and AOA communities were investigated by measuring ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene abundance and nitrification potentials both spatially and temporally. Nitrification potentials differed along the estuary and over time, with the greatest nitrification potentials occurring mid-estuary (8. 2 <b>mu</b> mol <b>N</b> grams dry weight [gdw](- 1) day(- 1) in June, increasing to 37. 4 <b>mu</b> mol <b>N</b> gdw(- 1) day(- 1) in January).

AOB amoA gene abundances were significantly greater (by 100 -fold) than those of AOA both spatially and temporally. Nitrosomonas spp. were detected along the estuary by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band sequence analysis. In conclusion, AOB dominated over AOA in the estuarine sediments, with the ratio of AOB/AOA amoA gene abundance increasing from the upper (freshwater) to lower (marine) regions of the Colne estuary.

40|$|The {{tensions}} {{produced in}} {{the wall of a}} rigid, thin-walled, liquid-filled sphere as it moves with an axisymmetric straining flow are examined. This problem has not been previously addressed. A generalised correlation for the maximum wall tension, expressed in dimensionless form as a Weber number (We), is developed in terms of the acceleration number (Ac) and Reynolds number (Re) of the straining flow. At low Reynolds number We is dominated by viscous forces, while inertial forces due to internal pressure gradients caused by sphere acceleration dominate at higher Re. The generalised correlation has been used to examine the case of a typical yeast cell (a thin-walled, liquid-filled sphere) passing through a typical high-pressure homogeniser (a straining-flow device). At 56 MPa homogenising pressure, a 6 mu m yeast cell experiences tensions in the inertially dominated regime (Re = 100). The correlation gives We = 0. 206, corresponding to a maximum wall tension of 8 Nm(- 1). This is equivalent to an applied compressive force of 150 <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> and compares favourably with the force required to break yeast cells under compressive micromanipulation (40 - 90 <b>mu</b> <b>N).</b> Inertial forces may therefore be an important and previously unrecognised. mechanism of microbial cell disruption during high-pressure homogenisation. Further work is required to examine the likelihood of cell deformation in the high-strain-rate short-residence-time environment of the homogeniser, and the effect that such deformation may have on the contribution of inertial forces to disruption.

The non-linear mode coupling effects of this longitudinal multi-mode laser was investigated and stable pulse sequence was attributed to the non-linear mode coupling effects between main mode oscillation and the side-mode oscillation.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comprehensive}} study of charged lepton flavour violation in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models in a fully 5 D quantum-field-theoretical framework. We consider the RS model with minimal field content and a "custodially protected" extension as well as three implementations of the IR-brane localized Higgs field, including the non-decoupling effect of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of a narrow bulk Higgs. Our calculation provides the first complete result for the flavour-violating electromagnetic dipole operator in Randall-Sundrum models. It contains three contributions with different dependence on {{the magnitude of the}} anarchic 5 D Yukawa matrix, which can all be important in certain parameter regions. We study the typical range for the branching fractions of mu -> e gamma, mu -> 3 e, <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> -> e N as well as tau -> mu gamma, tau -> 3 mu and the electron electric dipole moment by a numerical scan in both the minimal and the custodial RS model. The combination of mu -> e gamma and <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> -> e N currently provides the most stringent constraint on the parameter space of the model. A typical lower limit on the KK scale T is around 2 TeV in the minimal model (up to 4 TeV in the bulk Higgs case with large Yukawa couplings), and around 4 TeV in the custodially protected model, which corresponds to a mass of about 10 TeV for the first KK excitations, far beyond the lower limit from the non-observation of direct production at the LHC.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} batch micrufabrication and electrical contacting of bulk SMA nticroactuators. This concept addresses technical solutions for the main challenges related to using SMA actuators such as the necessary mechanical bias force, the difficult electrical contacting and the high power needed for actuation. We report on initial SMA-dielectric-metal trimorph test structures and their characteristics. The bias force is provided by a dielectric layer and the electrical contacting of the bulk SMA is avoided using indirect electrical heating via an additional metal layer. Three nun long beams can provide several hundreds of <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> and deflect several hundreds of mu m. The actuation power is reduced approx. 2. 5 times compared to direct heating schemes.

40|$|The spatial {{variability}} of N 2 O emission from soil makes extrapolation {{to the field}} scale very difficult using conventional chamber techniques (< 1 m(2)). Micrometeorological techniques, which integrate N 2 O fluxes over areas of 0. 1 to 1 km(2) were therefore developed and compared with chamber methods over arable cropland. Measurements of N 2 O emission from an unfertilised organic soil (reclaimed from the sea in 1879) were made over a 10 d period at Lammefjord, Denmark. Flux-gradient and conditional sampling techniques were applied using two tunable diode laser spectrometers (TDLs), a Fourier transform infra-red spectrometer (FTIR) and a gas chromatograph (GC). Eddy covariance measurements were also made by the TDLs. Over the 10 d campaign approximately 5 d of continuous fluxes by the different methods were obtained. Fluxes determined by eddy covariance were in reasonable agreement, showing a mean flux of 269 <b>mu</b> g <b>N</b> m(2) h(- 1). Flux-gradient techniques measured a mean flux of 226 <b>mu</b> g <b>N</b> m(- 2) h(- 1). The mean flux measured by conditional sampling was 379 <b>mu</b> g <b>N</b> m(- 2) h(- 1).

40|$|MEXT [21014006, 24121001, S 20221002]The {{relative}} importance of new nitrogen sources for primary production was investigated in well stratified subtropical waters {{in the vicinity of}} the shelf edge of the East China Sea by concurrent determinations of upward turbulent nitrate flux across the pycnocline, nitrate assimilation, N- 2 fixation and primary production. On the coastal side of the Kuroshio jet close to the shelf edge, strong vertical diffusivity K-rho was observed. The half-day mean K-rho at the top nitracline was 3. 9 x 10 (- 5) m(2) s(- 1). Consequently, a higher turbulent upward nitrate flux of 445 <b>mu</b> mol <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) across the nitracline was observed than that of 82 <b>mu</b> mol <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) off the shelf near the Kuroshio jet and 146 <b>mu</b> mol <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1) on the slope at the outer side of the Kuroshio jet. This high upward flux supported the highest rates of primary production (27. 3 mmol C cm(- 2) d(- 1)) and nitrate assimilation (764 <b>mu</b> mol <b>N</b> m(- 2) d(- 1)), and the contribution of the upward nitrate flux to new nitrogen was 5. 7 times higher than that of N- 2 fixation. In contrast, N- 2 fixation was a major new nitrogen source at stations off the shelf, where the upward nitrate flux was less evident due to less vertical diffusivity and weaker vertical nitrate gradients than near the shelf break in the Kuroshio jet. These observations demonstrate that new nitrogen sources were highly variable according to relative locations at the shelf edge and Kuroshio jet in the East China Sea and the adjacent waters during summer.

40|$|Adhesion is an {{important}} surface phenomenon that controls many physical events in nature and technology. The use of miniature devices like comb drives, and contact MEMS is still limited mostly due to adhesive interactions of free standing structures and friction, respectively. Moreover, adhesion is {{an important}} friction mechanism at low normal forces. In this study, the interplay between surface roughness and adhesion force was studied and consequently their influence on the friction force at low normal forces {{in the range of}} <b>mu</b> <b>Ns</b> was experimentally investigated. Friction studies were carried out through a series of bi-directional sliding tests on commonly used engineering surfaces like silicon wafer, TiN, and DLC coatings using a high precision modular microtribometer in a ball-on-plane configuration. This study illustrates how friction operates between rough multiasperity contacts under contact stresses below 125 MPa. Force volume imaging was performed using an AFM on surfaces with different surface roughness. For rough surfaces, a large fluctuation in the local adhesion force was observed instead of an overall decrease in adhesion as reported in the literature. As the normal force decreases, the influence of the adhesion component on friction increases resulting in a high coefficient of friction especially on silicon and DLC surfaces. Hydrogenated DLC surfaces can exhibit low friction only when the surface is rough. On the other hand, TiN coatings are less sensitive to changes in surface roughness, and exhibit a practically constant coefficient of friction due to a low adhesive component. The adhesion component of normal force could be estimated using JKR adhesion model. There is a clear dependence of sliding friction at low normal forces in the <b>mu</b> <b>N</b> range on adhesion events observed at the nano-N range. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
