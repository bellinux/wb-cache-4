5|$|Just as the Eiffel <b>Tower</b> <b>is</b> {{often used}} in popular culture to {{immediately}} locate a scene in Paris, France, the Tokyo <b>Tower</b> <b>is</b> {{often used in}} the same way for Tokyo. It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please Save My Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The <b>tower</b> <b>is</b> also frequently used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been the location of the climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic view of life in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E
50|$|The <b>towers</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} designed to separate the men and women.

5|$|The Ministry of Works {{took the}} tower into its {{guardianship}} in 1953 {{to address the}} problems, and promptly undertook an extensive sequence of repairs that lasted until 1958. No archaeological investigation was carried out during these works, however, and a full architectural survey of the building was only carried out between 1985 and 1986, by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission. In the 21st century, Cow <b>Tower</b> <b>is</b> managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the <b>tower</b> <b>is</b> now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof have been lost.

5|$|Another {{series of}} <b>towers</b> <b>were</b> built between 1658 and 1659. Fourteen <b>towers</b> <b>were</b> built in all, which are {{together}} {{known as the}} De Redin <b>towers.</b> These <b>were</b> based on the Lascaris towers and had the same function as a communication link. 13 <b>towers</b> <b>were</b> built on mainland Malta having an identical design, and 8 of these survive intact while 2 are in ruins.

50|$|The {{construction}} of the <b>tower</b> <b>was</b> commenced in 1997. Upon completion of its 11-year-long construction in 2008, the Milad <b>Tower</b> <b>was</b> considered the fourth-tallest freestanding telecommunication tower in the world. The <b>tower</b> <b>was</b> opened a year later, in 2008, albeit numerous conflicts {{on the history of}} the tower still prevail, such as some sources suggesting that the commencement of the <b>tower's</b> construction <b>was</b> a year earlier instead of 2000 and that the <b>tower</b> <b>was</b> completed a year later instead of 2007.|$|R

50|$|In 1873, {{a wooden}} <b>tower</b> <b>was</b> built; it was {{destroyed}} twenty years later, followed in 1893 by an observation tower of steel.

5|$|Clifford's <b>Tower</b> <b>is</b> of {{an unusual}} design. The two-storey tower has a quatrefoil plan with four {{circular}} lobes. Each lobe measures 22 feet (6.5 metres) across, with walls 9 feet 6inches (3 metres) thick; at its widest, the <b>tower</b> <b>is</b> 79 feet (24 metres) across. A square gatehouse, 21 feet (6.5 metres) wide, protected the entrance {{on the south side}} between two of the lobes. There are defensive turrets between the other lobes. Large corbels and a central pier supported the huge weight of stone and the first floor. Loopholes of a design unique to York Castle provided firing points. A chapel was built over the entrance, measuring 15 feet by 14 feet (4.5 metres by 4.2 metres), doubling as a portcullis chamber as at Harlech and Chepstow Castles. The <b>tower</b> <b>is</b> believed to be an experiment in improving flanking fire by making more ground visible from the summit of the keep. Although unique to England, the design of the tower closely resembles that at Étampes in France, and may have influenced the design of the future keep of Pontefract Castle. Henry employed master mason Henry de Rayns and chief carpenter Simon of Northampton for the project, and the cost of the tower accounted {{for the majority of the}} overall expenditure on the castle during this period of work.|$|E
