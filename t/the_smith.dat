5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E

5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> Gun. <b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> Gun had what Mackenzie describes as an 'unorthodox origin', {{like many of the}} other weapons produced for use by the Home Guard. Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. <b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured anti-tank weapon.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the membership clause of <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy of violence against the government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> Gun was {{an ad hoc}} {{anti-tank}} artillery piece used by the British Army and Home Guard {{during the}} Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank weaponry. <b>The</b> <b>Smith</b> Gun was designed by a retired Army Major named William H. Smith as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|US 199 {{begins at}} a partial {{interchange}} with US 101 northeast of Crescent City; Elk Valley Cross Road (County Route D2) connects the two routes {{just to the}} north for full access. The highway quickly enters the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, climbs over a ridge, crosses <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> River, and meets State Route 197 (which heads northwest to US 101 via <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> River). US 199 follows {{the banks of the}} river and its Middle Fork as it takes a steady but curvy climb through <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> River National Recreation Area in the Six Rivers National Forest, passing the settlements of Hiouchi, Gasquet and Patrick Creek. As it approaches the summit, the Middle Fork Smith River turns east, but US 199 continues northeast, following Griffin Creek to near its source (where there is a rest area), and passing under Hazel View Summit, the border between <b>the</b> <b>Smith</b> River NRA and the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, in the 1963 Collier Tunnel (elevation about 2100 feet/650 m). (The old curving route over the summit still exists as Oregon Mountain Road.) Upon leaving the tunnel, US 199 descends alongside the small Broken Kettle Creek into the Elk Valley and crosses into Oregon.|$|E

5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smiths</b> {{have been}} widely influential.
