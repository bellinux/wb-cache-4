25|$|On April 7, 1964, IBM {{announced}} the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range {{of commercial and}} scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies {{for the first time}} to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They, and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS <b>transaction</b> <b>processing</b> monitor, had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare.|$|E
25|$|In {{concurrency}} control of databases, <b>transaction</b> <b>processing</b> (transaction management), and other transactional distributed applications, Global serializability (or Modular serializability) is a property {{of a global}} schedule of transactions. A global schedule is the unified schedule of all the individual database (and other transactional object) schedules in a multidatabase environment (e.g., federated database). Complying with global serializability means that the global schedule is serializable, has the serializability property, while each component database (module) has a serializable schedule as well. In other words, a collection of serializable components provides overall system serializability, which is usually incorrect. A need in correctness across databases in multidatabase systems makes global serializability a major goal for global {{concurrency control}} (or modular concurrency control). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, and small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), as well as increase in systems management sophistication, the need for atomic distributed transactions and thus effective global serializability techniques, to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications, seems to increase.|$|E

40|$|We present {{recommendations}} on Performance Management for databases supporting Binary Large Objects (BLOB) that, under {{a wide range}} of conditions, save both storage space and database <b>transactions</b> <b>processing</b> time. The research shows that for database applications where ad hoc retrieval queries prevail, storing the actual values of BLOBs in the database may be the best choice to achieve better performance, whereas storing BLOBs externally is the best approach where multiple Delete/Insert/Update operations on BLOBs dominate. Performance measurements are used to discover System Performance Bottlenecks and their resolution. We propose a strategy of archiving large data collections in order to reduce data management overhead in the Relational Database and maintain acceptable response time. ...|$|R

2500|$|Jet {{supports}} <b>transaction</b> <b>processing</b> for database {{systems that}} have this capability. (ODBC systems have one-level <b>transaction</b> <b>processing,</b> while several ISAM systems like Paradox do not support <b>transaction</b> <b>processing.)</b> A transaction {{is a series of}} operations performed on a database that must be done together [...] this is known as atomicity {{and is one of the}} ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability), concepts considered to be the key <b>transaction</b> <b>processing</b> features of a database management system. For <b>transaction</b> <b>processing</b> to work (until Jet 3.0), the programmer needed to begin the transaction manually, perform the operations needed to be performed in the transaction, and then commit (save) the transaction. Until the transaction is committed, changes are made only in memory and not actually written to disk. Transactions have a number of advantages over independent database updates. One of the main advantages is that transactions can be abandoned if a problem occurs during the transaction. This is called rolling back the transaction, or just rollback, and it restores the state of the database records to precisely the state before the transaction began. Transactions also permit the state of the database to remain consistent if a system failure occurs in the middle of a sequence of updates required to be atomic. There is no chance that only some of the updates will end up written to the database; either all will succeed, or the changes will be discarded when the database system restarts. With ODBC's in-memory policy, transactions also allow for many updates to a record to occur entirely within memory, with only one expensive disk write at the end.|$|E
40|$|In GSM-WLAN {{heterogeneous}} networks, the authentication {{efficiency is}} one of the drawbacks for message <b>transaction</b> and <b>processing</b> in the RADIUS server.

In this paper, the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN simulation mode based on the Network Simulator 2 (NS- 2) is used to evaluate the performance including the authentication session time, message <b>transaction</b> load and <b>processing</b> load for the proposed authentication schemes and the conventional EAP-SIM authentication schemes. The results show that the proposed full authentication scheme can save about 20 % authentication session time compared to the conventional full authentication scheme, and the proposed iterative fast authentication scheme can save about 75 % authentication session time compared to the conventional fast re-authentication scheme. Therefore, the authentication efficiency of the proposed schemes is better than that with the conventional authentication schemes. </p...|$|R
