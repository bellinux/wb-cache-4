5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards <b>the</b> <b>satellite,</b> so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
5|$|As {{the signal}} passes through <b>the</b> <b>satellite,</b> it is {{translated}} by—added to—a signal generated by an oscillator in <b>the</b> <b>satellite.</b> Although the oscillator {{is housed in}} a temperature-controlled enclosure, it is subjected to thermal variation throughout the day that results in minor changes {{in the frequency of}} the translation signal. The thermal variation results from the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> relative to the sun over a given 24-hour period, including the time <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> passes through the Earth's shadow (which affected the 3:40 and 4:26 handshakes), and is complicated by the use of heaters that run when the oscillator temperature exits pre-determined limits. The variation in the translation frequency was calculated over several days, including the day of Flight 370's disappearance, and could be factored into the BFO measurement.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. <b>The</b> <b>satellite</b> transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. <b>The</b> <b>satellite</b> had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> COSMO-SkyMed <b>{{satellite}}s</b> are lesser-known deliverers {{of satellite}} flares, sometimes approaching magnitude −3. Flares come mainly from SAR-panels of <b>the</b> <b>satellites.</b> Although overshadowed by <b>the</b> Iridium <b>satellites,</b> <b>the</b> flares are often long-lasting, with <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> traversing {{much of the}} sky at brighter-than-average magnitudes.|$|R

50|$|The {{final phase}} of the mission will start once the {{communication}} architecture of <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> is reconfigured from the ground {{to work with the}} Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) network. This will make <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> available to amateur radio users all around the world. Once the ground station loses all communication with <b>the</b> <b>satellites,</b> <b>the</b> mission will be terminated and <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> will passively de-orbit, burning up in the atmosphere. The FASTRAC team has estimated that it will take six months to successfully achieve its mission objectives.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>satellite</b> {{continued}} operations until February 25, 1982, when it {{was removed}} from operations due to a faulty yaw control thruster. <b>The</b> <b>satellite</b> was placed in standby mode on March 31, 1983.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>satellite</b> {{was also}} {{equipped}} with a data collection system (DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations and to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Due to the orbit of <b>the</b> <b>satellite,</b> data could be obtained at a minimum of every 12 hours. No data processing or signal multiplexing occurred on <b>the</b> <b>satellite.</b> The design of the DCS came from the Nimbus-3 platform, then known as the interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS).|$|E
5|$|A few {{deductions}} can be {{made from}} <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> communications. The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards <b>the</b> <b>satellite,</b> so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> to the ground station; the frequency translations made in <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> have {{successfully}} separated, the primary mission will begin, signaling {{the start of}} fourth phase. First, <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> will autonomously establish a cross-link, or in other words, they will {{communicate with each other}} through UHF/VHF bands. <b>The</b> <b>satellites</b> will then exchange GPS data through this cross-link in order to calculate on-orbit real time relative navigation solutions.|$|R

50|$|The wing also {{operates}} {{satellite operation}} centers at Schriever AFB and remote tracking stations and other {{command and control}} facilities around the world. These facilities monitor satellites during launch, put <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> in their proper orbits following launch, operate <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> while they are in orbit, keep them functioning properly and properly dispose of <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> at their end of life.|$|R
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> at the calculated distance.|$|E

50|$|The {{third phase}} will begin once the two nanosatellites are {{ejected from the}} rocket. During this phase, {{there will be a}} 30-minute period where <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> will go through a check out and {{initialization}} process. After this period, <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> will begin transmitting beacon messages containing telemetry information that will help determine each satellite's status. During this phase the ground station will attempt to establish first contact with <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> and perform a check out procedure to make sure all the subsystems on board are working correctly. It is expected that this checkout procedure will take several hours or even a few days depending on the duration of the communication passes with the ground station.
