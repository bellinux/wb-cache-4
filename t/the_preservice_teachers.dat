40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study focused on}} the development of reflective practice with preservice teachers through a framework during an early field experience. The framework provided an explicit structure for <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> to investigate four focus areas (teachers role, active learning, culture, and assessment). <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> explored a focus area, dialogued via e-mail with a peer, and then discussed their findings in small groups. <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were given a pre and post survey that queried them about their beliefs related to the four focus areas and the concept of reflection. Content analysis of the explanatory statements on the survey, dialogue e-mails and written reflections after small group discussions, and focus group interviews guided a systematic examination of the data. The dialogue e-mails and written reflections were also analyzed using a rubric for reflective levels. The survey results indicated that while a substantial number of preservice teachers maintained the same belief after experiencing the framework of inquiry into practice, an equal or greater number of preservice teachers changed. These preservice teachers became more student-focused as the semester progressed. They also became increasingly self-critical of their own teaching practices which led them to alternative approaches. Consequently, these preservice teachers were able to articulate their beliefs in the context of teaching. The structure of the framework provided opportunities for <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> to rehearse reflective practice; thus teacher educators have an explicit methodological model for developing reflective practitioners. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> indicated that the framework increased self-monitoring which facilitated analysis of their teaching...|$|E

The findings point to the strong benefits of extended and extensive field experiences in K [...] 12 classrooms for preservice teachers. The extended field experiences provided a multi-tiered framework that allowed for peer mentoring and contextualized classroom experiences that contributed to an improved sense of self-efficacy as preservice teachers participated in hands-on teaching. <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> reported benefits of learning about teaching as well as learning to teach individual, small group, and large groups of elementary grade students. In addition, they reported the benefits of learning how to manage the classroom and communicate with students, teachers, and parents.

While teachers are responsible for a plethora of duties, it is important that teacher preparation programs provide adequate training to ensure teachers are well prepared for the teaching profession. However, previous research has found that teachers are not being adequately trained and consequently, they are experiencing problems within the classroom. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate whether the gender of <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher,</b> type of disability being taught, type of training institution, the university that <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> attends, and <b>the</b> number of hours credited for practicum training effects on the presence of five problem domains: training institution, problems related to university program, trainers/instructors, practicum plan and its requirements, and preservice teachers; and whether there was overall differences on the presence of the problems in general.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{becoming}} a teacher integrates and distils past and social experiences, and episodes in life that result in a cumulative history. This history can shape the identity of student, <b>teacher</b> and <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> to ultimately {{become part of the}} broader context of education. Increasingly, we see students entering the teaching profession from diverse backgrounds that include a cross-section of vocational, cultural and international contexts and circumstances. This is largely representative of today’s mobilized  communities that have been shaped and defined by a globalized marketplace. In this article I discuss issues of identity of <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> in light of trending  globalization, and the increasing imperative for teachers to be reflexive practitioners. Using Ulrich Beck’s theory of reflexive modernization provides a framework that can link these  <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> identities with globalization, modernization and emergent risk societies.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} 28 preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 involvment in a ten-week long e-mail project linking them with elementary {{students in a}} mathematical problem solving activity. <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> sent mathematical problems each week to their student groups via e-mail. The elementary students solved the problems and responded with their solution and an explanation of their process. Of the college students, three preservice teachers {{with high levels of}} mathematics anxiety and three with low levels of anxiety were selected to be examined in case studies. Interviews with the case study participants, as well as data collected from all of the class members, provided insight into their perceptions of the e-mail activity;Results showed that the overall quality of the problems sent by <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> to their student groups increased as they learned about the skills of their elementary partners. They were very concerned about choosing problems at the appropriate difficulty level for their students, and cited good explanations of the problem solving process by the elementary students as being a key to their understanding. When poor explanations were provided by the elementary students, <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 impressions of the e-mail activity were less favorable overall;The preservice teachers rated a set of problems more consistently with the participating teachers {{at the end of the}} e-mail activity than they did at the beginning, showing their understanding of what was appropriate for their student groups. However, the problems selected by <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were not completely consistent with their beliefs of what good problems should entail. Mathematical anxiety levels had some influence on these inconsistencies, but anxiety levels had a smaller effect on participation than was anticipated;Myers 2 ̆ 7 (1993) criteria for determining the authenticity of an activity demonstrated the potential of electronic links to make a favorable impact in teacher preparation programs. For this reason, benefits and limitations to using telecommunications in preservice teacher preparation programs were explored...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Natal, 1999. Preservice {{teachers}} {{have had a}} twelve year "apprenticeship of observation" {{in the practice of}} teaching and as a consequence have internalised a set of beliefs about Mathematics teaching and learning. These beliefs are usually implicit but nevertheless influence the teaching practice of <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> {{to the extent that they}} "teach as they were taught. " A preservice Mathematics Education course, falling as it does between the prospective teachers' experiences as scholars, and their future teaching experience provides an ideal opportunity for preservice teachers to review their personal beliefs prior to carrying them over to teaching practice. In order to facilitate this review, a series of activities was designed as part of a Mathematics Education course for preservice secondary phase Mathematics teachers. These activities provided opportunities for student teachers to examine their beliefs, to discuss and write about these beliefs, to read about the beliefs of others, and finally to decide whether they wished to retain or modify their personal beliefs. Data on the personal theories of <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> was obtained from the written responses to various critical incidents, from metaphors for the teaching and learning of Mathematics drawn and described by <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers,</b> and from interviews with selected participants. These theories were classified into qualitatively different categories. After completing several developmental activities and a five week period of classroom teaching, <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were invited to reconsider their personal theories and amend their metaphors. This provided evidence of reflection and development in their thinking. It is contended that the personal theories of preservice teachers are not only reflected in their classroom practice but also function as barriers to impede acceptance of novel ideas and innovations. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the thinking of preservice teachers and inform the development of a curriculum for the Mathematics Education component of a Professional Studies course...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{early childhood education}} (ECE) (PreK- 3) preservice teachers ’ ideas about science education change {{as a result of}} implementing an inquiry-based curriculum within an ECE science methods course (ten-week quarter). Fifty-two preservice teachers, including 50 females and 2 males, with 2 members of an ethnic minority group were part of the study. <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> ’ knowledge and understanding of how to implement inquiry learning deepened over the ten-week period. <b>The</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> seemed to gain some confidence in implementing inquiry learning. Preservice teachers need to have focused science teaching time with primary students to strengthen and support their confidence, attitudes, and abilities to implement inquiry learning. Also, support for inquiry learning must come from K- 12 educators as well as arts and science faculty, as this is where preservice teachers can develop substantive content knowledge within authentic science learning experiences...|$|E

40|$|A strong {{foundation}} in mathematics {{as a science}} of thinking may lead to an improved performance in chemistry. The study investigated attitudes towards mathematics as predictors of preservice teachers' achievement in senior secondary school chemistry among 325 Nigerian <b>preservice</b> chemistry <b>teachers</b> from two public universities in Lagos State, Nigeria using the quantitative research method within the blueprint of descriptive survey design of an expost facto type. Data collected were analysed using the descriptive statistics of mean, and standard deviation and inferential statistics of independent samples t-test, Pearson product moment correlation, analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed that gender differences in attitudes towards mathematics and dimensions of attitudes towards mathematics among <b>preservice</b> chemistry <b>teachers</b> were at a zero-tolerance level while grade level of <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> chemistry <b>teachers</b> {{was a factor in}} their attitudes towards mathematics. Grade level, gender and value in mathematics made statistically significant contributions to <b>the</b> variance in <b>preservice</b> teachers' achievement in senior secondary school chemistry. Based on the results of this study, it was recommended that chemistry teacher educators should emphasise the connec-tions between chemistry and mathematics for effective learning at <b>the</b> <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> level...|$|R
