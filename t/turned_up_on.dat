Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering them straight into the secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E

5|$|Best was {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.|$|E

Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to buy a Hofner president bass guitar and join The Quarrymen.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Eugénie hat {{was named}} after Eugénie de Montijo, wife of Napoleon III, whose fashion choices were publicised in fashion sketches and closely scrutinised across Europe and the United States. The design became popular in the 1850s and 1860s, when it was {{also known as the}} empress hat. It was characterised by its forward tilt and featured feathers and ribbons. Typically it was made of velvet or felt. Mary Brooks Picken noted that the hat was generally small in its original incarnation, often with the brim <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> one or both sides, with what were generally ostrich feathers as a trim. It would normally be tilted towards the right. Originally, the hat was worn for horseriding and travelling.|$|E

Rock was perhaps the last person {{in the music industry}} with whom Barrett kept in contact.

500|$|In Washington state, {{investigators}} were {{still struggling to}} analyze the Pacific Northwest murder spree that had ended as abruptly as it had begun. In {{an effort to make}} sense of an overwhelming mass of data, they resorted to the then-innovative strategy of compiling a database. They used the King County payroll computer, a [...] "huge, primitive machine" [...] by contemporary standards, but the only one available for their use. After inputting the many lists they had compiled—classmates and acquaintances of each victim, Volkswagen owners named [...] "Ted", known sex offenders, and so on—they queried the computer for coincidences. Out of thousands of names, 26 <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> four separate lists; one was Ted Bundy.

500|$|Stern phoned Bill Harry at his Mersey Beat {{newspaper}} {{and asked if}} he could arrange a photograph of all the groups in Liverpool, so Harry suggested Kirchherr be the photographer, although Kirchherr later said she placed an advertisement in the Liverpool Echo newspaper. Kirchherr and Scheler said that any group who wanted their photograph taken in front of St. George's Hall would be paid £1 per musician, but over 200 groups <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the day, which meant Kirchherr and Scheler soon ran out of money. Kirchherr didn't publish the photographs until 1995, in a book called Liverpool Days, which is a limited-edition collection of black-and-white photographs. In 1999, a companion book called Hamburg Days was published (a two-volume limited edition), containing a set of photographs by Kirchherr and [...] "memory drawings" [...] by Voormann. The drawings are recollections of places and situations that Voormann clearly remembers, but Kirchherr had never photographed, or had lost the photographs.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Steiger {{portrayed the}} comic actor W. C. Fields in an Arthur Hiller biopic, W. C. Fields and Me, for Universal Pictures. The screenplay, {{which was based}} on a memoir by Carlotta Monti, who was Fields' mistress for the last 14 years of his life, was penned by Bob Merrill. Steiger read extensively about Fields in preparation for the role, and developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of his career and personal life. He concluded that he would base his characterization around his performance in The Bank Dick (1940) [...] One day, Fields' mistress Monti <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> set, and watched the scene where he briefly thanks everybody. Nervous that she might not approve, he broke down in tears after Monti met him after the scene and fondly said [...] "Woody, Woody, Woody, My Woody", a nickname used only by those very close to Fields. Despite the energy Steiger put into the picture, like the actor's previous recent films, it was poorly received by critics. Canby called it [...] "dreadful" [...] and described Steiger's portrayal of Fields as a [...] "wax dummy of a character". Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times later referred to Steiger's portrayal of Fields as [...] "superb", but noted that his Hollywood career had [...] "undeniably fallen from his 1950s and '60s heights".|$|E
500|$|The {{obscenity}} {{trial began}} on 9 November 1928. Cape's solicitor Harold Rubinstein sent out 160 letters to potential witnesses. Many {{were reluctant to}} appear in court; according to Virginia Woolf, [...] "they generally put {{it down to the}} weak heart of a father, or a cousin who is about to have twins". About 40 <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the day of the trial, including Woolf herself, Forster, and such diverse figures as biologist Julian Huxley, Laurence Housman of the British Sexological Society, Robert Cust JP of the London Morality Council, Charles Ricketts of the Royal Academy of Art and Rabbi Joseph Frederick Stern of the East London Synagogue. Norman Haire, who was the star witness after Havelock Ellis bowed out, declared that homosexuality ran in families and a person could no more become it by reading books than if he could become syphilitic by reading about syphilis. None were allowed to offer their views of the novel. Under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron could decide whether the book was obscene without hearing any testimony on the question. [...] "I don't think people are entitled to express an opinion upon a matter which is the decision of the court," [...] he said. Since Hall herself was not on trial, she did {{not have the right to}} her own counsel, and Cape's barrister Norman Birkett had persuaded her not to take the stand herself.|$|E
