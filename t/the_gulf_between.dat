However, <b>the</b> <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> Arsenal and the {{professional}} sides from the North soon became apparent, and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer; after Derby County had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891, they attempted to sign two of Arsenal's amateur players on professional contracts.|$|E

5000|$|Sulawesi, {{formerly}} known as Celebes ( [...] or [...] ), is an island in Indonesia. One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's eleventh-largest island, it is situated east of Borneo, west of the Maluku Islands, and south of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra have larger populations.The landmass of Sulawesi includes four peninsulas: the northern Minahasa Peninsula; the East Peninsula; the South Peninsula; and the South-east Peninsula. Three gulfs separate these peninsulas: <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Tomini <b>between</b> <b>the</b> northern Minahasa and East peninsulas; <b>the</b> Tolo <b>Gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> East and Southeast peninsulas; and <b>the</b> Bone <b>Gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> South and Southeast peninsulas.

25|$|Man, {{according}} to Schopenhauer, {{is driven by}} continued, unachievable desires, and <b>the</b> <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> our desires {{and the possibility of}} achieving them leads to misery while the world is a representation of an unknowable reality. Our representation of the world is Phenomenon, while the unknowable reality is Noumenon: concepts originally posited by Kant. Schopenhauer's influence on Tristan und Isolde is most evident {{in the second and third}} acts. The second act, in which the lovers meet, and the third act, during which Tristan longs for release from the passions that torment him, have often proved puzzling to opera-goers unfamiliar with Schopenhauer's work.|$|E
25|$|Louis XVI and {{his family}} fled Paris on 21 June 1791, but were {{captured}} in Varennes and brought back to Paris on 25 June. Hostility grew within Paris between the liberal aristocrats and merchants, who wanted a constitutional monarchy, and the more radical sans-culottes from the working-class and poor neighbourhoods, who wanted a republic and {{the abolition of the}} Ancien Régime, including the privileged classes: the aristocracy and the Church. Aristocrats continued to leave Paris for safety in the countryside or abroad. On 17 July 1791, the National Guard fired upon a gathering of petitioners on the Champs de Mars, killing dozens and widening <b>the</b> <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> the more moderate and more radical revolutionaries.|$|E

25|$|As the 20th century entered {{its final}} third, {{it was already}} {{apparent}} to chess historians and enthusiasts that the USSR had raised standards to a level to which other nations could only aspire. The USSR had produced an uninterrupted line of world champions stretching from 1948 to 1970. Since its earliest participation, the USSR had completely dominated team chess {{events such as the}} Chess Olympiad and European Team Championship. So pronounced was <b>the</b> <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> the Soviet national side and their closest competitors, a sterner challenge was required to gauge the full extent of their supremacy. Such a challenge presented itself in 1970, when Max Euwe (the president of FIDE at the time) announced a match to pit the USSR's strength against the collective might {{of the rest of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} tourism has had social and {{economic}} repercussions. This led to speculation {{of the emergence of}} a two-tier economy and the fostering of a state of tourist apartheid. This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) {{on the one hand and}} the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods – and even some of local manufacture, such as rum and coffee – could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened <b>the</b> <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term socialist policies.|$|E
