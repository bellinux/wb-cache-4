By extending the range of accessible length scales to less <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of microns we gain access to a regime where strong coupling's effects are predicted yet largely untested. To this effort, high resolution optical systems were designed, bench tested and implemented for sculpting and imaging ultracold neutral plasmas. Many complications and unexpected effects were documented to assist future experimental design considerations, including, those due to saturation and optical thickness, both of which limit the utility of 461 nm push beam modulations. It was concluded that sculpting should be performed on the 412 nm ionizing beam and real-time density space analysis is reliable for spatial frequencies up to 5 cyc/mm by using 4 X magnified imaging. Higher spatial frequencies benefit from velocity space analysis due to extremely fast dynamics and low intensity levels...|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} {{radiative}} transfer simulation we study {{the evolution of}} the far-infrared colours of protoplanetary discs undergoing inside-out dispersal, often referred to as transition discs. We show that a brightening of the mid and far-infrared emission from these objects is a natural consequence of the removal of the inner disc. Our results can fully explain recent observations of transition discs in the Chamaleon and Lupus star forming regions from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey, which show a higher median for the 70 ?um (Herschel PACS 1) band of known transition objects compared with primordial discs. Our theoretical results hence support the suggestion that the 70 ?um band may be a powerful diagnostic for the identification of transition discs from photometry data, provided that the inner hole is larger <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of AU, depending on spectral type. Furthermore we show that a comparison of photometry in the K, 12 ?um and 7 u 0 ?m bands to model tracks can provide a rough, but quick estimate of the inner hole size of these objects, provided their inclination is below ? 85 degrees and the inner hole size is again larger <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of AU.

50|$|What {{has been}} lacking {{has been the}} paleontological {{evidence}} that early humans consumed fish in significant amounts earlier <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> {{to hundreds of thousands}} of years ago. Part of the problem has been the avoidance of taphonomic bias by researchers: most hominin fossils occur in marginal lacustrine environments and the presence of fish remains is therefore no proof of fish consumption. Fish bones often decompose so that special tests are required to detect them. The archaeological record of human fishing and coastal settlement is fundamentally flawed due to postglacial sea level rise.|$|R
