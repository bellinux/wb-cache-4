5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Completion</b> Force sailed on 10February 1945 and was sighted leaving port by a Royal Navy submarine.

As regularity of a (linear) context-free language is not decidable, the question arose whether regularity of a hairpin completion of regular languages is decidable. We prove that this problem is decidable and we provide a polynomial time algorithm. Furthermore, we prove that <b>the</b> hairpin <b>completion</b> of regular languages is an unambiguous linear context-free language and, as such, it has an effectively computable growth function. Moreover, we show that the growth of <b>the</b> hairpin <b>completion</b> is exponential if and only if the growth of the underlying languages is exponential and, in case <b>the</b> hairpin <b>completion</b> is regular, then <b>the</b> hairpin <b>completion</b> and <b>the</b> underlying languages have the same growth indicator...|$|R
