40|$|Abstract We {{introduce}} {{and discuss}} preliminary experience with an application that has vast potential {{to exploit the}} Grid for social benefit and offers interesting resource assessment and allocation challenges, having real-time aspects: image registration. Image registration is generally formulated as an optimization problem that satisfies constraints, such as coordinate displacements that are affine or volumepreserving or that obey the laws of elasticity. Three-dimensional registration of high-resolution images is computationally complex and justifies parallel implementation. In turn, ensembles of registration tasks exploit concurrency in the simpler sense of job farming. Registration is an elementary example {{of a much larger}} class of large-scale mesh-based computations that are in principle amenable to execution on the Grid, but are sensitive to workload-to-capability balance at synchronization points. While better resource assessment and allocation <b>tools</b> <b>lift</b> all such applications, reducing sensitivity to synchronization within an individual application is also important. We therefore examine the potential for weakening the synchronization sensitivity of general mesh-based bulk synchronous computations through less restrictive programming paradigms.

40|$|Abstract- Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a unconventional machining {{process for the}} machining of complex shapes and hard materials that are difficult of machining by conventional machining process. In this paper deals with the optimization of EDM process parameters using the grey relational analysis (GRA) based on an orthogonal array for the multi response process. The experiments are conducted on Titanium super alloys with copper electrode based on the Taguchi design of experiments L 27 orthogonal array by choosing various parameters such as peak current, pulse on time, pulse off time and <b>tool</b> <b>lift</b> time for EDM process to obtain multiple process responses namely Metal removal rate (MRR) and Tool Wear Rate (TWR). The combination of Taguchi method with GRA enables to determine the optimal parameters for multiple response process.

40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} the effectiveness of machining time of 5 -axis miling is the method being used. By using flank milling method, {{as one of the}} optimized processes to make a workpiece, the time required for the process becomes shorter. This research is aimed at developing the method for determining the initial orientation of the tool for a sculptured surface on the basis of faceted model. By determining cc-point as the basis for positioning the tool {{on the surface of the}} workpiece, the cutting direction is formed from the nearest cc-point in the XY flat plane direction of the faceted model at the spatial coordinate. The positioning of the tool is initially based on the Local Coordinate System developed by the cross product between the normal vector nat each cc-point and cutting direction vector Ffrom one cc-point to the other. The cross product resulted is a tangent vector Tof the plane formed from the normal vector and cutting direction. The orientation of the tool is formed and defined by an inclination angle (α) and a screw angle (β). Maximizing the cutting volume and avoiding gouging at each cc-point during the flank milling are carried out through optimal adjustment of these two rotational angles. Furthermore, when the adjustment of rotational angles cannot resolve the gouging, appropriate <b>tool</b> <b>lifting</b> along the normal vector is conductedhis method is very much applicable for flank milling having the basis of data in the form of faceted models...|$|R

40|$|The {{segmentation}} of {{the primary}} mirror is the only promising solution for building {{the next generation of}} ground telescopes. However, manufacturing segmented mirrors presents its own challenges. The edge mis-figure impacts directly on the telescope’s scientific output. The ‘Edge effect’ significantly dominates the polishing precision. Therefore, the edge control is {{regarded as one of the}} most difficult technical issues in the segment production that needs to be addressed urgently. This paper reports an active edge control technique for the mirror segments fabrication using the Precession's polishing technique. The strategy in this technique requires that the large spot be selected on the bulk area for fast polishing, and the small spot is used for edge figuring. This can be performed by <b>tool</b> <b>lift</b> and optimizing the dell time to compensate for non-uniform material removal at the edge zone. This requires accurate and stable edge tool influence functions. To obtain the full tool influence function at the edge, we have demonstrated in previous work a novel hybrid-measurement method which uses both simultaneous phase interferometry and profilometry. In this paper, the edge effect under ‘Bonnet tool’ polishing is investigated. The pressure distribution is analyzed by means of finite element analysis (FEA). According to the ‘Preston’ equation, the shape of the edge tool influence functions is predicted. With this help, the multiple process parameters at the edge zone are optimized. This is demonstrated on a 200 mm cross-corners hexagonal part with a result of PV less than 200 nm for entire surface...|$|R
