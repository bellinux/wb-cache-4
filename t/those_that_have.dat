5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12.

5|$|In captivity, females become {{sexually mature}} at {{two months of}} age. The ovarian {{follicle}} forms about 16 days prior {{to the birth of}} the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.|$|E

Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as {{they do not need}} to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E

5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
5|$|Colts are {{assessed}} in their two-year-old {{year by the}} New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions; any animal failing the assessment must be gelded. Once approved, every spring (usually in March), the stallions must pass the Verderers' assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed. The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the ponies running out on the New Forest, and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest-run ponies, the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project, which will use hardy Forest-run mares, mostly over eleven years old, bred to stallions {{that have not been}} run out on the Forest, or closely related to <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
