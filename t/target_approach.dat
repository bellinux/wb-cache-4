40|$|Many {{countries}} {{in the developing world}} have adopted an approach to monetary policy that focuses on maintaining a low level of inflation, to the exclusion of other important objectives such as employment generation, increasing investment or reducing poverty, despite the widespread evidence that moderate levels of inflation have few or no costs. Some have even adopted formal “inflation targeting”, an approach which commits the central bank to hitting a fairly rigid inflation target, often as low as 2 %. However, this focus has led to slower economic growth and lower employment growth, without succeeding in lowering inflation at a smaller economic cost than traditional methods of inflation fighting. Clearly, it is time to find an alternative to inflation targeting. This paper presents the real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach</b> to monetary policy, which I argue is superior alternative to the costly and ineffective inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>approach.</b> Under this real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach,</b> central banks are given a country appropriate target such as employment growth, unemployment, real GDP or investment, usually subject to an inflation constraint. Given these two targets – the real target and the constraint – the central bank will find multiple tools to reach these targets, designing new tools and rediscovering old tools such as asset based reserve requirements and other credit allocation techniques. The real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach</b> might also be complemented by other policies, such as capital management techniques to deal with possible capital flight. The real <b>targeting</b> <b>approach</b> has the potential to make central bank policy more transparent, more accountable, and more socially useful than most currently existing central bank structures. ...|$|R

5000|$|British {{pilots who}} tested a {{captured}} Bf 109 E-3 liked {{the engine and}} throttle response, the docile and responsive handling and stall characteristics at low speeds, but criticised the high-speed handling characteristics (in {{part due to the}} automatic wing slats opening), poorer turning circle (850 ft as opposed to 680 ft for the Spitfire), and great control forces required at speed (in part because of rudder pedal position and a lack of trim tabs). In August 1940, comparative trials were held at the Erprobungsstelle Rechlin central Luftwaffe air test facility, with the leading Luftwaffe ace Werner Mölders being one of the participants. The tests concluded that the Bf 109 had superior level and climb speed to the Spitfire and Hurricane at all altitudes, but also noted the significantly smaller turning circle of the British fighters (more than one British pilots combat reports bear this out, having used the tighter turning circle of their aircraft to get into firing position, or conversely used it {{to get out of the}} way of a 109). It was advised not to engage in turning dogfights unless the performance advantage of the Bf 109 could be used to full effect. The roll rate of the Bf 109 was deemed superior, as was its stability on <b>target</b> <b>approach.</b> Mölders himself called the Spitfire [...] "miserable as a fighting aircraft", due to its two-pitch propeller and the inability of its carburettor to handle negative g-forces. His complaint regarding the propeller was that with one setting selected the pilot was at risk of over-revving and stressing the engine, but conversely, selecting the other setting meant the aircraft could not run at its best (a situation roughly analogous to a car having too much of a gap between transmission ratios) It should be noted, however, that in the political climate of the times there was often a considerable amount of propaganda written into such reports by both sides or the information quickly become outdated; for example, as a result of a crash programme, all Spitfires and Hurricanes were retrofitted with either Rotol or Hamilton constant-speed propellers by 16 August 1940.|$|E

The goal was to obtain conjugates which retained the maximum antigen recognition features and that produced the highest fluorescence intensities. We found that only amine <b>targeted</b> <b>approach</b> could produce higher dye per antibody variants (> 3) with a maximum yield of antibody conjugates. Sulfhydryl and carbohydrate <b>targeted</b> <b>approaches</b> are site-specific, however, they led to the generation of low amount of functional dye-antibody conjugates.

We wanted to demonstrate the relationship of CD 1 d with peptide antigen presenters i. e. major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the cell surface.

In particular the automatic pre-analysis of reconnaissance data is important for the human observer as well as for autonomous systems. In the phase of <b>target</b> <b>approach</b> fully automatic methods are needed for the recognition of predefined objects. For this purpose appropriate sensors are used like imaging IR sensors suitable for day/night operation and laser radar supplying 3 D information of the scenario. Classical methods for target recognition based on comparison with synthetic IR object models imply certain shortcomings, e. g. unknown weather conditions and the engine status of vehicles. We propose a concept of generating efficient 2 D templates for IR target signatures based on the evaluation of a precise 3 D model of the target generated from real multisensor data.
