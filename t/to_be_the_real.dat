5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{returns to}} the {{research}} center, where she finds a body of James Pierce and a mummified remains of Ridley. She also discovers the survivor, and defeats a Queen Metroid. Samus pursues the survivor, who reveals herself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Madeline. Madeline explains that the woman Samus met earlier was MB, an android created to establish {{a relationship with the}} Metroids. Betrayed by scientists and Madeline, MB telepathically commanded the Space Pirate special forces to attack those on board. Samus and Madeline are confronted by MB; as a group of Federation troopers rushes into the room, MB summons the Bottle Ship's most dangerous creatures to attack everyone. Madeline stops MB, who is then destroyed by Federation troopers. The colonel compliments Samus's efforts but orders a trooper to escort Samus back to her ship; a trooper complies and reveals himself as Anthony, the only surviving member of the 07th Platoon. Samus, Madeline and Anthony leave for the Galactic Federation headquarters in Samus's gunship. Days after the incident, Samus {{returns to the}} Bottle Ship, now marked for destruction by the Galactic Federation, to retrieve something that is left there. After battling Phantoon, a monster Samus had also fought on Zebes, she arrives at the control center and recovers Adam's platoon helmet. The Bottle Ship's self-destruct sequence is remotely activated, which an armorless Samus escapes with Adam's helmet.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dynamical}} {{system is}} a manifold M called the phase (or state) space endowed with a family of smooth evolution functions Φt that for any element of t ∈ T, the time, map a point of the phase space back into the phase space.

25|$|Peppino Impastato used {{humor and}} satire as his weapon against the Mafia. In his popular daily radio {{programme}} Onda pazza (Crazy Wave) he mocked politicians and mafiosi alike.

Gustav III paid her debts with the condition that she established her own separate court at Fredrikshof Palace. In 1777, she was forced to sell Drottningholm Palace to her son Gustav.|$|E

AppTrigger wrote that though Sonic Mania brought the series back to its 2D roots, it also brought problems with 1990s 2D platformers. VideoGamer.com wrote that the game relied too much on nostalgia, with minimal innovation and too few original stages, but was a good proof of concept that the development team could expand upon. The PC version on Steam received criticism for its implementation of the digital rights management (DRM) software Denuvo, which some thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> reason behind the two-week delay.

Nonetheless, Dynamo Kyiv is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the miners history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, Nevio Scala, who managed to secure the Ukrainian Cup title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players has become particularly acute and brought a series of court cases.

25|$|Thomas Hayne Cutbush (1865–1903) was {{a medical}} student sent to Lambeth Infirmary in 1891 {{suffering}} delusions {{thought to have been}} caused by syphilis. After stabbing a woman in the backside and attempting to stab a second he was pronounced insane and committed to Broadmoor Hospital in 1891, where he remained until his death in 1903. In a series of articles in 1894, The Sun newspaper suggested that Cutbush was the Ripper. There is no evidence that police took the idea seriously, and Melville Macnaghten's memorandum naming the three police suspects Druitt, Kosminski and Ostrog was written to refute the idea that Cutbush was the Ripper. Cutbush was the suspect advanced in the 1993 book Jack the Myth by A. P. Wolf, who suggested that Macnaghten wrote his memo to protect Cutbush's uncle, a fellow police officer. Another recent writer, Peter Hodgson, considers Cutbush the most likely candidate. David Bullock also firmly believes Cutbush <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> ripper in his book.|$|E
