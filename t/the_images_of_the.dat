5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
5|$|In Edgbaston, Tolkien {{lived there}} {{in the shadow of}} Perrott's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston Waterworks, which may have {{influenced}} <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark towers within his works. Another strong influence was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery had a large collection of works on public display.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E

5|$|The {{images of}} Uttararama follow a {{different}} style from <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to {{a certain amount of}} dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the images have been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. This code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddha.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|In Matsya Purana, Shiva {{had created}} seven Matrikas {{to combat the}} demon Andhaka, who {{had the ability to}} {{duplicate}} from each drop of his blood that falls from him when he is wounded. The Matrikas drink up his blood and help Shiva defeat the demon. After the battle, the Matrikas begin a rampage of destruction by starting to devour other gods, demons and peoples of the world. Narasimha, Vishnu's man-lion incarnation, creates a host of thirty-two benign goddesses who calm down the terrible, fire-breathing Matrikas. Narasimha commanded the Matrikas to protect the world, instead of destroying it and thus be worshipped by mankind. At the end of the episode, Shiva's terrible form Bhairava is enshrined with <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Matrikas at the place where the battle took place. This story is retold in Vishnudharmottara Purana. Vishnudharmottara Purana further relates them with vices or inauspicious emotions like envy, pride, anger etc.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{and his son}} Diadumenianus were {{declared}} hostes, {{enemies of}} the state, by the Senate immediately after news had arrived of their deaths {{and as part of}} an official declaration of support for the usurper Elagabalus, who was recognized in the Senate as the new Emperor. The declaration of hostes led to two actions being taken against <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Emperors. First, their portraits were destroyed and their names were stricken from inscriptions and papyrii. The second action, taken by the Roman soldiers who had rebelled against Macrinus in favour of Elagabalus, was to destroy all of the works and possessions of Macrinus. The damnatio memoriae against Macrinus is among the earliest of such sanctions enacted by the Senate. Many of the marble busts of Macrinus that exist were defaced and mutilated {{as a response to the}} damnatio memoriae and many of the coins depicting Macrinus and Diadumenianus were also destroyed. These actions against Macrinus are evidence of his unpopularity in Rome.|$|E

5|$|The carvings are {{all based}} on popular series of engravings, which were often {{published}} in pattern books. Nuremberg was the origin of numerous such books, and one may {{have been brought to}} Edzell by the miner Hans Ziegler. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deities are derived from engravings of 1528–29 by the German artist Georg Pencz (or Iorg Bentz, c. 1500–1550), a pupil of Albrecht Dürer; the initials I. B. appear on the carving of Mars. The arts and virtues are both based on engravings derived from paintings by the Flemish artist Marten de Vos. The engravings, by Jan Sadeler and Crispijn de Passe, were widely distributed in Scotland, along with those of the deities. Indeed, the image of Prudence is identical to that used by the King's Master of Works William Schaw, in the spectacular display to welcome Queen Anne to Scotland, following her marriage to James VI in 1589.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{power of the}} Sogdians never recovered. Subsequently, Sogdiana formed part of the Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a breakaway state from the Seleucid Empire founded in 248 BC by Diodotus I, for roughly a century. Euthydemus I, a former satrap of Sogdiana, seems to have held the Sogdian territory as a rival claimant to the Greco-Bactrian throne; his coins were later copied locally and bore Aramaic inscriptions. The Greco-Bactrian king Eucratides I may have recovered sovereignty of Sogdia temporarily. Finally the area was occupied by nomads when the Scythians and Yuezhis overran it around 145 BC. From then until about 40 BC the Yuezhi tepidly minted coins imitating and still bearing <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greco-Bactrian kings Eucratides I and Heliocles I, yet soon afterwards they began minting unique coins bearing the faces of their own rulers {{as a prelude to}} asserting themselves as a world power under the Kushan Empire.|$|E
5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, turning on the right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} {{using two}} intersecting circles is proposed as a linear approach for determining a camera's intrinsic parameters. The two intersecting coplanar circles have four intersection {{points in the}} projective plane: two real points and two circular points. In <b>the</b> <b>image</b> plane, <b>the</b> diagonal triangle - on which <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four intersection points composes a complete quadrangle - is a self-polar triangle for <b>the</b> projection curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles. <b>The</b> vertex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-polar triangle is <b>the</b> null space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degenerate conic formed by <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four intersection points. By solving <b>the</b> three vertices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-polar triangle using <b>the</b> <b>image</b> coordinates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two real intersection points, the degenerate conic can be obtained. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two circular points is then computed from <b>the</b> intersection points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degenerate conic.
