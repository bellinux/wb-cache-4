The dispersing pilot pattern and the method of channel estimation using in MIMO-OFDM system couldn’t eliminate the same frequency interference caused by the OFDM frequency among different <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antenna</b> couples. Aiming at these problems, we proposed a method of MIMO-OFDM channel estimation combining orthogonal pilot design. The data format of pilot is designed.

This method proposed in the paper has finished the design of the completely orthogonal pilot data symbol among the different subcarriers position of different transmittingreceiving antenna pair. And the pilot data symbols are distributed in the entire time-frequency grid of the channel reasonably, therefore this paper uses a FFT unit whose points are equal to the number of the OFDM subcarriers to realize the least-square channel estimation algorithm.

Flat fading channels are also known as amplitude varying channels and narrowband channels as the signal’s bandwidth is narrow compared to channel’s bandwidth [18]. In this narrowband channel model, the channel gain between any pair of <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antennas</b> is modeled as a complex Gaussian random variable. This model relies on two assumptions: (i) the antenna elements in the transmitter and receiver being spatially well separated once the more widely spaced (in wavelengths) the antenna elements, the smaller the spatial channel correlation [19, 20], and (ii) {{the presence of a}} large number of temporally but narrowly separated multipaths (common in a rich-scattering environment), whose combined gain, by the central-limit theorem, can be approximated by a Gaussian random variable [20].|$|R

In this paper, {{the concept of a}} layered super-orthogonal turbo transmit diversity (SOTTD) for downlink direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems is explored. This open-loop transmit diversity technique improves the downlink performance by using a small number of antenna elements at the base station and a single antenna at the handset. In the proposed technique, low-rate super-orthogonal code-spread CDMA is married with code-division transmit diversity (CDTD). At the mobile receiver, space-time (ST) RAKE CDTD processing is combined with iterative turbo code-spread decoding to yield large ST gains. The performance of the SOTTD system is compared with single- and multiantenna turbo-coded (TC) CDTD systems evaluated over a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel. The evaluation is done both by means of analysis and computer simulations. The performance results illustrate the superior performance of SOTTD compared to TC CDTD systems over practically the complete useful capacity range of CDMA. It is shown that the performance degradation characteristic of TC CDTD at low system loads (due to the inherent TC error floor) is alleviated by the SOTTD system.|$|R

We consider a message-passing backhaul network architecture, in which nearby sectors can exchange already decoded messages and propose an alignment solution that can achieve the optimal DoFs. To avoid signaling schemes relying on the strength of interference, we further introduce the notion of topologically robust schemes, which are able to guarantee a minimum rate (or DoFs) irrespectively of the strength of the interfering links.

40|$|Compact, {{cost-efficient}} and high-resolution imaging sensors {{are especially}} desirable {{in the field}} of short-range observation and surveillance. Such sensors are of great value in fields of security, rescue and medical applications. Systems can be formed for various practical purposes, such as detecting concealed weapons in public places, locating people inside buildings or beneath rubbles during emergency rescue, detecting landmine with small vehicle-based systems, and finding early-stage lesions inside human bodies. The advantage of such systems is that imaging can be achieved in real-time, which allows for safer and more effective operation as well as intelligence gathering. In order to observe moving targets, the system must operate quickly enough to generate a focused real-time 3 -D image. Cost efficiency is another factor to consider for market reasons. Existing systems based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology or array with sequential operation of identical transceiver pairs are costly, thus commercially difficult to be widely deployed. Their drawbacks are obvious when compared with compact, lightweight and high-resolution imaging systems which can provide real-time perception of the target. The combination of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology and real-aperture multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array offers a novel and practical solution for safe, reliable and cost-efficient imaging sensors with high resolution capability. UWB impulse with high fractional bandwidth controls the appearance of grating lobes caused by the sparsity of the array; while asymmetric transmit and receive arrays further reduce the number of required antenna elements within the array aperture. Compared to the conventional SAR systems, the combined advantages of UWB technology and MIMO technique can drastically reduce element density, data-acquisition time and the system costs. The development of UWB-MIMO array and related imaging algorithms is an important and novel research subject. The International Research Centre for Telecommunications and Radar (IRCTR) of Delft University of Technology has initiated several projects with the purpose to develop high performance array-based UWB imaging systems for different short-range applications. Under this framework, my research has achieved the following novelties and main results which are elaborated in the thesis: Properties of UWB focusing. A novel theory of ultra-wideband focusing is proposed, which has corrected the previous misunderstanding of the impact of bandwidth on imaging. The proposed theory shows that sparsity only ensures the existence of a grating lobe free region within the image space rather than the complete absence of grating lobes. Instead, the bandwidth relative to the center frequency, or fractional bandwidth, has deterministic impact on the formation of grating lobes. Specifically, the bandwidth of an imaging system must exceed its central frequency in order to benefit from the merit of wideband impulse properties, allowing high-resolution imaging with significantly reduced number of antenna elements. The proposed theory helps to resolve the dilemma between angular resolution and grating lobe level for a sparse aperture/array. MIMO array topology design. Novel design approaches for one-dimensional and two-dimensional MIMO arrays have been proposed. They allow direct formation of array topologies without the need of numerical optimization. The designed arrays following the proposed strategies are able to provide three-dimensional imaging capabilities and low grating/side lobe level with large element spacing and minimum number of antenna elements. Combination of UWB technology and MIMO array technique. It is demonstrated that the combination of UWB and MIMO array is a beneficial concept for microwave imaging systems. The MIMO array-based UWB imaging system is able to provide high down- and cross-range resolution, low side/grating lobe level, simplified RF scheme and significantly increased data acquisition speed. A procedure for designing UWB-MIMO array for short-range imaging has been formulated. The process translates requirements from the application into specific array specifications, such as operational frequency band, number of elements needed, aperture dimension, and array topology. Modified Kirchhoff migration for MIMO configuration. Modified Kirchhoff migration has been developed for both free-space and subsurface imaging. The modifications allow for extension of the classical Kirchhoff algorithm, which is based on the exploding reflector concept and is formulated for co-located <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antennas,</b> to multistatic imaging with arbitrary positions of transmit and receive antennas. The algorithm combines the high quality imaging performance with acceptable computational costs, thus can be applied to demanding applications in practice. Range migration algorithm for MIMO configuration. Range migration algorithm is formulated for multistatic array configuration in the frequency-wavenumber domain for near-field imaging. By taking advantage of the computation efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT), imaging speed of MIMO array-based system are significantly increased while maintaining high-quality imaging capabilities. Demonstration of UWB-MIMO system in different applications. Within the framework of several European projects, prototypes of MIMO array-based UWB imaging systems were designed and implemented for through-wall imaging (PROBANT), ground penetrating radar (Cadmium), and concealed weapon detection (RADIOTECT, ATOM). The feasibility of operational systems under various practical circumstances has been demonstrated.

Many channel estimation algorithms developed for either SISO or MIMO-OFDM systems, for example, [20 – 22], can be used to perform channel estimation. The statistics of these RVs are used to derive the degradation in the receive SINR and the BER.

40|$|A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{communication}} network {{consists of a}} set of multi-antenna transmitters and receivers that communicate over a common noisy medium. Each transmitter has access to a set of messages, each of which it needs to deliver to one of the receivers. Since the transmitter(s) transmit multiple messages over such networks, each receiver encounters interference due to undesired transmissions. This interference seen by the receivers is, in fact, the main factor that limits the capacity regions of such networks. Hence, to attain high data-rates, efficient interference management is crucial, and for the same reason, these networks are also known as interference networks. A common and by far the most important MIMO interference network is a wireless cellular network. A wireless signal after its transmission undergoes attenuation or fading. The set of all channel fading coefficients between different pairs of <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antennas</b> is called the channel state. If this channel state is known to all terminals of the network, sophisticated interference management schemes can be implemented to achieve high data-rates. While, in practice, channel state information (CSI) can be obtained at the receivers via pilot transmissions, there is no natural way for acquiring CSI at transmitters (CSIT). Unfortunately, the lack of CSIT severely affects the capacity regions of almost all MIMO networks. To avoid this capacity loss, the next-generation cellular standards are making a provision for having feedback links from the receivers to the transmitters over which the latter can be informed about the channel state. However, due to the dynamic nature of the wireless environment, the channel state is time-varying, which makes it difficult for the transmitters to obtain feedback in a timely manner. Specifically, by the time feedback is available to the transmitters, the channel state may have already changed to a significantly different value. This motivates the study of MIMO interference networks with strictly delayed feedback, which is the main topic of this thesis. We analyze various feedback models depending upon whether the channel state or the channel outputs (i. e., the received signals) or both or a function of the two is fed back. We further consider the worst-case scenario, where the channel state changes independently across time and feedback is available with some delay. Under such a setting, feedback is rather outdated because the information obtained via feedback is completely irrelevant as far as the current channel state is concerned. It may seem here that outdated feedback can not be of much use, which is indeed true for the simplest MIMO network with a single transmitter-receiver pair. Surprisingly, we prove here for the MIMO broadcast channel (BC, a one-to-two, generally, one-to-many system) and for the MIMO interference channel (IC, a system with two transmit-receive pairs) that outdated feedback can significantly improve their capacity regions, relative to the no-feedback case. To obtain such a result, we develop new interference management schemes, wherein each transmitter, using (delayed) feedback, determines and transmits the interference experienced in the past by the receivers. This technique allows a transmitter to deliver useful information to one receiver without creating any additional interference at the others. This point manifests interference alignment, and hence, feedback-based schemes developed in this work are called retrospective interference alignment (RIA) schemes. We then go a step ahead to derive information-theoretic converse arguments, which prove that our RIA schemes are optimal in the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region sense, which provides a first-degree of approximation to the capacity region. Specifically, we characterize here the DoF regions of MIMO broadcast and interference channels under two important settings of (i) delayed CSIT, which involves delayed feedback of the channel state, and (ii) Shannon feedback, which incorporates delayed CSIT as well as channel-output feedback. It is shown that delayed CSIT holds even a DoF benefit over no CSIT. Moreover, for a class of MIMO ICs, characterized by certain relationships on numbers of antennas at different terminals, the entire instantaneous-CSIT DoF region can be achieved with just delayed CSIT, and thus, for these ICs, delays involved in getting CSIT do not result in any loss of DoF. Further, it observed that over the MIMO BC, Shannon feedback is as good as delayed CSIT in the DoF-region sense, which however is not true for the IC. That is, for a class of MIMO ICs, Shannon feedback leads to a DoF improvement, even relative to delayed CSIT. This result is explained intuitively by pointing out that partial transmitter cooperation, induced by Shannon feedback, enables a more efficient form of interference alignment than what is feasible with just delayed CSIT. In addition, these results on delayed CSIT and Shannon feedback are strengthened by identifying scenarios of limited feedback, wherein not all channel fading coefficients and received signals are fed back, but still, the DoF region remains unaltered. As a case in point, for all MIMO BCs and for a large class of MIMO ICs, the DoF region with Shannon feedback is shown to be achievable with just the channel-output feedback. Subsequently, we study a more general class of interference networks which consist of one or more full-duplex terminals that have simultaneous transmission and reception capabilities. These special terminals can aid communication between other transmitters and receivers, and hence, networks with such terminals are called cooperative interference networks. We study two important cooperative networks. The first one, called the layered multi-hop IC, is an IC wherein the transmitters can communicate with the receivers only through the intermediate layers of relays. The second network is termed as the MIMO IC (analogously, BC) with receiver cooperation, where the receivers are assumed to have full-duplex capability so that each of them can also transmit a signal over the same shared medium which is the heard by other receivers. We show, quite contrary to the conclusions available for interference networks, that over both of these cooperative networks, efficient interference alignment schemes can be worked out using the full-duplex terminals, even though the transmitters have no feedback whatsoever. Moreover, these schemes yield an improvement in the DoF region. In particular, it is shown for the layered multi-hop network that having Shannon feedback to the relays obviates the need for having any feedback to the transmitters. This result is proved by developing a DoF-region-optimal retro-cooperative interference alignment (RCIA) scheme, which makes use of partial relay cooperation induced by Shannon feedback. In fact, a complementary conclusion is also derived, where delayed CSIT is proved to render feedback to the relays unnecessary. This result thus shows that even feedback-independent relaying strategies can yield a DoF improvement. Next, on the front of our second cooperative network, it is proved for an important subclass that having receiver cooperation without feedback is as good as having Shannon feedback without receiver cooperation. In fact, a stronger conclusion is also derived, where any form of feedback is shown to be useless, in the presence of receiver cooperation. These results are obtained by proposing RCIA schemes, in which the receivers exchange useful information over cooperative links without creating any additional interference at each other...|$|R

The integrated substrate size could be reduced to 40 cm 2. The analysis of the designed radar is introduced which reflects a good performance and achieves a higher efficiency...|$|E
40|$|V-BLAST (Vertically-layered Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) is a {{multiple}} transmit and receive antenna system that provides very high capacity comparing to single antenna systems. However, most {{research in this}} area had assumed a flat-fading channel environment. This paper considers a frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel environment for multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system. Three different detection techniques with ordered successive interference cancellation are proposed: 1) zero-forcing maximal ratio combining (ZF-MRC), 2) layered maximum likelihood detection (L-MLD) and 3) group maximum likelihood detection (G-MLD). All these schemes considered the delayed elements in each <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antenna</b> pair as imaginary antennas transmitting delayed versions of the substreams. Constraints on the number of receive antennas are also discussed, with G-MLD requiring the least elements. Simulation results show that G-MLD provides the best performance with ZF-MRC performing the worse...|$|E
40|$|Doubly {{selective}} (DS) channel estimation in largescale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{systems is}} a challenging problem {{due to the}} requirement of unaffordable pilot overheads and prohibitive complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed compressive sensing (DCS) based channel estimation scheme to solve this problem. In the scheme, we introduce the basis expansion model (BEM) to reduce the required channel coefficients and pilot overheads. And due to the common sparsity of all the <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antenna</b> pairs in delay domain, we estimate the BEM coefficients by considering the DCS framework, which has a simple linear structure with low complexity. Further more, a linear smoothing method is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. Finally, we conduct various simulations to verify {{the validity of the}} proposed scheme and demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared with conventional schemes.

40|$|A single-chip 94 GHz {{frequency}} modulated {{continuous wave}} (FMCW) radar module {{has been developed}} for high resolution sensoring under adverse conditions and environments. The {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (MMIC) includes a varactor tuned VCO with injection port, very compact transmit and receive amplifiers and a single-ended resistive mixer. To enable bidirectional operation of a single <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antenna</b> a combination of a Wilkinson divider and a Lange coupler was integrated. The circuit features coplanar technology and cascode HEMTs for compact size and low cost. These techniques result in a particularly small over-all chip-size of only 2 x 3 mm 2. The packaged 94 GHz FMCW radar sensor achieved a tuning range of 6 GHz, an output power of 1 mW and a conversion loss of 5 dB. The RF performance of the radar module was successfully verified by real-time monitoring the time flow of a gas-assisted injection molding process...|$|E
40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} interest in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) systems, reducing {{the costs associated}} with RF-chains at the radio front end becomes a very important factor. In this paper, we propose two solutions to the problem of joint <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antenna</b> selection with the objective of maximizing data rates and satisfying interference constraints at the primary user (PU) receiver. In the first method we approximate the original non-convex optimization problem with an iterative way of solving a series of smaller convex problems. Then we present a novel, norm-based transmit receive antenna selection technique that simultaneously improves throughput while maintaining the PU interference constraints. We show that this simple approach yields near optimal results with massive complexity reductions. In addition to making a performance comparison between the proposed approaches and the optimal exhaustive search approach, we establish that antenna selection is a promising option for future MIMO CR devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of two approaches to short-range radar imaging at microwaves {{by means of}} ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. The first approach represents a classical synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that employs a <b>transmit–receive</b> <b>antenna</b> pair on mechanical scanner. The second one makes use of a {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) antenna array that scans electronically in the horizontal plane and mechanically, installed on the scanner, in the vertical plane. The mechanical scanning in only one direction reduces significantly the measurement time. Two respective prototypes have been built and compared. Both systems comprise the same 10 – 18 GHz antennas and multi-channel video impulse electronics while the same data processing and imaging method based on Kirchhoff migration is applied to acquired data for digital beamforming. The study has been done for an application of concealed weapon detection. TelecommunicationsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} {{is one of}} the prime concerns that leads the researcher to investigate collaborative wireless sensor networks with some application specific challenges. Such challenges include combining distributed data synchronously, performing power aware signal processing, defining communication methods that can provide progressive accuracy and, optimising processing and communication for signal transmission. A cooperative resource selection and transmission scheme is proposed to improve the performance of collaborative wireless sensor networks in terms of maintaining link reliability. A measure of Channel Quality Index (CQI) is also proposed to obtain dynamic adaptivity and to optimise resource usage within wireless sensor networks according to environment conditions. As part of the proposed cooperative nature of transmission, the recently proposed <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antenna</b> selection scheme and lattice reduction algorithm have also been considered. It is assumed that channel state information (CSI) is estimated at receiver and also there is a feedback link between the wireless sensing nodes and the fusion centre receiver. From the simulation results it is observed that for 99. 99...|$|E
40|$|This letter {{proposes a}} {{parametric}} sparse {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) -OFDM channel estimation {{scheme based on}} the finite rate of innovation (FRI) theory, whereby super-resolution estimates of path delays with arbitrary values can be achieved. Meanwhile, both the spatial and temporal correlations of wireless MIMO channels are exploited to improve the accuracy of the channel estimation. For outdoor communication scenarios, where wireless channels are sparse in nature, path delays of different <b>transmit-receive</b> <b>antenna</b> pairs share a common sparse pattern due to the spatial correlation of MIMO channels. Meanwhile, the channel sparse pattern is nearly unchanged during several adjacent OFDM symbols due to the temporal correlation of MIMO channels. By simultaneously exploiting those MIMO channel characteristics, the proposed scheme performs better than existing state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, by joint processing of signals associated with different antennas, the pilot overhead can be reduced under the framework of the FRI theory.
