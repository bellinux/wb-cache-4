Duke Power Co., which ruled <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> {{did not have}} to willfully discriminate against employees to violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even if that was not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{attaining}} the premiership, Chamberlain obtained {{passage of}} the Factories Act 1937. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. In 1938, Parliament enacted the Coal Act 1938, which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the Holidays with Pay Act. Though the Act only recommended <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> give workers a week off with pay, it led to a great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for the working classes. The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance and maintained rent control. Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect. In the event, it wasn't until 1 September 1972 when the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began 1964.|$|E
5|$|The late 17th {{century in}} England {{was a time}} of great {{progress}} in design. Following the austere years of Commonwealth rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the Grand Tour, returned home with new ideas—often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the Baroque era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, John Webb, and Sir Christopher Wren were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is Coleshill House in Berkshire, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase. Great Halls were considered redundant now <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. While Belton is not in the Baroque style, it displays all the traits typical of the new tendencies.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{international}} {{studies have shown}} <b>that</b> <b>Employer</b> Branding is becoming an important element when companies are trying to differentiate themselves {{in the eyes of}} potential employees. In Finland research data about the state of Employer Branding is not available. Thus, the primary contribution of this thesis to the current knowledge of the topic is to find out the position of Employer Branding in Finnish companies today. The empirical part of the study is based on data collected in a web survey conducted in November 2008 - February 2009. The survey was created based on existing Employer Branding literature and total sampling frame consisted of 190 Finnish companies that had a turnover of over 250 M€ and more than 250 employees in 2008. In total 45 applicable responses were received representing a response rate of 24 % of the sample. The results show <b>that</b> <b>Employer</b> Branding does not have a particularly distinct position in large Finnish companies and, thus, respondents felt <b>that</b> <b>Employer</b> Branding should have a more important role than it currently possesses in their companies. In fact, many companies are developing and researching Employer Branding but resources allocated to the processes were not felt to reach an adequate level. Companies headquartered outside of Finland differentiated from these results as in those companies Employer Branding had more importance and adequate resources than in companies headquartered in Finland. Finally, it was found <b>that</b> <b>Employer</b> Branding is still the responsibility of companies’ human resource departments while marketing and PR departments’ role was surprisingly low...|$|R

25|$|WorkChoices {{required}} <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> provide {{employees with}} five minimum entitlements, which covered maximum ordinary working hours, annual leave, parental leave, personal/carer's leave and minimum pay scales.

25|$|The {{emphasis}} was for war supplies {{as soon as}} possible, regardless of cost and inefficiencies. Industry quickly absorbed the slack in the labor force, and the tables turned such <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> needed to actively and aggressively recruit workers. As the military grew, new labor sources were needed to replace the 12million men serving in the military. Propaganda campaigns started pleading for people {{to work in the}} war factories. The barriers for married women, the old, the unskilled—and (in the North and West) the barriers for racial minorities—were lowered.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} {{collective}} bargaining, Farmer {{and the conservative}} majority on the NLRB were more mixed. In Whitin Machine Works, Farmer joined a majority in holding that unions {{had the right to}} see employer payroll data prior to contract negotiations. And in Richfield Oil Corp., the Farmer board held <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> must bargain over employee stock plans they establish. But the Farmer board also limited bargaining rights in Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., holding that if a union invests its surplus dues in a business venture, and that venture competes with the employer, the employer does not have to bargain with the union.|$|E

25|$|The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is a US {{labor law}} {{governing}} {{the federal law}} of {{occupational health and safety}} in the private sector and federal government in the United States. It was enacted by Congress in 1970 and was signed by President Richard Nixon on December 29, 1970. Its main goal is to ensure <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> provide employees with an environment free from recognized hazards, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise levels, mechanical dangers, heat or cold stress, or unsanitary conditions. The Act created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).|$|E
25|$|The Act {{revised the}} Wagner Act's {{requirement}} of employer neutrality, to allow employers to deliver anti-union messages in the workplace. These changes confirmed an earlier Supreme Court ruling <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> {{have a constitutional}} right to express their opposition to unions, so long as they did not threaten employees with reprisals for their union activities nor offer any incentives to employees as an alternative to unionizing. The amendments also gave employers the right to file a petition asking the Board to determine if a union represents a majority of its employees, and allow employees to petition either to decertify their union, or to invalidate the union security provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
25|$|Lilly Ledbetter sued Goodyear {{claiming}} she {{was paid}} less than men {{doing the same}} work.

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. ___ (2007), Justice Alito held for the five-justice majority <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more.

25|$|Employers {{can also}} be bullies. Bad {{employers}} use bullying strategically to rid the workplace of good employees to avoid a legal obligation, such as paying unemployment compensation or a worker’s compensation claim. Employers also use bullying tactics to drive out employees who demand legal pay or overtime or assert a legal right to organize collectively. The {{most common type of}} complaint filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission involves retaliation, where an employer harasses or bullies an employee for objecting to illegal discrimination. Patricia Barnes, author of Surviving Bullies, Queen Bees & Psychopaths in the Workplace, argues <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> that bully are a critical but often overlooked aspect of the problem in the United States.|$|E
25|$|A {{minimum wage}} {{is the lowest}} {{remuneration}} <b>that</b> <b>employers</b> can legally pay their workers. Equivalently, it is the price floor below which workers may not sell their labor. Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases {{the standard of living}} of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers) and is damaging to businesses, because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a higher wage.|$|E
