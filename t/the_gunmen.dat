5|$|At {{least four}} of <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> were {{soldiers}} from the UDR, the locally recruited infantry regiment of the British Army in Northern Ireland. Martin Dillon suggested in The Dirty War, that at least five serving UDR soldiers were present at the checkpoint. All <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> {{were members of the}} UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade, and had been lying in wait to ambush the band, having set up the checkpoint just minutes before.|$|E

5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gunman</b> {{immediately}} left <b>the</b> car and ran {{towards the}} nearby industrial area, entering a Volkswagen car showroom {{through the main}} entrance. He threatened a salesperson and demanded a key {{for one of the}} vehicles. The salesperson escaped while <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> was distracted. <b>The</b> <b>gunman</b> shot and killed another salesperson and a customer, firing 13 bullets into both people. As he reloaded, another salesperson and visitor fled through the rear exit. <b>The</b> <b>gunman</b> emerged at about 12:30 pm and shot at a passing car. The driver escaped without injury. The police started to arrive and a shootout began. An officer fired eight shots at <b>the</b> <b>gunman,</b> hitting him once in each leg.|$|R
50|$|After {{fleeing from}} the site of the Société Générale shooting, <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> {{acquired}} a vehicle by taking a man hostage in the town of Pluteaux, near La Défense. <b>The</b> <b>gunman</b> forced <b>the</b> man to drive three and a half miles towards central Paris before letting him go at <b>the</b> Champs-Élysées. <b>The</b> <b>gunman</b> continued to flee but was later arrested in an underground parking complex 6 miles north of Paris, in Bois-Colombes. Officials reported that <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> was extremely incoherent due to multiple prescription medications that he had consumed within a short period of time.

5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from <b>the</b> <b>gunmen.</b> During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated <b>the</b> <b>gunmen,</b> and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E
5|$|At 16:30, <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> {{released}} {{their first}} hostage, Frieda Mozaffarian. She had been unwell since the siege began, and Oan {{had asked for}} a doctor to be sent into the embassy to treat her, but the police refused. The other hostages deceived Oan into believing that Mozaffarian was pregnant, and Oan eventually released Mozaffarian after her condition deteriorated.|$|E
5000|$|He {{ordered them}} to drive to Rainworth, six miles away and {{told them not to}} look at him. This {{presented}} PC Mackenzie with a problem. Gently he explained to <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> that they were going the wrong way and he would have to turn the car round. <b>The</b> <b>gunman</b> agreed but warned both officers if there were any tricks they would both be dead. As they were driving along Southwell Road <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> asked if they had any rope.|$|R

50|$|By 1:30 am, a SWAT {{team had}} responded in a raid {{of the mall}} and casino premises. Following a {{confrontation}} {{with one of the}} SWAT units at a stairwell, shots were fired, <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> was suspected to be wounded, and <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> fled upwards to Maxims Tower, one of the complex's hotels. At 1:46 am, <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> shot open <b>the</b> door of Room 510 of the hotel, lit a fire at the corridor, and committed suicide by setting himself on fire in Room 510 and shooting himself in the head.|$|R
5|$|Stephen Travers heard <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> rummaging in {{the back}} of the minibus, where he kept his guitar.

5|$|The {{band was}} {{travelling}} home to Dublin {{late at night}} after a performance in Banbridge. Halfway to Newry, their minibus was stopped at {{what appeared to be}} a military checkpoint, where gunmen in British Army uniforms ordered them to line up by the roadside. At least four of <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> were serving soldiers from the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) but, unbeknownst to the band, all were members of the UVF. While two of <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> (both soldiers) were hiding a time bomb on the minibus, it exploded prematurely and killed them. The other gunmen then opened fire on the dazed band members, killing three and wounding two. It is believed the bomb was meant to explode en route, killing the band and framing them as IRA bomb-smugglers, and possibly leading to stricter security measures at the border.|$|E

Trip also shot off the guard's private parts while robbing the bank, which is the reason why he has been stalking Daryl in order to kill him for revenge. Daryl tries to tell <b>the</b> <b>gunman</b> that it wasn't his fault and soon realizes that the gunman's actions resulted in Trish being killed.

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May, <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> ordered one of the hostages to {{telephone}} the BBC's news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which <b>the</b> <b>gunmen</b> belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, became seriously ill and his colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.|$|E
5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver.

In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill.|$|E
