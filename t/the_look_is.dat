25|$|The Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid uses a {{parallel}} hybrid system HDU {{made by the}} American company Eaton. It comprises inter alia with a 6-speed Eaton automatic gearbox and one electric motor with maximum power of 44kW (60hp). In normal traffic movement the power is on about 28kW (38hp). It operates with a Cummins ISB6.7EV 225B diesel engine, meeting {{the requirements of the}} EEV standard, with a maximum power of 165kW (225hp) and the volume of 6.7 dm. The Eaton gearbox transmits power to the rear axle. All batteries are lithium-ion (Li-Ion) made by the Japanese company Hitachi which have been placed under the platforms inside the vehicle. By this the appearance of the bus has changed and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> different when compared with the traditional diesel engine powered buses. The cost of this system is about 70 thousand Euros.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said that}} the most common {{complaint}} that he received about JC's Girls was [...] "the way Heather Veitch looks... her breasts are too big and she looks too much like a stripper", a complaint to which he responded that [...] "God can use any individual to change the world". Veitch said in 2008 that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls dress like sex workers, but she said that <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. Annie Lobert of Hookers for Jesus, a similar group that collaborates with JC's Girls, said {{around the same time}} that Christians make the same kind of comments about her and her ministry—"They say my T-shirt is too tight", said Lobert, [...] "but, hey, when in Vegas, do as Vegas does".|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Gabriel Beristain, {{returning}} from the One-Shot, used a combination of modern digital technology and traditional analog techniques to replicate the feel of classic films that are set in the 1940s, but to also have the convenience and consistency of modern technology. Beristain uses the Arri Alexa digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets, the latter on which he recalled [...] "I had last used in the 1980s in England on videos and commercials. I remembered that they were fantastic. In combination with the Leica lenses, <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> very classic, {{very much like a}} 1940s film. When I saw it, I said, 'This is absolutely Marvel,' and [...] agreed." [...] For the series' lighting, Beristain again mixed modern and traditional, using LED fixtures to recreate classic Hollywood lighting. He called his lighting of Atwell [...] "an homage to the great cinematographers who lit Lauren Bacall and Grace Kelly." ...|$|E

50|$|On 8 November 1999, <b>the</b> next generic <b>look</b> <b>was</b> born, {{designed}} by English and Pockett with music by Lord David Dundas, {{both of whom}} were involved with <b>the</b> last <b>look.</b> <b>The</b> main theme of <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> ITV slogan of 'TV from the heart'.

500|$|The Netherlandish artists {{moved away}} from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more {{engaging}} three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. [...] Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits {{or in the case of}} potential betrothals, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.|$|E

60|$|Nancy {{you would}} call a shop-girl--because you have the habit. There is no type; but a perverse {{generation}} is always seeking a type; {{so this is what}} the type should be. She has the high-ratted pompadour, and the exaggerated straight-front. Her skirt is shoddy, but has the correct flare. No furs protect her against the bitter spring air, but she wears her short broadcloth jacket as jauntily as though it were Persian lamb! On her face and in her eyes, remorseless type-seeker, is the typical shop-girl expression. It is a look of silent but contemptuous revolt against cheated womanhood; of sad prophecy of the vengeance to come. When she laughs her loudest <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> still there. The same look {{can be seen in the}} eyes of Russian peasants; and those of us left will see it some day on Gabriel's face when he comes to blow us up. It is a look that should wither and abash man; but he has been known to smirk at it and offer flowers--with a string tied to them.|$|E

50|$|Flat panel {{curtains}} {{are simple}} and versatile: to make them, pieces of fabric are hemmed {{on all four}} edges and the final rectangular or square piece is hung from curtains poles with clip-on rings or something similar.

5000|$|Alex Mastas of Lights Out Films {{reviewed}} the show {{gave it a}} grade [...] "A-" [...] and described it, [...] "The backgrounds are rich and imaginative—they composite lot of the show over real photos and occasionally integrate CGI into cartoon. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> weird and ethereal, just like the show itself." ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1975, a {{journalist}} described Trekkies as [...] "smelling of assembly-line junk food, hugely consumed; <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> {{of people who}} consume it, habitually and at length; overfed and undernourished, eruptive of skin and flaccid of form, from the merely soft to the grotesquely obese".

50|$|Crimping irons or {{crimpers}} work by crimping hair in sawtooth style. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} the crimps left after taking out small braids. Crimping irons come in different sizes with different sized ridges on the paddles. Larger ridges produce larger crimps in the hair and smaller ridges produce smaller crimps. Crimped hair was very popular in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The Castro-clone {{appearance}} typically {{consisted of}} masculine attire such as uniforms, leather or Levi jeans, and checked (or plaid) shirts. Typical of <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>was</b> a form-fitting T-shirt, shrink-to-fit denim trousers worn snugly (bell bottoms and low-rise jeans {{in the early}} 1970s, later more traditionally working-class 501s), sneakers or boots, and often a full moustache and sideburns. Hair styles were relatively short, not a crew cut, but definitely something that would not blow in the wind or require much hair spray {{to hold it in}} place. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>was</b> modelled heavily on the greasers of the 1950s and 1960s, which was also an influence on punk, heavy metal and fetish subcultures.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>was</b> {{refreshed}} in July 2009, {{making the}} logo notably larger. As {{part of the}} refresh, special idents were made for popular shows such as The Mentalist, Paul Merton in Europe, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, The Gadget Show and FlashForward.|$|R
