5|$|Scotland {{fans are}} collectively {{known as the}} <b>Tartan</b> Army. During the 1970s, Scotland fans became known for their hooliganism in England, {{particularly}} after they invaded the Wembley pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the England v Scotland match in 1977. Since then, the <b>Tartan</b> Army have won awards from UEFA for their combination of vocal support, friendly nature and charity work. The <b>Tartan</b> Army have been awarded a Fair Play prize by the Belgian Olympic Committee and were named as the best supporters during the 1992 European Championship. The fans were also presented with a trophy for non-violence in sport and were voted by journalists {{to be the best}} supporters for their sense of fair play and sporting spirit at the 1998 World Cup in France.|$|E
5|$|The current junior (R10) uniform was {{introduced}} in 1997. In summer, girls are required to wear a Black Watch tunic, short-sleeve white blouse, green blazer with <b>tartan</b> piping, short green socks and black leather shoes. The winter uniform consists of the tunic, long-sleeve white blouse, the blazer, green jumper or vest, Black Watch <b>Tartan</b> tie, Black Watch <b>Tartan</b> scarf and either green knee-high socks or black stockings. School pockets are awarded for student achievements, and are embroidered in red on the pockets of junior blazers (R10 girls), and white on the left-breast of senior blazers (1112 girls).|$|E
5|$|Ferguson was a Jacobite. The {{records of}} the Spalding Club include a soldier's letter which {{indicates}} it is likely Ferguson was willing to offer refuge to Jacobites {{who participated in the}} Battle of Culloden. Jacobite rebels captured from throughout Scotland were taken to stand trial at Carlisle Castle in 1746. Ferguson and fellow advocate Alexander Lockhart argued in their defence. Prosecutors showed little mercy, calling for the rebels to be executed by hanging. Since the prosecution assumed anyone dressed in <b>tartan</b> was guilty, Ferguson and Lockhart had their servants dress in <b>tartan</b> and appear along with the other defendants. They called each other to the stand to testify as to the whereabouts of the servants and proved that, despite their <b>tartan</b> dress, the defendants could not have taken part in the rebellion. Many were found guilty, but the tactic succeeded, as some of the accused were acquitted, including the Laird of Dunfallandy, a kinsman of Ferguson.|$|E

2500|$|In a final {{letter in}} this {{exchange}} from Scott to Lauder, dated 19 November 1829, Scott rejected again {{the authenticity of}} the Vestiarium Scoticum and further rejected the notion that Lowlanders ever wore clan <b>tartans.</b> He went further and rejected the entire notion of clan <b>tartans,</b> stating that the [...] "idea of distinguishing the clans by their <b>tartans</b> is but a fashion of modern date…".|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1947, a pageant {{commemorating the}} signing of the Declaration has been held within the roofless remains of the abbey (last {{full-scale}} event 2005). This was run by the local Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society, now Arbroath Abbey Timethemes, a registered charity, and re-enacts the story and history of the signing. The group also spearhead Scotland's <b>Tartan</b> Day celebrations on 6 April in association with Angus Council as well as educational visits to local schools.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite risings, a movement to restore Stuart King James II of England to the throne, the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process of the destruction of the clan system. Measures included a ban on the bearing of arms, the wearing of <b>tartan</b> and limitations on the activities of the Episcopalian Church. Most of the legislation was repealed {{by the end of the}} eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{supporters}} are collectively {{known as the}} <b>Tartan</b> Army. The Scottish Football Association operates a roll of honour for every player who has made more than 50 appearances for Scotland. Kenny Dalglish holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986. Dalglish scored 30 goals for Scotland and shares the record for most goals scored with Denis Law.|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that a conventionally woven textile consists of two assemblies of parallel threads (warp and weft), one interlaced with the other at ninety degrees. Where {{each of the two}} assemblies is arranged in a particular colour sequence, a check design, known as a ‘tartan’, may be created. Although similar check-type cloths have been produced worldwide, it is the <b>tartans</b> of Scotland which have received most attention and it is here that a complex set of rules evolved and <b>tartans</b> of different types became associated traditionally with different regions, family groups or 'clans'. There is an impressive array of publications focused on the identification of <b>tartans</b> and their clan associations. This paper explains the nature of <b>tartans,</b> analyses typical surface structures, ratios and proportions, and suggests possible avenues of use for modern designers. The principal sources of data were a collection of <b>tartans</b> held at ULITA - An Archive of International Textiles (University of Leeds, UK) and Stewart's 1974 publication The Setts of Scottish <b>Tartans.</b> Based on the observation that divisions into halfs and thirds were dominant, a series of templates is presented with the intention of developing an awareness among designers that ratios and proportions used in familiar or traditional frameworks can be employed in a modern context...|$|R
50|$|Membership of the Scottish <b>Tartans</b> Authority {{is open to}} anyone, with fees {{ranging from}} £20 yearly for private membership, from £50 for {{business}} membership and £500 for lifetime membership, as of 2016. The Scottish <b>Tartans</b> Authority maintains a website which lists about 3,500 different <b>tartans,</b> though detailed information of each design is only available to members. There are a range of membership benefits, according to the website but perhaps most importantly membership directly contributes to ensuring that one of Scotland's most treasured icons is maintained for future generations of Scots, both home and abroad.|$|R

5|$|The {{distinctive}} Black Watch <b>Tartan</b> of {{the college}} was introduced in 1918. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated skirts and white blouses; junior girls wore pinafore dresses. All girls wore a navy blazer and heavy woollen stockings. Prefects also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt Breton was introduced for winter use, and no change was made until {{the introduction of the}} green beret in 1952.|$|E
5|$|A {{statue of}} Mercury stood over the {{entrance}} to the Dominion Theatre in London's West End from May 2002 to May 2014 for Queen and Ben Elton's musical We Will Rock You.

In December 2009 a large model of Mercury wearing <b>tartan</b> was put on display in Edinburgh as publicity for the run of We Will Rock You at the Playhouse Theatre.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, the RhAR was {{withdrawn}} {{for a period}} of rest and recuperation (R). The battalion's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base: a shot through the windscreen of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver, but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured. On 26 November, the RhAR and the King's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at Kelapa Sawit in an action called <b>Tartan</b> Rock: the security forces moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers, most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore. Two days later, the RhAR were back on regular duty.|$|E

5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish <b>tartan</b> dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered or rubble walls, unpainted stone fireplaces and pitch pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of <b>tartan,</b> weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, gaslighting and water-closets.|$|E
5|$|On {{completion}} of the course, participants are awarded the Wood Badge beads to recognize significant achievement in leadership and direct service to young people. The pair of small wooden beads, one on each end of a leather thong (string), is worn around the neck {{as part of the}} Scout uniform. The beads are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a <b>tartan</b> patch of the Maclaren clan, honoring William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the £7000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional £3000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate. The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle (neckerchief slide) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians.|$|E
