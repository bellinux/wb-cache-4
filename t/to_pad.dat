5|$|Dewes and Len Hutton {{opened for}} England, {{a move that}} {{attracted}} criticism of Yardley for exposing the debutant Dewes to the new ball bowling of Lindwall and Keith Miller. After Hutton opened the scoring with a single from the second ball of the day, Dewes was on strike. The single had almost turned into a five when Sam Loxton fired in a wide return, but Sid Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows. Dewes took a single from the opening over—bowled by Lindwall—and thus faced {{the start of the}} second over, which was delivered by Miller. Dewes had been troubled by Miller in the past. During the Victory Tests in 1945, Miller had repeatedly dismissed the batsman, and during a match for Cambridge University against the Australians earlier in the tour, Dewes had used towels <b>to</b> <b>pad</b> his torso against Miller's short balls. During his short innings, Dewes was also visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still.|$|E
5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises <b>to</b> <b>pad</b> their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned <b>to</b> <b>pad</b> their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E

25|$|McGovern ran on a {{platform}} of immediately ending the Vietnam War and instituting guaranteed minimum incomes for the nation’s poor. His campaign was harmed by his views during the primaries (which alienated many powerful Democrats), the perception that his foreign policy was too extreme, and the Eagleton debacle. With McGovern’s campaign weakened by these factors, the Republicans successfully portrayed him as a radical left-wing extremist incompetent to serve as president. Nixon led in the polls by large margins throughout the entire campaign. With an enormous fundraising advantage and a comfortable lead in the polls, Nixon concentrated on large rallies and focused speeches to closed, select audiences, leaving much of the retail campaigning to surrogates like Vice President Agnew. Nixon did not, by design, try to extend his coattails to Republican congressional or gubernatorial candidates, preferring <b>to</b> <b>pad</b> his own margin of victory.|$|E

It was broadcast on July17,2011, and was the first original Breaking Bad episode in 13months, since the third season finale episode [...] "Full Measure" [...] aired in June 2010. AMC officials delayed the fourth-season premiere until July because they felt the Nielsen ratings would be better during the summer. While Breaking Bad scripts are generally 50pages long, the screenplay to [...] "Box Cutter" [...] was 43pages long, and Gilligan was originally concerned because he did not want to stretch out the episode simply <b>to</b> <b>pad</b> the running time. [...] "Full Measure" [...] ended with Jesse's pulling a gun on Gale and firing directly into the screen, with Gale's death not visibly revealed on-screen. This led to wide speculation among fans and reviewers that Jesse did not actually kill Gale, but rather aimed away from him and fired the gun. This speculation continued up until the original broadcast of [...] "Box Cutter", which confirmed Jesse indeed killed Gale.
