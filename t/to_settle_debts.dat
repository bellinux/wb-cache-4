500|$|When Du Bois {{was five}} years old, his {{grandfather}} died, and his grandmother was forced to sell her house <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>debts.</b> Du Bois' mother moved the family into Great Barrington, where she struggled to support her son. A gifted student, Du Bois attended Fisk University on scholarship and with funds raised by members of his First Congregational Church in town. He completed a second bachelor's degree at Harvard, as well as graduate work there and in Berlin, becoming the first African American to earn a doctorate at Harvard. He embarked on a distinguished career. [...] Over the next decades, Du Bois periodically returned to Great Barrington. His children were born there (in the homes of maternal relatives). He buried his son Burghardt (1887–89) and wife Nina (d. 1950) there. In 1906, he sent his young family to Great Barrington {{from where he was}} working in Atlanta, Georgia, after that year's race riots.|$|E
2500|$|The Mafia {{began in}} the 19th century. [...] Modern {{scholars}} believe that the seeds were planted in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of feudalism beginning in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned {{most of the land}} and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. Primogeniture was abolished, land could no longer be seized <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>debts,</b> and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants. After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge boom in landowners — from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861. With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism. Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim. Compounding these problems was banditry; rising food prices, the loss of public and church lands, and the loss of feudal commons pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors. [...] These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.|$|E
