6000|$|He {{broke off}} for a moment. [...] "After all, this is the single man's country, and--we--know that it demands from him the best that he was given, from the grimmest toil of his body to the keenest effort of his brain. Marriage is a detail--an incident; we're here to fight, {{to grapple with the}} wilderness, and to break it in, and that burden wasn't laid upon us only for the good of ourselves. When we've flung our {{trestles}} over the rivers, and blown room for the steel track out of the cañon's side, the oat-fields and the orchards creep up the valleys, and the men from the cities set up their mills. Prospector, <b>track-layer,</b> chopper, follow in sequence here, and then we're ready to hold out our hands to the thousands you've no use or food for back yonder. I'm not sure it matters that the men who do the work don't often share the results of it. We bury them beside our bridge trestles and under tons of shattered rock, and, perhaps, when their time comes, some of them aren't sorry to have done with it. Anyway, they've stood up to man's primeval task." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is to design a two-generation family house, where {{one part of the}} house will be two-storey and the second {{single-storey}} and barrier-free. Each of these flats will have a separate entrance for reason of privacy. This house is designed by system of frame structure, where is developed the structures for the implementation of wooden house. The architectural design drawings are supplemented by the necessary detail drawings and manufacturing drawings with technical descriptions. The roofing is made in two variants, a gabled and rack roof. One part of the thesis deals with draft pieces of particular designs that meet the requirements for low energy buildings. For the <b>track-layer</b> construction is done thermally technical assessment. The thesis also includes the comparison of therm insulation materials, that are used in the individual constructions. There is prepared an inventory of construction works and supplies with statement of measurements...|$|E
60|$|Thirlwell agreed. A {{half-breed}} voyageur {{does not}} waste food, and with inherited caution seldom disturbs the bush. It {{looked as if}} the city man had engaged a gang of <b>track-layers,</b> who are used to pioneering and sometimes carry surveyors' stores through the wilds.|$|R
25|$|The {{ceremony}} {{began with}} a race between the <b>track-layers</b> and crews from the eastern and western ends of construction. The last mile had been left unfinished and each crew was timed to see who could complete their last half mile the fastest. The eastern crew won {{by a margin of}} only a few minutes and then the western crew placed the last rail.|$|R
60|$|Speaking generally, {{winter is}} much less severe in British Columbia, {{especially}} near the coast, than {{it is on the}} prairie, though it is sufficiently trying high up among the mountains, where as a rule little work is done at that season. Still, though the number of the <b>track-layers</b> was largely reduced, the inhabitants of the mining region had waited long enough, and so, in spite of many hardships, slowly, fathom by fathom, we carried the rail-head on.|$|R
5000|$|Aroya is a small, rural, unincorporated {{community}} in Cheyenne County, Colorado, United States {{at the eastern}} end of State Highway 94 near its junction with U.S. Highway 40/U.S. Highway 287. The name Arroyo appears on some older maps. The town was named [...] "Aroya" [...] because of a gulch nearby (arroyo is a Spanish word for [...] "gulch"). The gulch is now named the Aroya Gulch. Aroya originated in 1870 three miles west of the present site as a camp for Kansas-Pacific Railroad <b>track-layers,</b> but was moved to the present site because there was a better supply of water.|$|R
