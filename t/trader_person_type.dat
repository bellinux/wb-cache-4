40|$|The associationistic view {{of person}} {{perception}} states {{that people are}} perceived in terms of trait covariations.

In contrast, he typological view is that others are perceived in terms of <b>person</b> <b>types,</b> and traits within a given <b>person</b> <b>type</b> have a unique interactive r lation. In Experi-ment l, associationistic, dimensional, nd typological representations f implicit personality he-ories were empirically derived. The derived stimuli were used in Experiment 2, which examined the effects of <b>person</b> <b>type</b> membership on impression priming and perceived trait belongingness, controlling for associationistic and dimensional f ctors.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} to represent {{individual differences in}} situation-behavior profiles. The model consists of 3 components: (a) Typologies of person, situation, and behavior classes; (b) hierarchical relations between the classes of each typology; and (c) a characterization of the <b>person</b> <b>types</b> in terms of different sets of if(situation class) then (behavior class) rules by which the 3 typologies are linked to one another. A data analysis technique (INDCLAS) is available to induce a triple typology model from empirical data. To reveal the psychological mechanisms behind such a model, the classes of the model {{can be related to}} situation, behavior, and person features. As a result, <b>person</b> <b>types</b> can be interpreted in terms of systems of cognitive-affective variables that mediate between active situation features and behavioral manifestations. This is illustrated with a study on self-reported hostile behavior in frustrating situations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Theories {{of social}} {{cognition}} state that person attributes are cognitively organized either {{by means of}} a limited number of dimensions or in terms of discrete <b>person</b> <b>types,</b> where traits within a given <b>person</b> <b>type</b> have a unique internal structure. Associated with these two theoretical views are dierent measurement techniques and statistical models. A methodological study compared trait ratings, trait sortings and subset assignments as typical measurement procedures within the theoretical approaches according to the appropriateness of a dimensional or a categorical statistical model. As expected, the results indicate a dimensional model for rating data and a categorical model for sorting data. In contrast, both statistical models failed to explain the structure of subset assignments. It is shown that trait ratings and sortings dier from subset assignments in that only the rst allow for data aggregation and dimension reduction, whereas subset assignments induce a much more complex structure and require a more nely grained data analysis methodology which is provided by Formal Concept Analysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{psychological}} research, one often aims at explaining {{individual differences}} in S-R profiles, that is, {{individual differences in}} the responses (R) with which people react to specific stimuli (S). To this end, researchers often postulate an underlying sequential process, which boils down to the specification {{of a set of}} mediating variables (M) and the processes that link these mediating variables to the stimuli and responses under study. Obviously, a crucial task is to chart how the individual differences in the S-R profiles are caused by individual differences in the S-M link and/or by individual differences in the M-R link. In this paper we propose a new model, called CLASSI, which was explicitly designed for this task. In particular, the key principle of CLASSI consists of reducing the S, M, and R nodes of a sequential process to a few mutually exclusive types and inducing an S-M and an M-R person typology from the data, with the S-M <b>person</b> <b>types</b> being characterized in terms of if S type then M type rules and the M-R <b>person</b> <b>types</b> in terms of if M type then R type rules. As such, the S-M and M-R <b>person</b> <b>types</b> and their associated if–then rules represent the important individual differences in the S-M and M-R links of the sequential process under study. An algorithm to fit the CLASSI model is described and evaluated in a simulation study. An application of CLASSI to data from the behavioral domain of anger and sadness is discussed. Finally, we relate CLASSI to other methods and discuss possible extensions. status: publishe...|$|R
