5|$|In February 2016, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of the Zika virus, the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9billion to fight <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589million in funds previously designated {{as part of the}} response to Ebola, to fight <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of the Zika virus. Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152million for the domestic effort. In response to Congressional complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding the CDC's funding to fight Zika would be depleted by September30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1billion to fight <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21babies born in the United States with microcephaly testing positive for Zika.|$|E

5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees {{to show signs of}} disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina is closely related to A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E

Thermal buoyancy drives upwelling beneath the axis and convective overturn, which forms rolls aligned perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> axis. <b>The</b> distance from the axis at which these rolls form is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> rate, mantle viscosity, and relative strength of compositional buoyancy.

40|$|Comparing {{with single}} networks, the {{multiplex}} networks bring two main effects on <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> process among individuals. First, the pathogen or {{information can be}} transmitted to more individuals through different layers at one time, which enlarges <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> scope. Second, through different layers, an individual can also transmit the pathogen or information to the same individuals more than once at one time, which makes <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> more effective. To understand the different roles of <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> scope and effectiveness, we propose an epidemic model on multiplex networks with link overlapping, where <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> effectiveness of each interaction {{as well as the}} variety of channels (spreading scope) can be controlled by the number of overlapping links. We find that for Poisson degree distribution, increasing the epidemic scope (the first effect) is more efficient than enhancing epidemic probability (the second effect) to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> process. However, for power-law degree distribution, the effects of the two factors on <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> dynamics become complicated. Enhancing epidemic probability makes pathogen or rumor easier to outbreak in a finite system. But after that increasing epidemic scopes is still more effective for a wide spreading. Theoretical results along with reasonable explanation for these phenomena are all given in this paper, which indicates that the epidemic scope could {{play an important role in}} <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> dynamics.
