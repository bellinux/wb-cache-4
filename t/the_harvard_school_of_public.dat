5|$|By {{the age of}} eight, Alex {{had begun}} playing both {{basketball}} and football. He would shoot hoops with a soccer ball and a milk crate nailed to a tree. The sport was becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria due {{to the success of}} National Basketball Association (NBA) center Hakeem Olajuwon and Owumi often followed the NBA. When he was 12, his family moved to England, where they lived for three years. They then settled in Boston after his father joined <b>the</b> <b>Harvard</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Health. In sixth grade, he enrolled at the local Tobin K-8 School. He attended Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Boston, where he played basketball and football. Owumi later estimated that he lost, at most, nine high school basketball games. At Burke in 2003, he won The Boston Globe Scholar Athlete Award, given to the top male and female student-athletes in Boston. Owumi was also a part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball team, Boston Amateur Athletic Club.|$|E
5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at <b>the</b> <b>Harvard</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards {{the end of her life}} she received numerous awards and accolades.|$|E
5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at <b>the</b> <b>Harvard</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

500|$|A {{few studies}} have {{suggested}} that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. However, a number of very large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at <b>the</b> <b>Harvard</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> Health, summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat: [...] "Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease." ...|$|E

He ultimately felt that because Duerr had refused to correct his factual mistakes for the English translation, the book had left the realms of scholarship and instead become an [...] "obscure cultural artifact", one which was [...] "represented by the myriad descriptions of cryptic symbols" [...] that are discussed within its pages. Going on to comment on Duerr's main argument regarding the relationship between Wilderness and Civilization, Valadez also expressed his opinion that Duerr had made a [...] "fundamental error" [...] in assuming that Wilderness is not accessible to everyone [...] "by virtue of genetic heritage." ...|$|E
