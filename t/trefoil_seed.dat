(Ø 1. 0 - 1. 6 mm) and 10 {{variants}} of ultrasound treatments with different intensities and exposure times (0. 11 - 2. 72 W/cm 2 and 10 - 160 seconds). After treating the bird’s-foot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seed</b> groups with ultrasounds, the bird’s-foot trefoil seeds were put into Petri vases for germination and the following parameters were measured: germinating energy (after 10 days), germinating faculty (after 21 days) and share of hard bird’s-foot trefoil seeds (after 31 days). Research results show a very significant decrease of the share of hard bird’s-foot trefoil seeds in the groups of medium- and large-size bird’s-foot trefoil seeds treated with ultrasounds, compared to the control variant (no group seeds) or to the small-size bird’s-foot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seed</b> group treated with ultrasounds.

40|$|Insect surveys {{taken during}} 1984 - 1986 in Ashland and Bayfield Counties of {{northern}} Wisconsin revealed that several potential insect pest species were common in birdsfoot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus. Three plant bug species, including: the tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris: alfalfa plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus; and Plagiognathus chrysanthemi were abundant in most sampled fields. P. chrysanthemi {{was the most}} abundant species, was only present in the northern locations, and completed one generation per year. A. lineolatus and L. lineolaris were second and third in abundance, respectively, and completed two generations per year.

40|$|Abstract. Bird’s-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) is a {{perennial}} species with lower seed germination ability {{because of the}} large share of hard seeds. To increase germinating ability, the trial was based on treating bird’s-foot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seeds</b> with ultrasounds (at different intensities and for different periods of time); they were then kept for a few days at- 30 oC. Treatment results show that the control variant (not treated) reached a germination level of 57. 80 %, while the variant treated with ultrasounds and thermally reached a germination level of 94. 53 % (i. e. 63. 5 % more) ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 There is no {{information}} available on water management of birdsfoot trefoil grown for seed. Information is also not available describing how to minimize seed losses due to shattering {{in order to obtain}} consistently high birdsfoot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seed</b> yields. The objectives of this research are to: (i) quantify crop water use, effects of soil-water availability and optimal water management conditions for birdsfoot trefoil grown for seed, (ii) determine the effects of irrigation timing and amount on flower production, seed yield, and yield components, and (iii) quantify the effects of soil-water availability on seed shattering and determine optimal harvest time to reduce seed yield losses due to shattering. Five supplemental irrigations treatments and a non-irrigated control were applied in 1994 and 1995; in 1996, only treatments low stress and non irrigated control were investigated, near Corvallis, OR on a Woodburn silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquultic Argixeroll). Increasing amounts of applied water increased seasonal ET[subscript c] with low stressed plants having the greatest ET[subscript c] and non-irrigated control plants the least. The fraction of available soil-water used was primarily dependent upon the irrigation depletion percentage and secondarily dependent upon irrigation replacement amount. Soil-water conditions favorable for vegetative development and seed yield water use efficiency are opposite. Birdsfoot trefoil grown for seed requires minimal or no supplemental irrigation. For non-irrigated conditions, the crop water requirement ranges from 240 to 255 mm. In the first year of production, plants under low-stress conditions sustained flowering longer than with limited or no irrigation applications. Flowering was not affected by irrigation in subsequent years of production. Total above-ground phytomass production was correlated with the amount of applied irrigation water (r= 0. 92). Umbel density and number of seeds per pod are the primary determinants of total seed yield (r= 0. 77 and 0. 92, respectively). Manipulation of the reproductive development pattern by different water application times and amounts does not affect peak seed shattering events. Crop-water stress status affects the percentage of total shattered seeds shattered at harvest time (r=- 0. 76). Increasing amounts of applied water increase the percentage of potential shatter losses that will shatter by harvest time (r= 0. 65). Seed shatter losses fluctuate during the reproductive development period but are not influenced by the water application treatments. Climatic variables as measured in this experiment cannot be used to predict the time of peak seed shatter events. A total of 109 heat units are needed from the time from initial pod dehiscence until rapid shattering occurs...|$|E
40|$|A {{vascular}} wilt of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) caused by Fusarium oxysporum was first {{reported in the}} 1970 s in <b>trefoil</b> <b>seed</b> production fields in the Champlain Valley of New York and Vermont and in the late 1980 s in trefoil forage production fields in western New York, and the disease {{continues to be a}} problem in both regions. Infected plants display root necrosis and wilt as temperatures increase in the summer, leading to high rates of mortality in the seeding year. However, accurate diagnosis of the disease has always been problematic. The symptoms – wilting, yellowing of the foliage, root necrosis, and plant death – can also be caused by other factors, both biotic and abiotic, and the causal fungus is morphologically indistinguishable from the ubiquitous nonpathogenic F. oxysporum routinely isolated from roots. Accurate diagnosis requires isolating F. oxysporum from the symptomatic plant, inoculating a healthy trefoil plant with the isolated fungus, and waiting to see if wilt symptoms develop, a process that is costly in both time and resources. Management of the pathogen has been further complicated by a lack of understanding of its host range. Most pathogenic strains of F. oxysporum cause symptoms on multiple host plants, and it was unknown whether the trefoil-wilt F. oxysporum caused symptoms, with corresponding yield loss, on other legumes commonly grown by New York growers. Five isolates of F. oxysporum pathogenic to trefoil and three isolates of F. oxysporumpathogenic to other hosts were used to inoculate alfalfa, red clover, trefoil, soybeans, dry beans, and peas in a replicated greenhouse experiment. Cultivars with known F. oxysporum susceptibility were used, and inoculations followed standardized procedures developed by previous researchers. The trefoil-wilt F. oxysporum caused severe wilting and root necrosis of trefoil, moderate wilting and root necrosis of peas, and mild root necrosis of red clover, but it did not cause symptom development on alfalfa, soybeans or dry beans. The results suggest that peas and red clover may suffer light to moderate yield losses when planted in infested fields, but that alfalfa, dry beans and soybeans are likely to be unaffected. To evaluate the feasibility of developing a DNA-based diagnostic procedure, the complete intergenic spacer region and portions of two other genes were sequenced for 28 isolates of the trefoil-wilt F. oxysporum, and the sequences were compared to corresponding sequences from F. oxysporum nonpathogenic to trefoil, including F. oxysporum pathogenic to other hosts. The results indicate that the trefoil-wilt F. oxysporum populations found in New York and Vermont production fields are very closely related to each other but genetically distinct from other F. oxysporum, suggesting that {{it will be possible to}} develop a single DNA-based polymerase chain reaction diagnostic test for the pathogen. Development of the diagnostic test will commence in early 2007, and the test should be completed within a year...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A field {{experiment}} under irrigation {{was conducted at}} the Hyslop Agronomy Farm, near Corvallis, Oregon, during the 1967 growing season to evaluate the effect of barley row spacing, nitrogen rate and placement, and weed competition {{in the year of}} <b>seeding</b> upon birdsfoot <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus corniculatus L.) seedling establishment. The effect of birdsfoot trefoil on barley grain production was also evaluated. Three herbicides were used to measure the effects of weed competition upon birdsfoot trefoil establishment and barley grain production. These are: Avadex BW 1. 25 lb. ai. per acre, 2, 4 -DB amine 1. 50 Ib. ai. per acre and DNBP amine 1. 50 lb. ai. per acre. The effects of nitrogen in birdsfoot trefoil establishment and on barley grain production were studied using two systems of placement: 80 lb. N per acre broadcast and 20 lb. N per acre applied in rows spaced at 7 inches plus 60 lb. N per acre broadcast. The effects of row spacing on birdsfoot trefoil establishment and barley grain production were determined using five systems of seeding: (1) barley seeded alone in rows spaced at 7 inches, (2) barley seeded alone in rows spaced at 14 inches, (3) barley seeded in rows spaced at 7 inches plus birdsfoot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seeded</b> {{at the same time in}} the same row, (4) barley seeded in rows spaced at 14 inches plus birdsfoot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seeded</b> at the same time in the same row and in row between barley, and (5) birdsfoot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seeded</b> in rows spaced at 7 inches. It was concluded that the use of a barley companion crop to establish birdsfoot trefoil decreases the vigor of the trefoil; however, the number of plants per foot of row was similar to the other treatments. At constant seed rate of barley, an increase in row spacing above 7 inches gave a decrease of grain yield and an increase of dry matter yield of birdsfoot <b>trefoil.</b> Birdsfoot <b>trefoil</b> <b>seeded</b> alone gave the highest dry matter yield in the year of establishment. The trefoil did not affect the yield of barley. Application of nitrogen as urea reduced the number of plants of birdsfoot trefoil, when this species was seeded alone or together with barley, but the yield of the forage species was not reduced. Nitrogen application of 80 pounds per acre increased barley grain yield when it was applied broadcast, but not when it was split into 20 pounds nitrogen per acre in rows at seven inches and 60 pounds nitrogen per acre broadcast. An interaction between 2, 4 -DB application and nitrogen placement was found in barley grain production, but not in birdsfoot trefoil establishment. Also, an interaction between 2, 4 -DB application and system of seeding was found to affect yield of dry matter of birdsfoot trefoil. 2, 4 -DB increased birdsfoot trefoil yield and effectively controlled red root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album L.), common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.), and shepherdspurse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medic.), but it did not influence barley grain yield and the number of plants of birdsfoot trefoil per foot of row. DNBP had a detrimental effect on barley yield and was similar to no herbicide on birdsfoot trefoil dry matter yield. It provided good control of common groundsel and shepherdspurse, and gave a poor control of red root pigweed and common lambsquarter. Avadex BW was applied to control wild oat; however, this weed was not present...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Field, greenhouse, {{growth chamber}} and {{laboratory}} experiments evaluated factors affecting establishment, survival {{and production of}} birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) Field studies investigated {{the effects of a}} barley companion crop, seedling year harvest management and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization upon stands, survival and subsequent production of legumes. Seedings were made in each of two years. Stands of legumes were not affected by fertilization or harvest management, but decreased with increasing levels of companion crop competition. Death of seedlings occurred early in the establishment period and the degree of loss was similar for both species. Additional losses of plants did not occur during the establishment year. Losses of birdsfoot trefoil plants established with a companion crop occurred during the first winter following seeding. Stand reduction in the seeding year persisted {{for the duration of the}} experiment. Companion crops inhibited the growth of surviving seedlings. Growth inhibition was less when barley was clipped periodically than when it was matured to grain. In the absence of a companion crop, growth of seedlings was inhibited more by frequent clipping of thin weed stands than by allowing weeds to mature. Yields of weeds were inversely proportional to density of barley plants. Wild oats was more detrimental to seedling growth and was less readily controlled by clipping than redroot pigweed or pigeon grass. The percentage of solar radiation intercepted by barley varied from 89 in early morning or late evening to 22 at noon. Light intensity was reduced more by barley in early season and less by barley in late season than by wild oats. Yields of mixtures in the year after seeding were reduced as a result of establishment with a companion crop and to a greater degree and for a longer period of time when barley had been allowed to mature. Yield reductions of legumes were compensated for by increased grass yields. Grass grown with birdsfoot trefoil yielded significantly more in early season and significantly less in late season than grass grown with alfalfa. Greenhouse studies evaluated the influenee of soil temperature and phosphorus fertilization upon growth and phosphorus uptake of birdsfoot trefoil and alfalfa. Root growth of both species increased with increasing soil temperatures. Weight of alfalfa roots was twice that of birdsfoot trefoil at all temperatures. Top growth of birdsfoot trefoil increaeed to a greater degree than that of alfalfa with increasing temperature. The greater top growth of birdsfoot trefoil resulted in reduced root-shoot ratios. Birdsfoot trefoil produced less dry matter per cm. ² of leaf area than alfalfa. Root growth of both species increased with increasing applications of P fertilizer. Phosphorus appeared to be more important to growth at low than at high temperatures. Phosphorus and nitrogen uptake by both species increased with increasing soil temperature. Growth chamber studies evaluated the influence of low light intensities and seedling age upon growth of seedlings and distribution of accumulated dry matter. Seedlings gained weight at light intensities of 200 to 800 f. c. With decreasing light intensity, stem elongation occurred at the expense of roots. A smaller percentage of accumulated dry matter went into roots of two-week than in older seedlings. Roots of two-week old seedlings of alfalfa lost weight at 200 f. c. Laboratory studies evaluated oxygen uptake of germinating birdsfoot <b>trefoil</b> and alfalfa <b>seeds.</b> Average oxygen uptake by both species on a per unit weight basis was similar. Alfalfa, due to its greater size, had a greater oxygen uptake on a per plant basis than did birdsfoot trefoil...|$|R
