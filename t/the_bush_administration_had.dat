25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> claimed, {{based on}} the concept of the Laffer Curve, that the tax cuts {{actually}} paid for the themselves by generating enough extra revenue from additional economic growth to offset the lower taxation rates. However, income tax revenues in dollar terms did not regain their FY 2000 peak until 2006. Through the end of 2008, total federal tax revenues relative to GDP had yet to regain their 2000 peak.|$|E

25|$|Secretary Rumsfeld {{assured the}} world that the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were going to be treated in a manner {{consistent}} with the treatment of Geneva Convention POWs. In 2004, confidential memos surfaced that discussed the limits to how much pain, discomfort and fear could be used in the interrogation of detainees in the global war on terror. The memos showed that debate within <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> been resolved in favor of what was later legally determined to be torture.|$|E

25|$|It was {{claimed that}} calls from Western governments for an {{international}} investigation prompted {{a major shift in}} Uzbek foreign policy favouring closer relations with Asian nations, although the Uzbek government is known to have close ties with the U.S. government, and <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> declared Uzbekistan to be vital to US security because it hired out a large military base to US military forces. The Uzbek government ordered the closing of the United States air base in Karshi-Khanabad and improved ties with the People's Republic of China and Russia, who supported the regime's response in Andijan.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{ordnance}} dropped on Iraqi positions by Coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 {{was less than}} in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration. This information {{has been used to}} attempt to refute the theory that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> already decided to go to war against Iraq before coming to office and that the bombing during 2001 and 2002 was laying the groundwork for the eventual invasion in 2003. However, information obtained by the UK Liberal Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq {{in the second half of}} 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6tons in September – before Congress' 11 October authorization of the invasion.|$|E

500|$|Clark, {{coming from}} a non-political background, had no {{position}} papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media, and Clark began to explain his stances {{on a variety of}} issues. He was, as he had told The Washington Post in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He called for a repeal of recent Bush tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new universal health care system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse [...] "scaled down rules" [...] <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> applied to the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and dealing with the potential effects of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, livestock flatulence and other sources. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the PATRIOT Act, and investing $100 billion in homeland security. Finally, he released a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, sharing the cost of the Iraq War with other nations, and cutting government waste.|$|E

The memos were granted only after [...] "repeated requests" [...] from the CIA, who at the time were worried that the White House would eventually try to distance themselves from the issue. Field employees in the agency believed they could easily be blamed for using the techniques without proper written permission or authority.
