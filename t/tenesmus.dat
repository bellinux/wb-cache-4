25|$|Mild disease {{correlates}} {{with fewer than}} four stools daily, with or without blood, no systemic signs of toxicity, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). Mild abdominal pain or cramping may occur. Patients may believe they are constipated {{when in fact they}} are experiencing <b>tenesmus,</b> which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} anatomic {{landmark in}} anal {{cancer is the}} pectinate line (dentate line), which is located about 1–2cm from the anal verge (where the anal mucosa of the anal canal becomes skin). Anal cancers located above this line (towards the head) {{are more likely to}} be carcinomas, whilst those located below (towards the feet) {{are more likely to be}} squamous cell carcinomas that may ulcerate. Anal cancer is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and the sexually transmissible infections HPV and HIV. Anal cancer may be a cause of constipation or <b>tenesmus,</b> or may be felt as a palpable mass, although it may occasionally present as an ulcerative form.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort {{in association with}} frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits. Symptoms usually are experienced as acute attacks that subside within one day, but recurrent attacks are likely. There may also be urgency for bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation (<b>tenesmus),</b> bloating, or abdominal distension. In some cases, the symptoms are relieved by bowel movements. People with IBS, more commonly than others, have gastroesophageal reflux, symptoms relating to the genitourinary system, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, backache, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. About a third {{of men and women}} who have IBS also report sexual dysfunction typically in the form of a reduction in libido.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} stage most often occurs 10–30 days later, but can present {{up to six}} months later. The infection spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in 2/3 of cases) lymphadenitis and lymphangitis, often with tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. Lymphangitis of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex the infected person may experience lymphadenitis and lymphangitis noted above. They may instead develop proctitis, inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, <b>tenesmus,</b> and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of proctitis plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{patients}} typically {{present with}} rectal bleeding, diarrhea, <b>tenesmus</b> (urgent desire {{to evacuate the}} bowels but {{with the passage of}} little stool), and lower abdominal pain. The severity of disease at clinical presentation is important in determining the appropriate therapy. Patients with mildly active disease will have fewer than 4 bowel movements daily and no signs of toxicity. Individuals with moderate-severity UC have more frequent bowel movements with bleeding. Approximately 70% of patients with ulcerative colitis will have moderately active disease at presentation. Patients with severely active disease will have signs of toxicity with fever, tachycardia, and anemia. Patients with fulminant or toxic colitis or toxic megacolon often have more than 10 bowel movements in a day, continuous bleeding, abdominal distention and tenderness, and radiologic evidence of edema and, in some cases, bowel dilation. These people most often require immediate colectomy because 10% have perforated colon at the time of surgery.|$|E

2500|$|This is a {{modification}} of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection. The prolapse is exposed {{if it is not}} already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor. The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. [...] "Mucosal proctectomy" [...] was first discussed by Delorme in 1900, now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse. The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation). Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%–75% of patients). Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased. Constipation is improved in 50% of cases, but often urgency and <b>tenesmus</b> are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, anastomotic dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases. Mortality occurs in 0-2.5% cases. There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).|$|E
50|$|Often, rectal <b>tenesmus</b> {{is simply}} called <b>tenesmus.</b> The term rectal <b>tenesmus</b> is a retronym to {{distinguish}} defecation-related <b>tenesmus</b> from vesical <b>tenesmus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vesical <b>tenesmus</b> {{refers to}} the feeling of {{incomplete}} emptying of the bladder following urination. When the word <b>tenesmus</b> is used without modification, it usually refers to rectal <b>tenesmus.</b> Vesical <b>tenesmus</b> is caused by urogenital diaphragm muscle spasms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tenesmus</b> is {{characterized}} by a sensation of needing to pass stool, accompanied by pain, cramping, and straining. Despite straining, little stool is passed. [...] <b>Tenesmus</b> is generally associated with inflammatory diseases of the bowel, which may be caused by either infectious or noninfectious conditions. Conditions associated with <b>tenesmus</b> include: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenesmus</b> (rectal) is also {{associated}} with the installation of either a reversible or non reversible stoma where rectal disease {{may or may not}} be present. Patients who experience <b>tenesmus</b> as a result of stoma installation can experience the symptoms of <b>tenesmus</b> for the duration of the stoma presence. Long term pain management may need to be considered as a result.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenesmus</b> is {{a closely}} related topic to {{obstructed}} defecation.|$|E
50|$|Obstructed {{defecation}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of chronic constipation. Obstructed defecation could be considered to be a type of bowel obstruction, where it may be classified under large bowel obstruction. Obstructed defecation frequently gives rise to a symptom called <b>tenesmus.</b> Constipation, bowel obstruction and <b>tenesmus</b> are therefore all closely related topics.|$|E
50|$|Vesical <b>tenesmus</b> is {{a similar}} condition, {{experienced}} as a feeling of incomplete voiding despite the bladder being empty.|$|E
5000|$|... {{constipation}} (20-50% of patients) {{also described}} as <b>tenesmus</b> (a sensation of incomplete evacuation of stool) and obstructed defecation.|$|E
50|$|Levator ani {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} characterized by brief intermittent burning pain or <b>tenesmus</b> of the rectal or perineal area.|$|E
50|$|Pain {{relief is}} {{administered}} concomitantly {{to the treatment}} of the primary disease causing <b>tenesmus.</b> Methadone {{has been shown to be}} an effective pain-reliever.|$|E
50|$|Anorectal {{syphilis}} {{is caused}} by Treponema pallidum and is contracted through anoreceptive intercourse. Symptoms are usually minimal, but mucous discharge, bleeding, and <b>tenesmus</b> may be present.|$|E
50|$|Rectal <b>tenesmus</b> (Latin, from Greek teinesmos, from teinein to stretch, strain) is {{a feeling}} of {{incomplete}} defecation. It is the sensation of inability or difficulty to empty the bowel at defecation, even if the bowel contents have already been excreted. <b>Tenesmus</b> indicates {{the feeling of a}} residue, and is not always correlated with the actual presence of residual fecal matter in the rectum. It is frequently painful and may be accompanied by involuntary straining and other gastrointestinal symptoms.Tenesmus has both a nociceptive and a neuropathic component.|$|E
50|$|Gouverneur's {{syndrome}} is characterised by vesicointestinal fistula with associated suprapubic pain, urinary frequency, pain on passing urine, and <b>tenesmus.</b> It {{is named after}} French physician R. Gouverneur.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} {{in patients with}} DLD/NP1 inactivation tumors are rectal prolapse, <b>tenesmus,</b> small bowel obstruction, lingual striated muscle hypertrophy, and priapism. Colonoscopic examination may also reveal [...] "polypy" [...] appearance.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} observed signs associated with Shigella dysentery include colitis, malnutrition, rectal prolapse, <b>tenesmus,</b> reactive arthritis, and {{central nervous system}} problems. Further, S. dysenteriae {{is associated with the}} development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which includes anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.|$|E
50|$|Anal {{carcinoma}} is {{much less}} common than colorectal cancer. The most common form is squamous cell carcinoma, followed by adenocarcinoma and melanoma. SCC usually occurs in the anal canal, and more rarely on the anal margin. Anal margin SCC presents as a lesion with rolled, everted edges and central ulceration. Symptoms include a painful lump, bleeding, pruritus ani, <b>tenesmus,</b> discharge or possibly fecal incontinence. SSC in the anal canal most commonly causes bleeding, but may also cause anal pain, a lump, pruritus ani, discharge, <b>tenesmus,</b> change in bowel habits and fecal incontinence. Because these symptoms are so unspecific, and because symptoms of anal carcinoma {{may not always be}} typical, this can lead to delays in diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} may range from mild abdominal discomfort to full-blown dysentery characterized by cramps, diarrhea, with slimy-consistent stools, fever, blood, pus, or mucus in stools or <b>tenesmus.</b> Onset time is 12 to 96 hours, and recovery takes 5 to 7 days.|$|E
50|$|Adenoma is {{the most}} common {{colorectal}} polyp. Adenomas are not malignant, but rarely adenocarcinoma can develop from them. Large adenomas can cause rectal bleeding, mucus discharge, <b>tenesmus,</b> and a sensation of urgency. Mucus production may be so great that it can cause electrolyte disturbances in the blood.|$|E
50|$|The most typical {{signs are}} seen in the {{digestive}} tract. When entering an affected flock, one sees many animals with hind limbs stained by sticky faeces. Some sheep have an arched back and show pain when defecating. <b>Tenesmus</b> may be noticed when taking rectal temperature. Fluid faeces are olive green to brown.|$|E
50|$|A {{common cause}} of perineal hernia is surgery {{involving}} the perineum. Perineal hernia can be caused also by excessive straining to defecate (<b>tenesmus).</b> Other causes include prostate or urinary disease, constipation, anal sac disease (in dogs), and diarrhea. Atrophy of the levator ani muscle and disease of the pudendal nerve may also contribute to a perineal hernia.|$|E
50|$|Anal sacs may {{be removed}} surgically in a {{procedure}} known as anal sacculectomy. This is usually {{done in the}} case of recurrent infection or {{because of the presence of}} an anal sac adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. Potential complications include fecal incontinence (especially when both glands are removed), <b>tenesmus</b> from stricture or scar formation, and persistent draining fistulae.|$|E
50|$|Rectal gonorrhea {{is caused}} by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (also Neisseria meninigitidis). The {{condition}} is usually asymptomatic, but symptoms can include rectal discharge (which can be creamy, purulent or bloody), pruritus ani, <b>tenesmus,</b> and possibly constipation. When symptomatic, these usually appear 5-7 days post exposure. Discharge {{is the most common}} symptom, and it is usually a brownish mucopurulent consistency.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{may include}} {{multiple}} vesicles that rupture to form ulcers, <b>tenesmus,</b> rectal pain, discharge, hematochezia. The disease may run its natural course of exacerbations and remissions but is usually more prolonged and severe {{in patients with}} immunodeficiency disorders. Presentations may resemble dermatitis or decubitus ulcers in debilitated, bedridden patients. A secondary bacterial infection may be present.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{intestinal}} disease (dà cháng bìng) {{is attributable}} to evils such as heat, cold, stagnation, dampness, and wind, or to vacuity. Rumbling intestines or pain around the umbilicus, constipation or diarrhea, bloody stool or <b>tenesmus</b> with blood and pus in the stool, and prolapse of the rectum are signs of large intestine disease. The main patterns are listed below: ...|$|E
5000|$|Xianglian Wan [...] (...) is a {{pale yellow}} to {{yellowish}} brown pill used in Traditional Chinese medicine to [...] "eliminate damp-heat, promote {{the flow of}} qi and relieve pain". It is slightly aromatic and tastes bitter. It is used when there are symptoms of [...] "dysentery with <b>tenesmus,</b> abdominal pain and diarrhea". The binding agent of the pill is honey.|$|E
50|$|In {{the initial}} study it is {{interesting}} to note that, in the population examined in this scale, the type 1 and 2 stools were more prevalent in females, while the type 5 and 6 stools were more prevalent in males; furthermore, 80% of subjects who reported rectal <b>tenesmus</b> (urgency to defecate) had type 7. These and other data have allowed the scale to be validated.|$|E
5000|$|Acute {{radiation}} proctitis [...] - [...] symptoms {{occur in}} the first few weeks after therapy. These symptoms include diarrhea and the urgent need to defecate, often with pain while doing so (<b>tenesmus).</b> Acute radiation proctitis usually resolves without treatment after several months, but symptoms may improve with butyrate enemas. This acute phase is due to direct damage of the lining (epithelium) of the colon.|$|E
50|$|Tritrichomonas blagburni is a {{single-celled}} eukaryote {{that moves}} with whip-like flagella {{located on the}} exterior of its cell membrane. It is transmitted between cattle through sexual activity and infects the reproductive tract. In cats, it infects the digestive tract, causing chronic diarrhea, <b>tenesmus,</b> flatulence and fecal incontinence. It {{is only the second}} species described in the reproductive tract of cattle and the intestine of cats.|$|E
