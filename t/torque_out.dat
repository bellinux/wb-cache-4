40|$|A {{combination}} of analytic models and n-body simulations {{implies that the}} structural evolution of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is dominated by its dynamical interaction with the Milky Way. Although expected at some level, {{the scope of the}} involvement has significant observational consequences. First, LMC disk orbits are <b>torqued</b> <b>out</b> of the disk plane, thickening the disk and populating a spheroid. The torque results from direct forcing by the Milky Way tide and, indirectly, from the drag between the LMC disk and its halo resulting from the induced precession of the LMC disk. The latter is a newly reported mechanism that can affect all satellite interactions. However, the overall torque does not isotropize the stellar orbits, and their kinematics remains disklike. Such a kinematic signature is observed for nearly all LMC populations. The extended disk distribution is predicted to increase the microlensing toward the LMC. Second, the disk 2 ̆ 7 s binding energy slowly decreases during this process, puffing up and priming the outer regions for subsequent tidal stripping. Because the tidally stripped debris will be spatially extended, the distribution of stripped stars is much more extended than the H I Magellanic Stream. This is consistent with upper limits to stellar densities in the gas stream and suggests a different strategy for detecting the stripped stars. Finally, the mass loss over several LMC orbits is predicted by n-body simulation, and the debris extends to tens of kiloparsecs from the tidal boundary. Although the overall space density of the stripped stars is low, the possible existence of such intervening populations has recently been reported and may be detectable using 2 MASS...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{motion control}} and power {{conversion}} applications, {{the use of}} inverter-fed electrical machines is fast growing with continuous development {{in the field of}} power electronics and drives. The Variable Voltage Variable Frequency (VVVF) supply for electrical machines gives superior performance in terms of speed control, efficiency and dynamics compared to the machines operated directly from the mains. In one of the most basic configurations, a drive system consists of a closed loop speed control that has a current controller inside the loop. For effective and stable current control, the controller gains need to be set according to the parameters of the machine at hand. Besides, accurate parameter information is helpful in ensuring better machine exploitation as well as maintaining higher efficiency in various operating modes and conditions. The traditional methods of determining machine parameters consist of extensive machine testing under prescribed supply and ambient conditions. These methods become impracticable when the machine cannot be isolated from its load or the test equipment cannot be made available. Under such conditions, the alternatives are needed that use only the available hardware included in a standard drive to completely define the machine parameters. Self-commissioning thus comes into play in such situations. The automatic determination of machine electrical parameters before the drive is put in continuous operation is called self-commissioning of the drive system. In this thesis, self-commissioning of AC electric motors is studied, analyzed and results are presented for the implementation of different self-commissioning methods either proposed in the literature or developed {{in the course of this}} research. By far the commonest control strategy of AC machines is the vector control that allows dc machine like decoupled control of machine flux and torque. The separation of flux and torque producing current components depends heavily on the parameters of the machine at hand. In case the parameters fed to the controller do not match the actual machine parameters, the control performance deteriorates both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. For synchronous machines using permanent magnets, the magnetic model of the machine is important both for flux estimation accuracy at low speeds and for deriving maximum <b>torque</b> <b>out</b> of machine per ampere of input stator current. The identification of the magnetic model of permanent magnet synchronous machines requires special tests in a laboratory environment by loading the machine. A number of machine parameter identification methods have been studied in the past and proposed in the literature. As the power amplifier implied is almost always an inverter, the estimation of machine parameters at start-up by generating special test signals through the inverter have been researched in depth and are investigated in this thesis. These techniques are termed as offline parameter identification strategies. Other methods that focus on parameter updating during routine machine operation are called online parameter estimation methods. In this thesis, only the offline identification schemes are studied and explored further. With continuous improvements in power semiconductor devices' switching speeds and more powerful microprocessors being used for the control of electric drives, generating a host of test signals has been made possible. Analysing the machine response to the injected test signals using enhanced computational power onboard is relatively easier. These conditions favour the use of even more complex test strategies and algorithms for self-commissioning and to reduce the time required for conducting these tests. Moreover, the universal design of electric drives renders the self commissioning algorithms easily adaptable for different machine types used in industry. Among a number of AC machines available on the market, the most widely used in industrial drives are considered for study here. These include AC induction and permanent magnet synchronous machines. Induction machines still play a major part in industrial processes due, largely, to their ruggedness and maintenance-freeness; however, the permanent magnet machines are fast replacing them as competitive alternatives because of their low volume-to-power, weight-to-power ratios and higher efficiency. Their relatively light weight makes these machines a preferred choice in traction and propeller applications over their asynchronous counterpart...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} {{providing}} a basic introduction of electricity requirements for small developing country communities serviced by small scale generating units (focussing mainly on small wind turbine, small Photo Voltaic system and Micro-Hydro Power Plants). Scenarios {{of these small}} scale units {{around the world are}} presented. Companies manufacturing different size wind turbines are surveyed in order to propose a design that suits the most abundantly available and affordable turbines. Different Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms normally employed for these small scale generating units are listed along with their working principles. Most of these algorithms for MPPT do not require any mechanical sensors in order to sense the control parameters like wind speed and rotor speed (for small wind turbines), temperature and irradiation (for PV systems), and water flow and water head (for Micro-Hydro). Models for all three of these systems were developed in order to generate Maximum Power Point (MPP) curves. Similarly, a model for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (PMSGs) has been developed in the d-q reference frame. A boost rectifier which enables active Power Factor Correction (PFC) and has a DC regulated output voltage is proposed before implementing a MPPT algorithm. The proposed boost rectifier works on the principle of Direct Power Control Space Vector Modulation (DPC-SVM) which is based on instantaneous active and reactive power control loops. In this technique, the switching states are determined according to the errors between commanded and estimated values of active and reactive powers. The PMSG and Wind Turbine behaviour are simulated at various wind speeds. Similarly, simulation of the proposed PFC boost rectifier is performed in matlab/simulink. The output of these models are observed for the variable wind speeds which identifies PFC and boosted constant DC output voltage is obtained. A buck converter that employs the MPPT algorithm is proposed and modeled. The model of a complete system that consists of a variable speed small wind turbine, PMSG, DPC-SVM boost rectifier, and buck converter implementing MPPT algorithm is developed. The proposed MPPT algorithm is based upon the principle of adjusting the duty ratio of the buck converter in order reach the MPP for different wind speeds (for small wind turbines) and different water flow rates (Micro-Hydro). Finally, a prototype DPC-SVM boost rectifier and buck converter was designed and built for a turbine with an output power ranging from 50 W- 1 kW. Inductors for the boost rectifier and buck DC-DC converter were designed and built for these output power ranges. A microcontroller was programmed in order to generate three switching signals for the PFC boost rectifier and one switching signal for the MPPT buck converter. Three phase voltages and currents were sensed to determine active and reactive power. The voltage vectors were divided into 12 sectors and a switching algorithm based on the DPC-SVM boost rectifier model was implemented in order to minimize the errors between commanded and estimated values of active and reactive power. The system was designed for charging 48 V battery bank. The generator three phase voltage is boosted to a constant 80 V DC. Simulation results of the DPC-SVM based rectifier shows that the output power could be varied by varying the DC load maintaining UPF and constant boosted DC voltage. A buck DC-DC converter is proposed after the boost rectifier stage in order to charge the 48 V battery bank. Duty ratio of the buck converter is varied for varying the output power in order to reach the MPP. The controller prototype was designed and developed. A laboratory setup connecting 4 kW induction motor (behaving as a wind turbine) with 1 kW PMSG was built. Speed-torque characteristic of the induction motor is initially determined. The <b>torque</b> <b>out</b> of the motor varies with the motor speed at various motor supply voltages. At a particular supply voltage, the motor torque reaches peak power at a certain turbine speed. Hence, the control algorithm is tested to reach this power point. Although the prototype of the entire system was built, complete results were not obtained due to various time constraints. Results from the boost rectifier showed that the appropriate switching were performed according to the digitized signals of the active and reactive power errors for different voltage sectors. Simulation results showed that for various wind speed, a constant DC voltage of 80 V DC is achieved along with UPF. MPPT control algorithm was tested for induction motor and PMSG combination. Results showed that the MPPT could be achieved by varying the buck converter duty ratio with UPF achieved at various wind speeds...|$|E

Experimental evaluation of the PJP was carried out through experiments in a Wind Tunnel Facility (WTF) using momentum defect principle for propulsive performance prior to proceeding with extensive experimental evaluation in towing tank and cavitation tunnel. Experiments were particularly conducted with respect to Self Propulsion Point (SPP), residual torque and thrust characteristics over a range of vehicle advance ratio in order to ascertain whether sufficient thrust is developed at the design condition with least possible imbalance <b>torque</b> left <b>out</b> due to residual swirl in the slip stream. Pumpjet and body models were developed for the propulsion tests using Aluminum alloy forged material. Tests were conducted from 0 m/s to 30 m/s at four rotational speeds of the PJP.

We introduce an effective temperature based on a stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. In the limit of high energy barriers, the law of thermal agitation is derived. We find that the Néel-Brown relaxation formula remains valid as long as we replace the temperature by an effective one that is linearly dependent of the spin <b>torque.</b> We carry <b>out</b> the numerical integration of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation to support our theory. Our results agree with existing experimental data. Comment: 5 figure...|$|R
