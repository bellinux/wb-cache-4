5|$|The jacanas are a {{group of}} {{tropical}} waders in the family Jacanidae. They are found worldwide within the <b>tropical</b> <b>zone.</b> They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.|$|E
5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} largely {{tropical}} waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the <b>tropical</b> <b>zone,</b> with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.|$|E
5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the <b>tropical</b> <b>zone,</b> virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

25|$|However, many meteorologists {{argue that}} the monsoon is not a local {{phenomenon}} as explained by the traditional theory, but a general weather phenomenon along the entire <b>tropical</b> <b>zone</b> of Earth.

25|$|The Central Plateau is {{well within}} the <b>tropical</b> <b>zone,</b> but {{altitude}} {{and the effect of}} the southwestern Antarctic current combine to produce a moderate climate. The annual variation of temperature is small, with maximum temperatures varying between 17 and 28°C during much of the year. The average maximum is approximately 22°C. During the winter months (May–July), temperatures may reach as low as 5 to 8°C. Mean annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1600mm, according to region. In the Central Plateau, seasonal rains begin with a few showers during September, increase during October and November, have a break of two to four weeks in December, January or February, and continue until the end of April. The heaviest rainfall is usually in November or December.|$|E
