6000|$|I {{have been}} a prey to agitations and complications, many assaults, invasions and inconveniences, since leaving town--whereby I have had to put off thanking you for two {{brilliant}} letters. And yet I have wanted to write--to tell you (explaining) how I found myself swallowed up by one social abyss after another, and tangled in a succession of artful feminine webs, at Stafford House that evening, so that I couldn't get into touch with you, or with Ethel, again, before you were gone, as I found when I finally made a dash for you. That too was very complicated, and evening-parties bristle with dangers.... The very critical business of the final luminous copy is, how ever, coming to an end--I mean <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> <b>at</b> the utterly last intense reductions and compressions. So much has to come out, however, that I am sickened and appalled--and this sacrifice of the very life-blood of one's play, the mere vulgar anatomy and bare-bones poverty to which one has to squeeze it more and more, is the nauseating side of the whole desperate job. In spite of which I am interesting myself deeply in the three act comedy I have undertaken for Frohman--and which I find ferociously difficult--but with a difficulty that, thank God, draws me on and fascinates. If I can go on believing in my subject I can go on treating it; but sometimes I have a mortal chill and wonder if I ain't damnably deluded. However, the balance inclines to faith and I think it works out. You shall hear what comes of it--even at the worst. Meanwhile for yourself, dearest Lucy, buck up and patiently woo the Muse. She responds at last always to true and faithful wooing--to the right artful patience--and turns upon one the smile from which light breaks. I have been reading over the Long Duel (which I immediately return)--with a sense of its having great charm and care of execution, and quality and grace, but also, dear Lucy, of its drawbacks for practical prosperity. The greatest of these {{seems to me to}} be fundamental--to reside in the fact that the subject isn't dramatic, that it deals with a state, a position, a situation (of the [...] "static" [...] kind), and not, save in a very minor degree, with an action, a progression; which fact, highly favourable to it for a tale, a psychologic picture, is detrimental to its tenseness--to its being matter for a play and developed into 4 acts. A play appears to me of necessity to involve a struggle, a question (of whether, and how, will it or won't it happen? and if so, or not so, how and why?--which we have the suspense, the curiosity, the anxiety, the tension, in a word, of seeing; and which means that the whole thing shows an attack upon oppositions--with the victory or the failure on one side or the other, and each wavering and shifting, from point to point.) But your hero is thus not an agent, he is passive, he doesn't take the field. I say all this because I think there is light on the matter of the history of the fate of the play in it--and also think that there are other elements of disadvantage for the piece too. The elderly (or almost?) French artist with a virtuous love-sorrow doesn't, for the B.P., belong to the actual; he's romantic, and old-fashionedly romantic, and remote; and the case is aggravated by the corresponding maturity of the heroine. You will say that there is the young couple, and what comes of their being there, and their [...] "action"; but the truth about that, I fear, is that innocent young lovers as such, and not as being engaged in other difficulties and with other oppositions (of their own,) have practically ceased to be a dramatic value--aren't any longer an element or an interest to conjure with. Don't hate me for saying these things--for working them out critically, and so far as may be, illuminatingly, in face of the difficulty the L.D. seems to have had in getting itself brought out. We are dealing with an art prodigiously difficult and arduous every way--and in which one seems most of all to sink into a Sea of colossal Waste. I'm not sure that The Other House, after all my not-to-be-reckoned labour and calculation on it, isn't (to be) wasted. But these are dreary words--it is much past midnight. I am damned critical--for it's the only thing to be, and all else is damned humbug. But I don't mean a douche of cold water, and am ever so tenderly and faithfully yours, ...|$|E

The Chincha had no trouble recognizing the Inca and continue living peacefully in their dominion. The next emperor, Topa Inca Yupanqui (ruled 1471-93) brought the Chincha Kingdom into a true territorial annexation to the empire, but the rulers of Chincha retained much of their political and economic autonomy and their traditional leadership. The Chincha king was required to spend several months each year attending the court of the Inca emperor, although he was given the honors of the highest Inca nobles.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify what "the {{overcoming}} of suffering" at which the fundamental Buddhism aims is. The overcoming of suffering is the state that becomes possible in "Nirvana(nibbƒÅna) ". What is this? According to a predominant opinion of today's Buddhism study, it is a state of the mind of man from whom desire and evil passion disappear. Therefore, Buddhism reasons that these should be eliminated in order to realize the overcoming of suffering and thus the state of Nirvana. However, Sakyamuni considers the Nirvana to be a certain root truth that is called "Holy Truth (ariyasacca) ". It is a transcendent place that has no phenomenon at all. Nevertheless, it is not excluded from all phenomena but is in all phenomena. How should we arrive at such a Nirvana for the overcoming of suffering? Sakyamuni explains "concentration(samƒÅdhi) " as "the road that arrives at the Nirvana". Concentration on a certain phenomenon realizes its truth. And this truth is the Nirvana. Also, to realize the Nirvana by concentration to a phenomenon is to arrive at the Nirvana as to overcome suffering. Thus, the overcoming of suffering is the realizing of the Nirvana as <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> <b>at</b> the Nirvana, and this happens in a concentration on a phenomenon. Therefore, the overcoming of suffering is, as for our more concrete way of living, the devoting ourselves to our given life and the living in it sincerely. This rather exceeds our life and suffering...|$|E
