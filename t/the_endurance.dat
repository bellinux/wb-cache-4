5|$|After {{returning}} to Britain in November 1916, Crean resumed naval duties. On 15 December 1916 {{he was promoted}} to the rank of warrant officer (as a boatswain), in recognition of his service on <b>the</b> <b>Endurance,</b> and was awarded his third Polar Medal. On 5 September 1917, Crean married Ellen Herlihy of Annascaul. In early 1920, Shackleton was organising another Antarctic expedition, later {{to be known as the}} Shackleton-Rowett Expedition. He invited Crean to join him, along with other officers from <b>the</b> <b>Endurance.</b> By this time, however, Crean's second daughter had arrived, and he had plans to open a business following his naval career. He turned down Shackleton's invitation. On his last naval assignment, with HMS Hecla, Crean suffered a bad fall which caused lasting effects to his vision. As a result, he was retired on medical grounds on 24 March 1920. He and Ellen opened a small public house in Annascaul, which he called The South Pole Inn. The couple had three daughters, Mary, Kate, and Eileen, although Kate died when she was four years old.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. <b>The</b> <b>endurance</b> of the Principate is {{challenged}} in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus.

He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, <b>the</b> <b>Endurance,</b> was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea.

40|$|Background: Low {{cardiorespiratory}} <b>endurance</b> {{will decrease}} <b>the</b> speed and skill in playing soccer. Good cardiorespiratory endurance is {{important factor in}} exercise and competition to reach the optimal achievement of the PS. Semen Padang soccer team players. Protein and Fe constitute a supporting factor in forming hemoglobin which is needed for increasing <b>the</b> cardiorespiratory <b>endurance.</b> Objective: This study was aimed at fi nding out the correlation between protein and Fe consumption patterns with <b>the</b> cardiorespiratory <b>endurance</b> of Semen Padang soccer team players in 2003. Methods: This was cross-sectional design of 23 PS. Semen Padang soccer team players. The variables were protein and Fe consumption patterns, hemoglobin concentration and cardiorespiratory <b>endurance.</b> <b>The</b> analysis method was regression Chi-square, multiple linier, and partial correlation. Results: There was no correlation between protein (p= 0, 683) and Fe (p= 0, 168) consumption patterns with hemoglobin concentration; there was correlation between hemoglobin concentration with <b>the</b> cardiorespiratory <b>endurance</b> (p= 0, 022); there was no correlation between protein consumption pattern (p= 0, 395) with the cardiorespiratory endurance; there was significant correlation between Fe consumption pattern with <b>the</b> cardiorespiratory <b>endurance</b> (p= 0, 009).

5|$|Worsley, in London while {{awaiting}} a new berth, joined the expedition {{as a result}} of a dream, in which he was navigating a ship around icebergs drifting down Burlington Street. He took it as a premonition and the next day hurried down to Burlington Street, where he noticed a sign on a building advertising what Shackleton called the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. He promptly entered the building whereupon he met Shackleton. After a few minutes of conversation, Shackleton offered him the captaincy of <b>the</b> <b>Endurance,</b> which Worsley accepted.|$|E
5|$|Approval {{was given}} on 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of the}} AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, <b>the</b> <b>endurance</b> requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E

5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, {{a small part}} of the ice floe broke away and he was only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of the men of the next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety.

Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of <b>the</b> <b>Endurance,</b> as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions.

In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool would not have <b>the</b> <b>endurance</b> required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match. Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the only difference between the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC.

5|$|Experience during {{operations}} later led to {{the development}} of specialised armoured equipment by Australian industry for use in jungle operations in the South West Pacific Area. A range of modifications were subsequently developed for the Matilda, including the fitting of wire mesh screens or metal tracking over the engine and air louvres to protect it against magnetic mines, an armoured shield on top of the hull to protect the turret ring, a microphone and headset attached to the rear to act as a telephone for infantry co-operation, waterproofing equipment for deep wading, a tank dozer, a flamethrowing tank called the Matlida Frog, and one capable of firing a salvo of naval mortar bombs, known as the Matilda Hedgehog. The Frog was capable of projecting a flame , while the Hedgehog was designed to fire multiple projectiles at concrete blockhouses. Used in combat in the final year of the war in support of Australian infantry at Balipapan, the Frog proved a successful adaptation. Trials were also undertaken to fit air conditioning to the Matildas to improve <b>the</b> <b>endurance</b> of crews in tropical conditions. Limited modifications were also undertaken on the M3 Grant medium tanks, including the fitting of a small number of dozer variants and trials to waterproof the vehicles for wading.|$|E

5|$|Finnhorses {{are popular}} as {{recreational}} riding horses, and well-suited for use at riding schools, trekking, and riding therapy.

5|$|This National War Museum Committee {{set about}} {{collecting}} material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, {{the production of}} munitions, and women's war work. There was an early appreciation {{of the need for}} exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and <b>the</b> <b>endurance</b> of individuals'. The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig, who reportedly took great interest in his work.
