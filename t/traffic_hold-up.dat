5000|$|I {{had gone}} to UK in 1995 as Deputy Leader of the Indian Delegation {{to take part in}} the 50th Anniversary {{celebrations}} of the victory in Europe during the Second World War. I, along with four other Army officers, had just stepped out after attending the inaugural session and were waiting on the roadside for the traffic to ease so as to walk across the road to the vehicle park. Among those with me was Honorary Captain Umrao Singh, a Victoria Cross winner. All of a sudden, a car moving on the road came to a halt in front of us and a well-dressed gentleman stepped out. He approached Umrao Singh and said, [...] "Sir, may I have the privilege of shaking hands with the Victoria Cross (winner)?" [...] He shook hands with him. Evidently he had spotted Umrao Singh's medal from his car and had stopped his car to pay his respect to a winner of the highest gallantry medal of his country. Then he looked at me and said, [...] "General, you are from the Indian Army." [...] When I replied in the affirmative, he gave out his name, saying that he was Michael Heseltine. I was absolutely astounded, as the recognition dawned on me that he was the Deputy Prime Minister of the UK. I was totally overawed by such courtesy shown by a dignitary of the second highest status in the British Government, and humbly thanked him for having invited our delegation for the VE-Day function. Again, his reply was typical of his sagacity, [...] "General, it is we, the British, who should be grateful to your country and your Armed Forces, who had helped us win both the First and the Second world wars. How can we be ever so ungrateful to forget your country's great contribution?" [...] Suddenly I became conscious that all the traffic behind his car had come to stand still. I hurried to thank him and politely requested him to move along to relieve the <b>traffic</b> <b>hold-up.</b> He stated, [...] "Sir, how dare I drive off when the Victoria Cross has to cross the road." [...] Realizing his genuine feeling I and my colleagues quickly crossed the road. Reaching the other side I looked back and saw that Mr. Hailstine was still standing waiting for the Victoria Cross to be safely across.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the {{spatial distribution of}} informal sector activities in the ancient city of Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. Information were obtained from 555 operators of informal activities along the Federal, State and Local roads, as well as within the traditional, transition and sub-urban residential zones in the study area. The study established that the informal sector activities in the city were indiscriminately located along the major street corridors (Federal and State roads) as well as within the transition residential zone. The study asserts that this distribution {{is due to the}} fact that many of the activities/land uses that have the potential of attracting people were located in these areas. Such activities/land uses include; the major market, the central business district, banks, hospitals, students ‟ hostels and high schools. This pattern of distribution has such effects as; on-street parking of vehicles, <b>traffic</b> <b>hold-up</b> and unsanitary environmental condition among others. The study concluded that it is imperative to check and prevent further indiscriminate location of informal sector activities so as to ensure sustainable development. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{live in an}} era {{in which}} speed is the guiding {{principle}} of progress and efficiency. The right choice of traffic signalisation and equipment in road traffic is therefore very important because it ensures that traffic is fast and safe as well as economical. The paper presents the influence of human factor on visibility, which is a major guideline in choice and instalment of signalisation. There is {{a detailed description of the}} reflection of light and providing retroreflection in various weather conditions and times of the day. Following more and more demands regarding traffic safety and economy, the technology of materials for road surface marking has developed. I presented the types of road surface marking and the procedures of application. I described the procedures of ascertaining the conformity of products with required standards. In the conclusion, I compared the costs of use of various types of marking from the viewpoint of retroreflexion, useful life of a product and <b>traffic</b> <b>hold-ups</b> due to roadworks...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the feasibility of using existing international developed compositions of furfuryl alcohol polymer concrete in South African applications. Problems were encountered with these formulations and modifications were {{required in order to}} enhance the application possibilities of the material. After these modifications were made, tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} temperature, humidity, specimen size and variations in constituent quantities on the polymerisation reaction and properties of the material. Engineering characteristics, such as, compressive strength and durability were investigated and large scale field tests were performed to demonstrate the feasibility and simplicity of using polymer concrete. The final mix design selected for use in South Africa, polymerised within 20 minutes obtaining a compressive strength of 20 MPa in that period. This material proved stable under adverse chemical conditions and was able to withstand elevated temperatures of up to 200 °C. Tests on road pothole rehabilitation slabs showed that polymer concrete can resist high stresses successfully under repeated loads and can be installed in less than 30 minutes in order to minimize <b>traffic</b> <b>hold-ups.</b> Furfuryl alcohol polymer concrete can be made at a cost of approximately 50 c/kg and proves to be cost-effective when compared with epoxies...|$|R
40|$|Globally, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} chronic illnesses. Managing T 2 DM is a major challenge now affecting the lives of around 200 million people. Even when medication, diet, and physical activity regimens are maintained, blood sugar levels might not be effectively controlled because stress triggers the release of sugar into the blood. This makes the management of stress an important adjunct to the treatment of T 2 DM. Stress includes both life stress, the major issues that people face in their lives, such as job loss, divorce, or death of a loved one, and daily hassles, smaller everyday problems, such as deadlines for work, <b>traffic</b> <b>hold-ups,</b> or family disagreements. The stress levels created by these events are exacerbated by the stress created by the demands of managing diabetes. In this paper, we first examine the evidence for the relationship between stress and poor blood sugar control in people with T 2 DM. Then, we consider research that has examined the impact of various stress management strategies on blood sugar level. Finally, we discuss some promising psychological techniques for managing stress that could be helpful for people with diabetes or pre-diabetes. We note the double benefit of physical activity, which directly assists in the metabolism of sugar from the blood and indirectly reduces acute stress and chronic stress reactivity, thus providing a buffer against the effects of stress for people with T 2 DM...|$|R
25|$|Within {{the large}} cities, roads become {{congested}} in peak hours. The M8 and M77 motorways become heavily congested in peak hours, especially around Glasgow where it travels {{through the heart}} of the city. The main congestion hotposts are in Glasgow City Centre around the Kingston Bridge where a large amount of traffic leaves and enter the road. Also further down the road traffic joining at Hillington Estate and Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow Airport can cause <b>hold-ups.</b> <b>Traffic</b> is also extremely heavy between Glasgow and Edinburgh at all times, however rarely comes to a standstill.|$|R
