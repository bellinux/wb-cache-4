5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} {{during the height of}} the nature fakers controversy, and it has been suggested that De Esque elected to release Betelguese, a Trip <b>Through</b> <b>Hell</b> while Theodore Roosevelt was on a trip to Africa in an effort to avoid potential conflict that might have resulted from Roosevelt's awareness of its content.|$|E
5|$|Betelguese, a Trip <b>Through</b> <b>Hell</b> was {{published}} by Connoisseur's Press in Jersey City, New Jersey on July 1, 1908. An application for copyright was submitted on September 28, 1907. Two copies were received by the Library of Congress on August 28, 1909. For the publishing company, Betelguese was considered its first work of distinction {{after several years of}} modest publications.|$|E
5|$|In a {{research}} facility on Mars {{owned by the}} Union Aerospace Corporation, facility director Samuel Hayden's mind now inhabits an android body after having lost his original to brain cancer. Researchers attempted to draw energy from Hell in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth using the Argent Tower, which siphons energy and allows travel to and from Hell. Hayden has already led multiple expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. One artifact was a sarcophagus containing the Doom Slayer (along with his Praetor Suit), whom the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage <b>through</b> <b>Hell.</b>|$|E

5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey <b>through</b> <b>Hell</b> to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities and differences between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E

25|$|Written in {{the first}} person, the poem tells of Dante's journey through the three realms of the dead, lasting {{from the night before}} Good Friday to the Wednesday after Easter in the spring of 1300. The Roman poet Virgil guides him <b>through</b> <b>Hell</b> and Purgatory; Beatrice, Dante's ideal woman, guides him through Heaven. Beatrice was a Florentine woman whom he had met in {{childhood}} and admired from afar in the mode of the then-fashionable courtly love tradition, which is highlighted in Dante's earlier work La Vita Nuova.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian and United States governments {{formed the}} Pacific Salmon Convention (PSC) of 1937, which created the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC) (now the Pacific Salmon Commission). The IPSFC carried out {{extensive}} research, and as {{based on their}} findings they recommended that fishways be constructed to help migrating salmon pass <b>through</b> <b>Hells</b> Gate. Building of the fishways began in 1944.|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1860s {{there was}} a mining boom {{in the area of}} Boise, Idaho. The Oregon Steam Navigation Company had tried to run a {{steamboat}}, the Colonel Wright, up the Snake River <b>through</b> <b>Hells</b> Canyon, but this proved impossible. As an alternative, O.S.N. decided to build a steamboat on the upper Snake River; this vessel, the Shoshone, was launched in 1866 at Old Fort Boise, Idaho.|$|R

25|$|Commonwealths {{most serious}} {{accident}} {{in terms of}} human cost occurred on the morning of December 19, 1860, about 5am. While waiting for daylight, to pass safely <b>through</b> <b>Hell</b> Gate, a defective plate in Commonwealths steam chimney burst, allowing steam into the starboard fireroom. When the firemen opened the door to make their escape, a gust of wind diverted the steam into a group of passengers on deck. A family of four from Dublin, the Blakes, were all scalded, the mother so badly she was not expected to recover. A young colored waiter who ran out on deck at the same moment was fatally scalded by inhalation. Two other passengers were also scalded. At an inquest held two days later, the cause of the explosion was determined to be corrosion of the steam chimney, and an accidental finding returned.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{structure of}} the play {{is very much in}} keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-kyū is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyū). Also, Sugawara follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act One begins calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat and murder. Act Three is something of a sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, turning away from the affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four, often in other plays a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey <b>through</b> <b>hell,</b> features a dramatic storm and an emotional journey for Kan Shōjō, who becomes enraged at the traitorous activities of Shihei, and kills himself, becoming a thunder god. Act Five wraps up the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness.|$|E

50|$|In 1953, Stubblefield instituted an {{operation}} running passenger boats downstream <b>through</b> <b>Hells</b> Canyon. He used a 31-foot, twin-propeller boat called Chief Joseph at first, then upgraded to several 33-foot converted Army bridge pontoon boats with 25-horsepower outboard engines. The boat trips began at Homestead and ended at Lewiston, Idaho—a trip of 150 miles. This {{was the first}} operation to regularly provide passenger tours <b>through</b> <b>Hells</b> Canyon, and operated six months each year. The trip took from three days to a week. Passengers brought along camping equipment and set up camp on shore each night. Upon reaching Lewiston, the boats were trucked back to their starting point. It was impossible {{to go all the}} way back upstream on the river. The asking price was a $500 minimum (equivalent to $4000 in 2010 dollars) for one or two passengers with $200 for each additional passenger. This was for a full week's cruise—side trips were possible—and included food, refreshments, and a trip back to Weiser by car or airplane. Stubblefield's operation provided some cargo service for prospectors, ranchers and miners at remote spots along the way, but the tourist trade was the major part of Stubblefield's business.|$|R

2500|$|Canadian {{zoologist}} William Ricker, {{who was one}} of {{the scientists}} originally employed by the IPFSC, became an outspoken critic of the decision to build fishways and of Thompson’s research. Ricker challenged the foundational finding of Thompson’s research: that only 20% of fish could pass <b>through</b> <b>Hells</b> Gate. [...] He claimed that these data were so selective that they were unreliable and misleading. Two reasons for this, which Ricker believed could have been easily overcome with adjustments to research methods, were that the fish tagged would have been from a highly selective sample of weaker fish than average, and that tagging itself may impede a fish’s ability to subsequently swim through the rapid water at Hells Gate. Ricker stated that Thompson did not properly address these issues, and that therefore “they may be sufficient to completely invalidate the conclusion that” Hells Gate is a serious obstacle for salmon migration. Ricker also challenged other aspects of Thompson’s research, including his assumptions about the causal relationship between water levels and successful passage <b>through</b> <b>Hells</b> Gate. He further argued that there appears to be evidence (based on sex ratios above and below Hells Gate) to suggest that no significant obstruction existed after the initial clean up.|$|R
