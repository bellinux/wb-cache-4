5|$|In {{the written}} {{language}} {{and more recently}} also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past. That is, they might arguably mark <b>time</b> <b>reference,</b> but not yet systematically.|$|E
25|$|The term tense, then, {{particularly}} in less formal contexts, is sometimes used to denote {{any combination of}} tense proper, aspect, and mood. As regards English, there are many verb forms and constructions which combine <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> with continuous and/or perfect aspect, and with indicative, subjunctive or conditional mood. Particularly in some English language teaching materials, {{some or all of}} these forms can be referred to simply as tenses (see below).|$|E
25|$|Korean verbs have {{a variety}} of affixed forms which can be {{described}} as representing present, past and future tenses, although they can alternatively be considered to be aspectual. Similarly, Japanese verbs are described as having present and past tenses, although they may be analysed as aspects. Chinese and many other East Asian languages generally lack inflection and are considered to be tenseless languages, although they may have aspect markers which convey certain information about <b>time</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{linguistic}} {{metaphors of}} time appear to influence how people gesture about time. This study finds that Chinese English bilinguals produce more vertical gestures {{when talking about}} Chinese <b>time</b> <b>references</b> with vertical spatial metaphors than (1) when talking about time conceptions in the English translations, and (2) when talking about Chinese <b>time</b> <b>references</b> with no spatial metaphors. Additionally, Chinese English bilinguals prefer vertical gestures to lateral gestures when perceiving Chinese <b>time</b> <b>references</b> with vertical spatial metaphors and the corresponding English translations, whereas {{there is no such}} preference when perceiving <b>time</b> <b>references</b> without spatial metaphors. Furthermore, this vertical tendency is not {{due to the fact that}} vertical gestures are generally less ambiguous than lateral gestures for addressees. In conclusion, the vertical gesturing about time by Chinese English bilinguals is shaped by both the stable language-specific conceptualisations, and the online changes in linguistic choices...|$|R

25|$|Languages that do {{not have}} {{grammatical}} tense, such as Chinese, express <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> chiefly by lexical means – through adverbials, time phrases, and so on. (The same is done in tensed languages, to supplement or reinforce the time information conveyed by the choice of tense.) Time information is also sometimes conveyed as a secondary feature by markers of other categories, as with the Chinese aspect markers le and guo, which in most cases place an action in past time. However, much time information is conveyed implicitly by context – it is therefore not always necessary, when translating from a tensed to a tenseless language, say, to express explicitly in the target language all of the information conveyed by the tenses in the source.|$|E

If they were left to run indefinitely, though, their timekeeping would drift, so {{they need to be}} synchronized regularly with a network of even more stable ground-based reference clocks. These include active {{hydrogen maser}} clocks and clocks based on the caesium frequency standard, which show a far better medium and long-term stability than rubidium or passive hydrogen maser clocks. These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffhofen Galileo Control Centres.

2500|$|In grammar, tense is a {{category}} that expresses <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> {{with reference to}} the moment of speaking. It is not related to the adjective tense, which comes from Latin tensus, the perfect passive participle of tendere [...] "stretch".|$|E
2500|$|The {{category}} of aspect expresses how {{a state or}} action relates to time – whether {{it is seen as}} a complete event, an ongoing or repeated situation, etc. Many languages make a distinction between perfective aspect (denoting complete events) and imperfective aspect (denoting ongoing or repeated situations); some also have other aspects, such as a perfect aspect, denoting a state following a prior event. Some of the traditional [...] "tenses" [...] express <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> together with aspectual information. In Latin and French, for example, the imperfect denotes past time in combination with imperfective aspect, while other verb forms (the Latin perfect, and the French passé composé or passé simple) are used for past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> with perfective aspect.|$|E

2500|$|The proclamations of Elizabeth II's {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in February 1952 differed between Canada and the United Kingdom; in the latter, the new queen was referred to unconventionally as Queen Elizabeth II by the Grace of God, Queen of this Realm, and of Her other Realms and Territories, while the Canadian Privy Council adhered to {{the letter of the}} law, calling the sovereign Elizabeth the Second by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas. The discrepancies between independent countries sharing one person as sovereign prompted discussions amongst the Commonwealth prime ministers before a meeting in London, England, in December 1952; Canada's then prime minister, Louis St. Laurent, stated that it was important a new composition for the royal title be agreed upon by all realms involved, to [...] "emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries." [...] Canada's preferred format was: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada and of Her other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith; the Canadian government preferred to keep the word [...] "queen" [...] next to [...] "Canada", as it made the sovereign's role as monarch of Canada more clear than having [...] "queen" [...] follow several words on after the country's name. However, as Australian ministers wished to have the United Kingdom mentioned in all the Queen's titles, the resolution reached was a designation that included the United Kingdom as well as, for the first <b>time,</b> <b>reference</b> to Canada and the other Commonwealth realms separately.|$|E
