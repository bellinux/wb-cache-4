We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of the widely studied Perceptron andWinnow algorithms for learning linear <b>threshold</b> <b>functions</b> under Valiant’s probably approximately correct (PAC) model of concept learning. We show that under the uniform distribution on boolean examples, the Perceptron algorithm can efficiently PAC learn nested functions (a class of linear <b>threshold</b> <b>functions</b> known to be hard for Perceptron under arbitrary distributions) but cannot efficiently PAC learn arbitrary linear <b>threshold</b> <b>functions.</b> We also prove that Littlestone’s Winnow algorithm is not an efficient PAC learning algorithm for the class of positive linear <b>threshold</b> <b>functions,</b> thus answering an open question posed by Schmitt [Neural Comput., 10 (1998), pp. 235 – 250].

First, {{there is a}} summary of the necessary conditions to construct the <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> on the basis of previous studies. And a new function for this method is put forward for wavelet packet denoising. Then,through four kinds of previous representative evolutionary <b>thresholding</b> <b>functions</b> are used for contrast, with the addition of traditional soft and hard threshoulding, all these functions are tested in a simulation experiment via four kinds of typical signals contarminated by different Gaussian white noise. Finally,the results show that the new function can be further remove noise effectively, and improve the signal-to-noise ratio, which reflects the superiority of conducting the modified <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> for wavelet packet signal denoising.

It was shown by Hellerstein that this class cannot be characterized by a finite number of such objects. In this paper, we investigate classes of <b>threshold</b> <b>functions</b> which arise as intersections of the class of all <b>threshold</b> <b>functions</b> with clones of Boolean functions, and provide a complete classification of such intersections in respect to whether they have finite characterizations.

L. Donoho and I. M. Johnstone. First continuity and higher derivative of <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> {{can be obtained by}} setting adjustment factors, second the difference between the value of the original signal and the one quantized is unlimitedly decreased, finally, according to the noisy signal features and the distributional difference of noise energy, the effective <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> can be obtained with different adjustment factors. Objective assessment parameters of de-noising image quality are calculated from the experiment of Matlab simulation, which suggests that the impact of de-noising algorithm with the new <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> is better than the traditional soft and hard thresholding de-noising algorithms, furthermore, which lays a good foundation on image enhancement, feature extraction and edge detection.

40|$|In {{multiple}} simultaneous {{hypothesis testing}} (MSHT), a significance <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> as a scalar statistic {{can be designed}} in an adaptive manner by sharing information among many tests performed simultaneously. By using such an adapted statistic, MSHT has greater detection power than tests using simple individual statistics. To systematically obtain an optimal <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> that maximizes the detection power in MSHT, Storey (2007) proposed a theoretical framework called the optimal discovery procedure (ODP). He also proposed an empirical estimation of the ODP <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> for a parametric MSHT that presupposes parametric forms of the null and alternative likelihood functions. Empirical Bayesian testing (Efron et al. 2001), {{which is based on}} a non-parametric treatment of arbitrary test statistics, has sometimes exhibited comparable power to the ODP. These two MSHT frameworks appear to be closely related but, because of differences in their approach (frequentist vs. Bayesian), the relationship is not well understood. We present the new concept of an optimal sufficient statistic that links the ODP and empirical Bayesian frameworks, and we show that the local false discovery rate based on the empirical Bayes can be an optimal <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> if a certain condition holds. We lay out exhaustive sets of presumptions to achieve optimal <b>thresholding</b> <b>functions</b> and show that, if an optimal <b>thresholding</b> <b>function</b> is derived for a parametric MSHT problem, it is still optimal for a more general and broader range of MSHT problems defined in a non- or semi-parametric way. A guide to designing optimal <b>thresholding</b> <b>functions</b> for general MSHT problems is thus provided by our study. ...|$|R

In addition we concentrate on the physically interesting effect that at certain critical points in the orbifold moduli spaces additional massless states appear in the string spectrum leading to logarithmic singularities in the <b>threshold</b> <b>functions.</b> We discuss this effect for the gauge coupling threshold corrections; here the appearance of additional massless states {{is directly related to}} the Higgs effect in string theory.
