40|$|Concerning the {{concrete}} block reefs and the tire reefs {{set at the}} off sea of Makurazaki City, diving observations were carried out; with the following results obtained. (1) The formations of both of the reefs were ascertained to be two hillock shaped, with the similar side figures shown; as to the figures of the central parts it may be said that in case of {{the concrete}} blocks it was of a saddle shape, and in case of the <b>tire</b> <b>blocks,</b> of a concaved dish shape. (2) On and along the concaved parts of the both reefs, dense gatherings of the big shaped migrating as well as stationary fishes were noted; especially, Trachrus japonicus, Parapristipoma trilineatum, Apogon semilineatus and Plectorhynchus pictus were numerous. (3) Almost all the fish schools allured towards the concrete blocks were bigsized ones; while in case of the tire reefs, small sized immature fishes were numerous, {{the reason why the}} sizes of the gathering fishes were full of variety was assumed to be due to the difference in the structural features of the respective reefs; in other words, in the former cases the open spaces are big enough to let the big sized fishes be through and in the latter cases those are too small to let them be through, only letting the small ones be in. 枕崎市沖合に設置されているコンクリートブロック魚礁とタイヤ魚礁について潜水観察を実施した結果,次のような知見を得た。 (1) 両魚礁の形態は,側面形状の酷以した 2 山型であるが,中央部分の形状が,コンクリートブロック魚礁では鞍型,タイヤ魚礁では皿型の凹みをなしている。 (2) 両魚礁のこの凹みの部分には,回遊性,定座性の大型魚および小型魚が密群をつくる。特にイサキ,ネンブツダイ,アジ,コショウダイが多い。 (3) コンクリートブロック魚礁に蝟集している魚群はほとんど成魚が多い。特にイサキ・マダイは顕著である。このように蝟集魚の体型に差があるのは,魚礁の個体の構造が異なるためであろう...|$|E

Results indicate that friction coefficient between tread and ice road increases when the temperature decreases; different tread patterns have a certain influence on the friction coefficient; its average difference was less than 10 %. Different roads impact the coefficient of friction more significantly; the greater the pattern slope, the greater the radial stiffness...|$|R

Twenty Grand won the Wood Memorial Stakes, Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes, Dwyer Stakes, Travers Stakes, Saratoga Cup, and the Jockey Club Gold Cup. In his only blemish of the year, Twenty Grand just missed the Triple Crown, finishing second to Mate in the Preakness. He went off as the post time favorite at 3:2. Mate, his stablemate, was sent to the front early, followed by Clock Tower. As Twenty Grand tried to pass the leaders on the clubhouse turn, he was bumped badly by Clock Tower. Twenty Grand was knocked off his stride but recovered. Down the back stretch and around the final turn, he made up ground on Ladder and Mate. His jockey, Charlie Kurtsinger, chose the rail and went inside, but the <b>tiring</b> Mate <b>blocked</b> Twenty Grand and held on to win by a half length.

50|$|Friction bullet traps {{slow and}} capture the bullet more gently than steel plates. This allows more {{effective}} capture of contaminants {{and reduces the}} production of dust as well as allowing for the capture of higher energy projectiles which would wear an impact trap too quickly and necessitate uneconomical levels of maintenance. The {{most common form of}} friction trap is a berm of granular material such as sand; earth or granulated rubber. In some circumstances a wall of railway ties, intact vehicle <b>tires,</b> or <b>blocks</b> of shock attenuating concrete (SACON) or other proprietary materials may be used. SACON is a fiber-reinforced concrete substituting expanded polystyrene beads for gravel aggregate. For ISSF 50Metre rifle events, individual bullet traps comprising a metal box filled with plastic beads are often used behind the electronic scoring systems used for such events. Such systems require less space than earthen berms whilst being quieter than steel impact or deceleration traps, which can be a significant consideration for urban outdoor range complexes. Individual bullet traps of this nature would typically be backed by a concrete wall to protect from negligent discharges or mechanical failures causing a bullet to miss the target entirely but which is not expected to be struck during the course of normal firing. Intact vehicle tyres are generally only suitable for higher energy projectiles which will easily penetrate their surface. Handgun bullets and shotgun pellets may ricochet back. Granulated rubber (often from shredded tires) is a convenient capture material from which bullets may be separated by gravity during agitation by subsequent bullet impact.|$|R

40|$|As {{the role}} of {{computational}} models has increased, the accuracy of computational results has been of great concern to engineering decision-makers. To address a growing concern about the predictive capability of the computational models, this dissertation proposed a generic model validation framework with four research objectives as: Objective 1 &mdash to develop a hierarchical framework for statistical model validation that is applicable to various computational models of engineered products (or systems); Objective 2 &mdash to advance a model calibration technique that can facilitate to improve predictive capability of computational models in a statistical manner; Objective 3 &mdash to build a validity check engine of a computational model with limited experimental data; and Objective 4 &mdash to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed validation framework with five engineering problems requiring different experimental resources and predictive computational models: (a) cellular phone, (b) <b>tire</b> tread <b>block,</b> (c) thermal challenge problem, (d) constrained-layer damping structure and (e) energy harvesting device. The validation framework consists of three activities: validation planning (top-down), validation execution (bottom-up) and virtual qualification. The validation planning activity requires knowledge about physics-of-failure (PoF) mechanisms and/or system performances of interest. The knowledge facilitates to decompose an engineered system into subsystems and/or components such that PoF mechanisms or system performances of interest can be decomposed accordingly. The validation planning activity takes a top-down approach and identifies vital tests and predictive computational models of which contain both known and unknown model input variable(s). On the other hand, the validation execution activity takes a bottom-up approach, which improves the predictive capability of the computational models from the lowest level to the highest using the statistical calibration technique. This technique compares experimental results with predicted ones from the computational model {{to determine the best}} statistical distributions of unknown random variables while maximizing the likelihood function. As the predictive capability of a computational model at a lower hierarchical level is improved, this enhanced model can be fused into the model at a higher hierarchical level. The validation execution activity is then continued for the model at the higher hierarchical level. After the statistical model calibration, a validity of the calibrated model should be assessed; therefore, a hypothesis test for validity check method was developed to measure and evaluate the degree of mismatch between predicted and observed results while considering the uncertainty caused by limited experimental data. Should the model become valid, the virtual qualification can be executed in a statistical sense for new product developments. With five case studies, this dissertation demonstrates that the validation framework is applicable to diverse classes of engineering problems for improving the predictive capability of the computational models, assessing the fidelity of the computational models, and assisting rational decision making on new design alternatives in the product development process...|$|R
