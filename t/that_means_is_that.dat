50|$|Often Conrad style ball {{bearings}} will exhibit contact ellipse truncation under axial load. What <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> either the ID {{of the outer}} ring is large enough, or the OD of the inner ring is small enough, so as to reduce the area of contact between the balls and raceway. When this is the case, it can significantly increase the stresses in the bearing, often invalidating general rules of thumb regarding relationships between radial and axial load capacity. With construction types other than Conrad, one can further decrease the outer ring ID and increase the inner ring OD to guard against this.|$|E

5000|$|DWP {{figures show}} that, between January and November 2011, 10,600 sick and {{disabled}} people died within {{six weeks of}} their benefit claim ending; many disability campaigners believe that these deaths occurred after — and even because — the claimants were declared fit for work. The Daily Telegraph has questioned this: it posits that the 10,600 deaths include people who happened to die from natural causes, after which their benefit payments ceased. The newspaper said that when the DWP states [...] "within six weeks", this [...] "does not mean 'within the following six weeks': it means 'within six weeks either side'. What <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the large, presumably overwhelming, majority of those 10,600 people died, and then their claims ended because they were dead." ...|$|E

50|$|The Sacrament of Holy Baptism is {{the sacrament}} by {{which one is}} {{initiated}} into the Christian faith. Lutherans teach that at Baptism, they receive God's promise of salvation. At the same time, they receive the faith {{they need to be}} open to God's grace. Lutherans baptize by sprinkling or pouring water on the head of the person (or infant) as the Trinitarian formula is spoken. Lutherans teach baptism to be necessary, but not absolutely necessary, for salvation. What <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> although baptism is indeed necessary for salvation, it is, as Luther said, contempt for the sacraments that condemns, not lack of the sacraments. Therefore, one is not denied salvation merely because one may have never had the opportunity to be baptized. This is what is meant by saying that baptism is necessary—but not absolutely necessary—to salvation.|$|E

In 2010 he made a plea to the legal experts, members of civil society and diplomats who were present at the 2010 Experts' Meeting at the Brookings Institution.

The Geneva Conventions were elaborated in 1949, codifying the laws of war. But crimes against humanity - one of the most revolutionary and important elements of the Nuremberg Charter itself - were never set out in a treaty until the adoption of the International Criminal Court Statute in the summer of 1998. Practically speaking, what <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the words uttered after Nuremberg [...] "And never again" [...] have but a hollow significance.

5000|$|John F. Allen Jr., Vatican {{correspondent}} for the National Catholic Reporter, has commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican’s initial silence on the Boston Globe stories as showing a lack of concern or awareness about the issue. However, Allen said that he doesnt know anyone in the Roman Curia who was not horrified [...] "by the revelations {{that came out of}} the Globe and elsewhere" [...] or that [...] "would defend Cardinal Law’s handling of the cases in Boston" [...] or [...] "would defend the rather shocking lack of oversight that revealed itself although they might have different analyses of what should have happened to him".
