5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems {{had no effect on}} aging.|$|E

5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament {{and the extent to which}} attachment acts as a moderator. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E

5|$|Many predators feed on {{the milk}} shark, {{including}} larger sharks such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni), and possibly also marine mammals. Off KwaZulu-Natal, the decimation of large sharks {{by the use of}} gillnets to protect beaches has led to a recent increase in milk shark numbers. A known parasite of this species is the copepod Pseudopandarus australis. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that male and female milk sharks segregate from each other.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{effects on}} {{fisheries}} are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on aquaculture, although long-lining fisheries {{also have to}} deal with bait stealing. There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and predatory fish (like tuna).|$|E
25|$|Studies of the {{metabolism}} of synephrine by monoamine oxidases {{derived from}} rat brain mitochondria showed that synephrine was a substrate for deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B, with Km = 250 μM and Vmax = 32.6 nM/mg protein/30 minutes; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> for preferential deamination by MAO-A.|$|R
30|$|The laboratory-based X-ray phase {{contrast}} system used here {{was able to}} detect the iron inks {{and the structure of}} the papyrus.

5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity. A French study {{has shown that}} mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> of territoriality, as {{birds in}} the Wheatbelt {{maintain}} territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and Australian hobby. The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.|$|E

5|$|After {{teaching}} as a master of arts in Paris for over forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that Pope Alexander III {{had a hand in}} Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Although modest {{about his}} own {{abilities}} and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was {{fully aware of the}} talents he possessed as a player; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> that he sought to influence his legacy. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews, assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished.
