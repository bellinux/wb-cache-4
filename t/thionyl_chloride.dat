5|$|Like {{many other}} {{hydrated}} metal chlorides, hydrated iron(III) chloride {{can be converted}} to the anhydrous salt by refluxing with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> Conversion of the hydrate to anhydrous iron(III) chloride is not accomplished by heating, as HCl and iron oxychlorides are produced.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonic acids {{react with}} <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> to produce sulfonyl {{chlorides}}. Sulfonyl chlorides {{have also been}} prepared from the direct reaction of the corresponding diazonium salt with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> is {{sometimes}} confused with sulfuryl chloride, SO2Cl2, but {{the properties of}} these compounds differ significantly. Sulfuryl chloride {{is a source of}} chlorine whereas <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> is a source of chloride ions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{can be used}} in {{variations}} of the Pummerer rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{has also}} been used to promote the Beckmann {{rearrangement}} of oximes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{can engage}} {{in a range of}} electrophilic {{addition}} reactions. It adds to alkenes in the presence of AlCl3 to form an aluminium complex which can be hydrolysed to form a sulfinic acid. Both aryl sulfinyl chlorides and diaryl sulfoxides can be prepared from arenes through reaction with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> in triflic acid or the presence of catalysts such as BiCl3, Bi(OTf)3, LiClO4 or NaClO4.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{reacts with}} water to form sulfur dioxide and {{hydrochloric}} acid. This process is highly exothermic.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the above four {{reactions}} also affords phosphorus oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride), which resembles <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> in many of its reactions.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{reactive}} acid derivatives such as acid halides {{are easily}} obtained by mixing with halogenation agents like phosphorus chlorides or <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hydrolysis of boronic esters {{back to the}} boronic {{acid and}} the alcohol can be {{accomplished}} in certain systems with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and pyridine.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{products}} of <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> are themselves highly reactive and as such it {{is involved in a}} wide range of reactions.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, a {{reaction}} between <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and {{an excess of}} anhydrous alcohol {{can be used to}} produce anhydrous alcoholic solutions of HCl.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydroxyl}} group on carboxylic acids may {{be replaced with}} a chlorine atom using <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> to give acyl chlorides. In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to thioesters.|$|E
25|$|HBr {{requires}} refluxing with a {{sulfuric acid}} catalyst. Ethyl halides can, in principle, also {{be produced by}} treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents, such as <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> or phosphorus tribromide.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{a common}} {{catalyst}} used in the synthesis of acyl halides, in particular the synthesis of acyl chlorides from carboxylic acids using oxalyl or <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> The catalytic mechanism entails reversible formation of an imidoyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{is mainly}} {{used in the}} {{industrial}} production of organochlorine compounds, which are often intermediates in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. It usually is preferred over other reagents, such as phosphorus pentachloride, as its by-products (HCl and SO2) are gaseous, which simplifies purification of the product.|$|E
25|$|Benzoic acid is a {{precursor}} to benzoyl chloride, C6H5C(O)Cl by treatment with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> phosgene {{or one of the}} chlorides of phosphorus. Benzoyl chloride is an important starting material for several benzoic acid derivates like benzyl benzoate, which is used in artificial flavours and insect repellents.|$|E
25|$|By an {{analogous}} process primary amides will react with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> to form imidoyl chlorides, with secondary amides also giving chloroiminium ions. These species are highly reactive {{and can be}} used to catalyse the conversion of carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, they are also exploited in the Bischler–Napieralski reaction as a means of forming isoquinolines.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{samples of}} zinc {{chloride}} typically contain water and products from hydrolysis as impurities. Such samples may be purified by recrystallization from hot dioxane. Anhydrous samples can be purified by sublimation {{in a stream}} of hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating the sublimate to 400°C in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Finally, the simplest method relies on treating the zinc chloride with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride.,</b> ZnCl2, CdCl2, ThCl4, CrCl3, FeCl3, CoCl2, and NiCl2 from the corresponding hydrates.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{reduction}} of acid chlorides {{to give the}} corresponding aldehyde product cannot proceed via LAH, since the latter reduces {{all the way to}} the primary alcohol. Instead, the milder lithium aluminium tri(t-butoxy)hydride, which reacts significantly faster with the acid chloride than with the aldehyde, must be used. For example, when isovaleric acid is treated with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> to give isovaleroyl chloride, it can then be reduced via lithium aluminium tri(t-butoxy)hydride to give isovaleraldehyde in 65% yield.|$|E
25|$|Under Friedel–Crafts {{reaction}} conditions, arenes {{react with}} sulfonyl halides and sulfonic acid anhydrides affording sulfones. Commonly used catalysts include AlCl3, FeCl3, GaCl3, BF3, SbCl5, BiCl3 and Bi(OTf)3, among others. Intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization occurs with 2-phenyl-1-ethanesulfonyl chloride, 3-phenyl-1-propanesulfonyl chloride and 4-phenyl-1-butanesulfonyl chloride on heating in nitrobenzene with AlCl3. Sulfenyl and sulfinyl chlorides also undergo Friedel–Crafts–type reactions, affording sulfides and sulfoxides, respectively. Both aryl sulfinyl chlorides and diaryl sulfoxides {{can be prepared}} from arenes through reaction with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{in the presence of}} catalysts such as BiCl3, Bi(OTf)3, LiClO4 or NaClO4.|$|E
25|$|The OH {{group is}} not a good leaving group in {{nucleophilic}} substitution reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH2+, the leaving group (water) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with hydrochloric acid to produce tertiary alkyl halides, where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom by unimolecular nucleophilic substitution. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with hydrochloric acid, an activator such as zinc chloride is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E
25|$|The thus {{produced}} NdCl3 quickly absorbs {{water and}} converts to NdCl3·6H2O hydrate, which is stable for storage, {{and can be}} converted back into NdCl3 when necessary. Simple rapid heating of the hydrate is not practical for that purpose because it causes hydrolysis with consequent production of Nd2O3. Therefore, anhydrous NdCl3 is prepared by dehydration of the hydrate either by slowly heating to 400°C with 4-6 equivalents of ammonium chloride under high vacuum, or by heating with an excess of <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> for several hours. The NdCl3 can alternatively be prepared by reacting neodymium metal with hydrogen chloride or chlorine, though this method is not economical due to the relatively high price of the metal and is used for research purposes only. After preparation, it is usually purified by high temperature sublimation under high vacuum.|$|E
25|$|FDCA is a {{very stable}} compound. Its {{physical}} properties, such as insolubility in most of common solvents and a very high melting point (it melts at 342°C) seem to indicate intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Despite its chemical stability, FDCA undergoes reactions typical for carboxylic acids, such as halogen substitution to give carboxylic dihalides, the di-ester formation {{and the formation of}} amides. All these reactions were elaborated at the end of 19th and in the beginning of 20th century. Newer methods have been described by Janda et al., who introduced the synthesis of 2,5-furandicarboxylic dichloride, by the reaction of FDCA with <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> The synthesis of diethyl ester and dimethyl ester as well as the amidation as well as several other modifications have been reported. The versatility of FDCA is also seen in the number of derivatives available via relatively simple chemical transformations. Selective reduction can lead to partially hydrogenated products, such as 2,5 dihydroxymethylfuran, and fully hydrogenated materials, such as 2,5 bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (Figure 2).|$|E
500|$|Perchlorates and {{perchloric acid}} (HOClO3) {{are the most}} stable oxo-compounds of {{chlorine}}, {{in keeping with the}} fact that chlorine compounds are most stable when the chlorine atom is in its lowest (−1) or highest (+7) possible oxidation states. Perchloric acid and aqueous perchlorates are vigorous and sometimes violent oxidising agents when heated, in stark contrast to their mostly inactive nature at room temperature due to the high activation energies for these reactions for kinetic reasons. Perchlorates are made by electrolytically oxidising sodium chlorate, and perchloric acid is made by reacting anhydrous sodium perchlorate or barium perchlorate with concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtering away the chloride precipitated and distilling the filtrate to concentrate it. Anhydrous perchloric acid is a colourless mobile liquid that is sensitive to shock that explodes on contact with most organic compounds, sets hydrogen iodide and <b>thionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> on fire and even oxidises silver and gold. Although it is a weak ligand, weaker than water, a few compounds involving coordinated [...] are known.|$|E
