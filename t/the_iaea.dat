5|$|In September 1961, Harlan Cleveland, then Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, {{appointed}} Smyth {{to chair}} {{a committee to}} review U.S. policy toward <b>the</b> <b>IAEA.</b> The committee's report affirmed the importance of civilian uses of nuclear energy. In 1962 Cleveland again tapped Smyth, this time {{as an adviser to}} the State Department on <b>the</b> <b>IAEA.</b> In this position Smyth advocated for a transfer of national nuclear safeguards to <b>the</b> <b>IAEA.</b>|$|E

5|$|The accident, {{along with}} other similar events, {{prompted}} <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> to re-evaluate {{the effectiveness of the}} radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head, none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning, nor were there written warnings in Thai. Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from <b>the</b> <b>IAEA,</b> Smyth remained active. On the 40th {{anniversary of the}} Trinity test in 1985, he denounced President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative and called for joint arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union. He died September 11, 1986, in Princeton. The cause was cardiac arrest, though he had long battled cancer.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Amano {{served as}} the {{ambassador}} from Japan to <b>the</b> <b>IAEA.</b> From September 2005 to September 2006, Amano {{served as the}} Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> Board of Governors. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> and its Director General Mohamed ElBaradei received the Nobel Peace Prize.

25|$|The IAEA's Board of Governors convened on 9–12 June and {{condemned}} Israel's action. The Board further {{asked that the}} prospect of suspending Israel's privileges and rights of membership be considered at the next General Conference held by the organization. On 26 September 1981, <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> Conference condemned the attack and voted to suspend all technical assistance to Israel. A draft resolution was introduced to expel Israel from <b>the</b> <b>IAEA,</b> but the proposition was defeated. The United States argued that the attack was not a violation of <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> Statute and that punitive action against Israel would do great harm to <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> and the non-proliferation regime.|$|E
50|$|Both {{views were}} heavily lobbied by {{different}} groups, including the reactor's designers, power plant personnel, and the Soviet and Ukrainian governments. According to <b>the</b> <b>IAEA's</b> 1986 analysis, <b>the</b> {{main cause of}} the accident was the operators' actions. But according to <b>the</b> <b>IAEA's</b> 1993 revised analysis the main cause was the reactor's design. One reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate {{about the causes of}} the Chernobyl accident was that the primary data covering the disaster, as registered by the instruments and sensors, were not completely published in the official sources.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, <b>The</b> <b>IAEA's</b> Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) for 2008, {{concludes that}} earlier issues of {{undeclared}} nuclear activities and material {{reported to the}} Board of Governors in February 2005 are no longer outstanding.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, 2.5 tonnes of waste, {{including}} 13 kg of 80% enriched uranium, {{were transported}} from Vinča to a reprocessing facility at Mayak, Russia. This was <b>the</b> <b>IAEA's</b> largest ever technical cooperation project, {{and thousands of}} police protected the convoys.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>IAEA</b> {{maintains}} a website reporting recent accidents.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{historical}} reasons {{and the political}} nature of its work, <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> is not a specialized agency. Instead, {{its relationship to the}} United Nations is governed by a special agreement as well as by its statute that commits <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> to report annually to the General Assembly and, when appropriate, to the Security Council.|$|E
25|$|In December 1991, the Quadripartite Agreement was {{established}} among Brazil, Argentina, the ABACC and <b>the</b> <b>IAEA.</b> It regulated IAEA inspections in Brazil and Argentina, while recognizing the SCCC and stating {{the need to}} avoid duplication of work between ABACC and <b>the</b> <b>IAEA.</b> The accord came into force in 1994 {{and it has been}} in force since then.|$|E
5000|$|An IAEA {{report issued}} 8 November 2011 {{provided}} detailed information outlining <b>the</b> <b>IAEA's</b> concerns about <b>the</b> possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program, noting that Iran had pursued a structured program or activities {{relevant to the}} development of nuclear weapons.|$|R

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{conflict}} has been Brazil’s refusal {{to sign the}} Additional Protocol (AP), a voluntary legal instrument that complements comprehensive safeguards agreements and provides <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> broader rights of access to sites. Despite the pressures coming from <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> and some nuclear weapon states that consider the AP a fundamental instrument of the verification regime, Brazil has strongly opposed it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>IAEA's</b> {{exclusion}} of data where estimated dose is below a certain threshold (following ICRP recommendations) {{is contrary to}} normal practice, even the ICRP's own practice, and contradicts the linear no-threshold model (LNT).

25|$|North Korea's {{nuclear weapons}} program {{dates back to the}} 1980s. Focusing on {{practical}} uses of nuclear energy and the completion of a nuclear weapon development system, North Korea began to operate facilities for uranium fabrication and conversion, and conducted high-explosive detonation tests. In 1985 North Korea ratified the NPT but did not include the required safeguards agreement with <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> until 1992. In early 1993, while verifying North Korea's initial declaration, <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> concluded that there was strong evidence this declaration was incomplete. When North Korea refused the requested special inspection, <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> reported its noncompliance to the UN Security Council. In 1993, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT, but suspended that withdrawal before it took effect.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>IAEA’s</b> Department of Safeguards has {{embarked}} on an evolutionary process to more fully develop and apply the State-level concept for safeguards implementation. In an attempt to direct safeguards to areas of greatest proliferation risk, this concept makes use of all safeguards-relevant information available in order to focus and prioritize its safeguards activities for a State. A key component {{is the development of}} a State-level Approach which consists of analysing acquisition paths, establishing and prioritizing technical objectives, and identifying applicable safeguards measures. The methodology to accomplish this is based on a three-step-approach: network modeling, network analysis, and strategic assessment. The network modeling step assesses and formalizes the State’s nuclear capabilities as well as other state-specific factors concerning relevant proliferation scenarios. The network analysis step gives a ranking of all plausible acquisition paths including a visualization of the paths. Finally, the strategic assessment evaluates the State’s proliferation and compliance options as well as <b>the</b> <b>IAEA’s</b> set of technical objectives and subsequent safeguards measures. In this paper, a hypothetical State model was developed in order to test the methodology’s performance. Therefore, an Excel spreadsheet with all necessary state-level factors has been created. Afterwards, a Python software module based on graph theoretical algorithms was applied to produce a comprehensive list of ranked acquisition paths including their visualization. The following step of the strategic evaluation is mainly based on the concept of the Nash equilibrium resulting in a stable combination of the State’s and <b>the</b> <b>IAEA’s</b> strategies. This formal and automatic procedure offers the advantage of gaining results in a comprehensive and non-discriminative manner...|$|R
25|$|In April 2011, after {{a lengthy}} {{investigation}} <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> officially confirmed that the site was a nuclear reactor.|$|E
25|$|Regarding <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> report, several {{news reports}} {{suggested}} that Iran {{had failed to}} properly report the amount of low-enriched uranium it possessed because Iranian estimates did not match <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> inspector's findings, and that Iran now had enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The reporting was widely criticized as unjustifiably provocative and hyped. In response to the controversy, IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming asserted that <b>the</b> <b>IAEA</b> had {{no reason at all}} to believe that the estimates of low-enriched uranium produced by Iran were an intentional error, and that no nuclear material could be removed from the facility for further enrichment to make nuclear weapons without the agency's knowledge since the facility is subject to video surveillance and the nuclear material is kept under seal.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} 18 incidences of theft {{or loss of}} highly enriched uranium (HEU) and {{plutonium}} confirmed by <b>the</b> <b>IAEA.</b>|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, <b>the</b> <b>IAEA's</b> 35-nation Board of Governors {{overwhelmingly}} backed {{a demand}} of the U.S., Russia, China, {{and three other}} powers that Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment. Iranian officials shrugged off approval of the resolution by 25 members of the Board, but the U.S. and its allies hinted at new UN sanctions if Iran remained defiant.|$|R
25|$|TEPCO's {{president}} {{maintained that}} {{fears of a}} leak of radioactive material were unfounded (since the amount leaked into the ocean was a billionth of the legal limit), but many international reporters expressed distrust {{of the company that}} has a history of cover-up controversies. <b>The</b> <b>IAEA's</b> Mohamed ElBaradei encouraged full transparency throughout the investigation of the accident so that lessons learned could be applied to nuclear plants elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Egypt shows <b>the</b> <b>IAEA's</b> {{inspectors}} <b>the</b> Radioisotope Production Facility at Inshas, {{which was}} a new facility under construction intended for the separation of radioisotopes from enriched 19.7% U-235 irradiated at the ETRR-2 reactor while Egypt should have reported the decision to construct the new facility no later than 1997. Egypt took a corrective measure, and provided the agency with the facility design information.|$|R
