5|$|A manga series {{based on}} the game started its {{serialization}} in the June 2006 issue of the magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, published by Square Enix. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> Shiro Amano, who also did the Kingdom Hearts and Chain of Memories manga series. The first volume was released in Japan in December 2006. As a result of Amano working in the Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days manga, the series has been on hiatus and resumed publication in October 2012. Tokyopop licensed the manga and released volume one in North America on July 3, 2007. The second volume was released the following year.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E
5|$|The Little Mother is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film stars Marie Eline who goes to her mother's employer and asks for her mother's job after she dies. Her employer is an artist with a kind heart and though the girl does not do the chores well. One of the artists models plot against him makes false charges against him, leading to his arrest. The little girl follows them and learns that they were out to obtain {{a large amount of}} money to have the false case dropped. She reports it to the police and <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> freed, whereby he adopts the girl out of gratitude. Released on February 28, 1911, the film received mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>was</b> {{registered}} in <b>the</b> Guild of Saint Luke until 1622 after {{which there is}} no further record of <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> in <b>the</b> guild records. It <b>is</b> believed that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>was</b> also an art dealer and was thus able to export his own works, which explains their presence in French collections.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1998, most of <b>the</b> <b>artist's</b> {{works have}} <b>been</b> signed [...] "Andy Hope 1930" [...] (although {{at that time}} <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>was</b> still named Andreas Hofer).|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} was first shown in public in 1882, at the Vienna Academy's annual student exhibition, which exhibited works produced during the 1881–82 academic year. It was well received by art critics and Jovanović's peers, who judged {{it to be}} the exhibition's finest work and bestowed him the first-place prize. Jovanović also received an Austro-Hungarian government scholarship. The exact amount accorded to <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> disputed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, writes that the scholarship amounted to 300 florins. Art historians Radmila Antić and Nikola Kusovac state the scholarship amounted to 1,000 florins. Jovanović's triumph at the student exhibition and the subsequent scholarship gave him the means to travel over the summer holidays, during which he came up with a number of ideas for future paintings, such as The Fencing Lesson (Mačevanje). Winning the Vienna Academy prize established him as a respected painter of Orientalist works and set the stage for further recognition and success. In 1883, Jovanović entered into a contract with Ernest Gambart's French Gallery in London to produce a series of paintings on Balkan life. This contract assured him lifelong financial security.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{distinguished}} by its art style, which emulates manga and anime. According to Baba, the character designs are created once the main character's story, personality, and environment {{are determined by}} the rest of the production team. Beyond that, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> allowed to use their imagination, though they can be asked to alter things like costume details, and facial expressions. One of the main designers for the series is manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima. He was first brought in to design the characters for Phantasia, and has since designed for multiple entries including Abyss and Xillia. Another designer, Mutsumi Inomata, first designed for the series with Destiny, and has contributed designs for multiple entries including Eternia, Rebirth and Xillia. A third regular artist is Daigo Okumura, who designed characters for Vesperia and Xillia 2, as well as Dawn of the New World. Other designers to work on the series include Kazuto Nakazawa (Legendia), Kouichi Kimura (Xillia 2), and Minoru Iwamoto (Zestiria). The art design for each game's world and characters has ranged between a cel-shaded anime style (Vesperia) to a more realistic style (Xillia 2). Skit character images are also directly inspired by anime art. The art style for each title is determined by the theme and story decided upon by the developers.|$|E

25|$|The Wassmann Foundation in Washington, D.C., {{launched}} the fictitious artist Johann Dieter Wassmann (1841–1898) {{in the exhibition}} Bleeding Napoleon at the Melbourne International Arts Festival (2003), Melbourne, Australia. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> billed as a pioneer of German Modernism, but his work bears a sly resemblance to Cornell's.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{position}} (through translation and/or rotation), though {{based on the}} inspiration of <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> <b>is</b> no longer attributed to the anecdotal.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> a {{not great}} creator—Duchamp went {{shopping}} at a plumbing store. The artwork {{is not a}} special object—it was mass-produced in a factory. The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling—at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one {{with a sense of}} distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on.|$|E
