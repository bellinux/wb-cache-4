After {{entering}} his home, they discover that he has hanged himself in a fit of autoerotic asphyxiation. Attempting to save his life, they take him to the hospital, where they discover that he is in a coma. Peter invites Quagmire's sister, Brenda, to visit him at the hospital, and she manages to wake up her brother.

5|$|Back at home, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their {{grandfather}} into letting them throw their own party. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing,</b> but Marge wakes up first. Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge {{turning into a}} catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and {{the house is a}} total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house for him.|$|E
5|$|Maurice Richard, {{inducted}} in 1961, and Jean Beliveau, inducted in 1972, {{are two of}} ten {{players for}} whom the selection committee has waived the otherwise-mandatory three-year waiting period before being eligible for induction. Defenceman Doug Harvey was unanimously elected in 1973, one year after being denied entry due to his drinking habits. Angered by the snub, Harvey refused his induction, stating that he planned <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> instead of attending the induction ceremony. Guy Lafleur {{was one of three}} players in NHL history (along with Gordie Howe and Mario Lemieux) to return to playing after being elected. Lafleur, who had first retired in 1984 after growing frustrated with the Canadiens' defence-focused system, returned to the league days after his 1988 election, playing for the New York Rangers and Quebec Nordiques before finally retiring in 1991.|$|E

5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E

25|$|Petro Kalnyshevsky {{was given}} {{two hours to}} decide on the Empress's ultimatum. Under the {{guidance}} of a starshyna Lyakh, behind Kalnyshevky's back a conspiracy was formed with a group of 50 Cossacks <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> in the river Inhul next to the Southern Bug in Ottoman provinces. The pretext was enough to allow the Russians to let the Cossacks out of the siege, who were joined by five thousand others. The fleeing Cossacks traveled to the Danube Delta where they formed the new Danubian Sich, under the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|A nurse {{working at}} the {{hospital}} in the later years of its operation describes the situation much less critically than Frame, noting that while many patients at Seacliff during her time (1940s) {{would not have been}} confined in modern days, the atmosphere was more like that of a large working community. Patients capable of working were asked to help with various duties, partly because of staff shortages in World War II. Unless considered dangerous, patients were allowed some liberties, such as being allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> - an activity that provided patients with leisure time, while also helping the fishing business Truby King had long ago established at nearby Karitane.|$|E
25|$|Some of the Cossack officer class, the starshyna, became {{hereditary}} Russian nobility {{and obtained}} huge lands {{in spite of}} their previous attempts to relocate the Sich to either North America or Australia. Under the guidance of a starshyna named Lyakh, a conspiracy was formed among a group of 50 Cossacks to pretend <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> on the river Inhul next to the Southern Buh in the Ottoman provinces, and to obtain 50 passports for the expedition. The pretext was enough to allow about 5000 Zaporozhians to flee, some travelling to the Danube Delta where they formed a new Danube Sich, as a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire. Others moved to Hungary to form a Sich there as a protectorate of Austrian Empire. According to folklore, some moved to Malta, because Kosh members considered themselves a kind of Maltese chivalry.|$|E

They began {{to work on a}} film based on their own {{experiences}} and their friends in the Chicago lesbian community, which they originally titled [...] "Ely and Max," [...] but was changed <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Fish.</b> By 1993 Troche and Turner ended their relationship and Troche moved to New York where she wrote several scripts. Rose Troche says mixing business and romance on a lesbian film set can be a recipe for disaster. Turner and Troche detail how their breakup during the middle of <b>Go</b> <b>Fish's</b> production was not only difficult for them personally but also trying for their cast and crew, who felt compromised by the fighting couple's palpable tension on the set. Troche lived in London from (1997-1999) until she returned to United States to direct The Safety of Objects (2001).|$|R

Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E

[...] "Holy Dance" [...] was recorded in June 2010, inspired by Yamaguchi's frustrations of unable <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E

500|$|It was {{the absence}} of Symonds, sent home from the 2008–09 series against Bangladesh for {{skipping}} a team meeting <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>fishing,</b> that gave White another opportunity in the ODI team. Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it was nice {{to get a few}} wickets {{but it would have been}} nice to get a few overs under the belt as well."
