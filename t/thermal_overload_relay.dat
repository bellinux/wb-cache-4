50|$|A {{second type}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> <b>relay</b> uses a {{eutectic}} alloy, like a solder, to retain a spring-loaded contact. When too much current passes through the heating element for too long a time, the alloy melts and the spring releases the contact, opening the control circuit and shutting down the motor. Since eutectic alloy elements are not adjustable, they are resistant to casual tampering but require changing the heater coil element to match the motor rated current.|$|E
50|$|A starter {{will contain}} {{protective}} devices for the motor. At a minimum this {{would include a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> <b>relay.</b> The thermal overload is designed to open the starting circuit and thus cut the power to the motor {{in the event of}} the motor drawing too much current from the supply for an extended time. The overload relay has a normally closed contact which opens due to heat generated by excessive current flowing through the circuit. Thermal overloads have a small heating device that increases in temperature as the motor running current increases.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> <b>relay.</b> In one type, a {{bi-metallic}} strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>overload</b> <b>relays</b> are {{economic}} electromechanical {{protection devices}} which offers reliable protection for electric motors {{in the event}} of overload or phase failure. Presently {{there are two types of}} <b>overload</b> <b>relays</b> which depend on the temperature characteristics of metals to provide protection by tripping the circuit. These relays lack accuracy as they do not activate the trip circuit at any exact specified temperature. In this paper we introduce a new form of thermal over-load relay actuated by ferrofluid. The ferrofluid has a very accurate transition temperature known as curie temperature. It acts as a ferromagnetic material below the curie temperature and loses the property of ferromagnetism above this temperature. By using this property of the fluid we propose an alternative method for more accurate operation under <b>overload</b> condition. This <b>relay</b> finds application in the protection system of electrical machines. Thus, in this paper we present a novel and simple technique for protection against <b>thermal</b> <b>overloading</b> using ferrofluid...|$|R
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or <b>thermal</b> <b>overloading.</b> These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> <b>relays.</b> Bi-metal <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R

50|$|A {{magnetic}} starter has a contactor and an <b>overload</b> <b>relay,</b> {{which will}} open the control voltage to the starter coil if it detects an overload on a motor.Overload relays may rely on heat produced by the motor current to operate a bimetal contact or release a contact held closed by a low-melting-point alloy. The <b>overload</b> <b>relay</b> opens a set of contacts that are wired in series with the supply to the contactor feeding the motor. The characteristics of the heaters can be matched to the motor so that the motor is protected against overload.

40|$|This paper proposes two {{approaches}} for a unified management of congestions due to voltage instability and <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> in a deregulated environment. Both techniques aim to remove, in some optimal manner, voltage and thermal congestions stemming from base case or post-contingency states, by a simultaneous handling of operating and security constraints {{with respect to}} several contingencies. The objective of the first approach is to adjust the market-based power injections (generator output and possibly load consumption) at the least cost while the second one aims at curtailing power transactions in a transparent and non-discriminatory way. These techniques rely on sensitivities which pinpoint the best remedial actions against congestions owing to voltage instability and <b>thermal</b> <b>overload.</b> Numerical results with both approaches are provided on a realistic 80 -bus system model.

30|$|For example, a <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> can be {{relieved}} by local protection and through this the asset is protected. However, this local protection cannot assess {{the severity of}} the overload relative to the importance of the asset to system security. Removing this asset immediately may initiate a cascade of <b>thermal</b> <b>overloads.</b> In contrast, by using wide area measurements to develop an accurate view of the system state and the evolving threat to security, a wide area protection scheme could identify the importance of the asset to system security and exploit short term thermal ratings (possibly complemented with dynamic thermal line ratings [24]) to delay the local protection action and provide more time to relieve the overload by alternative means and preserve system security. Thus, wide area protection can be used to realize protection actions that adapt to the system’s needs, in terms of security, and protect against wide area disturbances and cascading failures.|$|R
40|$|Part 7 : Energy: ManagementInternational audienceThe {{low voltage}} (LV) {{distribution}} cable networks were installed some decades ago {{but the new}} paradigm in electric power engineering generates new requirements from these old assets. The distributed generation, storage and new appliances can cause high variation of load and reverse power flow, nevertheless the LV cable grid was not designed to these new stresses.
