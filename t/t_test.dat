25|$|There {{is great}} {{flexibility}} {{in the choice of}} statistical test (and thus the questions that an experiment can be designed to answer), and common choices include the Student's <b>t</b> <b>test</b> or linear regression. An important consideration with SPM, however, is that the large number of comparisons requires one to control the false positive rate with a more stringent significance threshold. This can be done either by modifying the initial statistical test to decrease the α value so as to make it harder for a particular voxel to exhibit a significant difference, or by modifying the clustering analysis in the second step by only considering a brain region's activation to be significant if it contains a certain number of voxels that exhibit a statistical difference.|$|E
