5|$|This match {{marked the}} end of the feud between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant that had {{dominated}} WWF programming for over 18 months though <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> face off several more times In single matches that October. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> face off for the last time 6 months later, just weeks prior to Wrestlemania VI when the then-WWF World Tag Team Champions The Colossal Connection Andre and Haku faced then-WWF World Champion Hulk Hogan and the Big Boss man at a house show. In the weeks after the match, André feuded with other upper-card wrestlers such as Savage and Jake Roberts. Hogan and Savage continued to feud with DiBiase {{for the remainder of the}} year before moving on to a new feud with the Twin Towers (Big Boss Man and Akeem).|$|E

He was a letterman {{on the football team}} in 1927 and 1928; he also played second base on the baseball team in 1928 and 1929, and was a letterman in that sport in 1929. He was later inducted into the university's Athletic Hall of Fame.

On April 24, 1930, he married Helen Dwyer; the couple had three children.|$|E
50|$|Of these three, {{the third}} one is seen {{to be the most}} {{probable}} since <b>the</b> other <b>two</b> <b>would</b> imply that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> forces <b>would</b> both have to travel north to meet each other, which would be impractical.|$|R
5000|$|... the {{citizens}} of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> nations <b>would</b> be allowed to freely trade and travel between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> states and <b>would</b> be guaranteed safe passage while in the other nation ...|$|R

5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{when she}} was {{finishing}} writing up her thesis, she was the youngest and last of Mulliken's pre-war students, and was working alone because all her fellow students had become involved with war work. She met Herbert Anderson, who was working for Enrico Fermi. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> go swimming together in Lake Michigan every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research, {{and as soon as}} her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the boron trifluoride detectors used to measure neutron flux.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{returned}} to the studio and made Hard to Handle in 1933. This {{was followed by a}} steady stream of films, including the highly regarded Footlight Parade, which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots. The film includes show-stopping scenes with Busby Berkeley-choreographed routines. His next notable film was 1934's Here Comes the Navy, which paired him with Pat O'Brien for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> have an enduring friendship.|$|E

5|$|Einstein's {{affiliation}} with the Institute for Advanced Study would last {{until his death in}} 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> have been related by blood, and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} for the only time to western Canada, traveling {{from town to town}} by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, and to get a better view, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> sometimes sit in front of the locomotive on the train's cowcatcher. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E

TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced on the November 1 episode of Impact! that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> face in a bout at Genesis.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese manga and anime {{have also}} adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow {{is known for}} {{creating}} the space western Trigun. The story's protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino's Journey, who both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Georgetown's Floyd and North Carolina's Worthy also drew some {{attention from the}} media. The two players grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina together, where {{they went to the}} same church and competed in high school against each other. Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three miles away from Floyd's. It was noted that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> likely not interact much while playing as they did not play the same position.|$|E
50|$|It has {{the second}} oldest genus of the Echiniscoidea order known as Echiniscoids named by Platte in 1888. Later, the genus Anisonyches were {{described}} in 1975. <b>The</b> first <b>two</b> <b>would</b> {{be placed in}} the new family named Echiniscoididae. There were no subfamilies until 2016 when Møbjerg, Kristensen and Jørgensen described Isoechoniscoides and placed it in the subfamily Isoechiniscoidinae in 2016 <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> <b>would</b> {{be placed in the}} new Echiniscoidinae subfamily.|$|R

5000|$|In the up direction, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> {{sections}} <b>would</b> run independently {{as far as}} Wolverhampton, {{with the}} Pwllheli section using the Abbey Foregate triangle to omit the stop at Shrewsbury. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> sections <b>would</b> then be combined at Wolverhampton. The motive power for each of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sections was usually a [...] "Manor" [...] class 4-6-0 or [...] "Dukedog" [...] 4-4-0, the latter of which were often double-headed.|$|R
5|$|Alonso {{was born}} {{in the small town of}} Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, Periko Alonso, won La Liga twice in {{successive}} seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he joined Barcelona. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career. Xabi Alonso lived in the city of Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián (Donostia) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha (Shell Beach). On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, Mikel Arteta, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability. He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, Mikel, to CE Sabadell's training ground to practice together. Alonso was influenced by his father's playing, taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal. At an early age, he decided to play as a defensive midfielder, a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball well. This talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career.|$|E
5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Chris Lu {{was born}} on June 12, 1966 in New Jersey. In 1974, {{his family moved to}} the Fallsmead {{neighborhood}} of Rockville, Maryland, where he graduated from Thomas S.

Lu said he was heavily influenced by his father, who worked as an electrical engineer but loved literature and history; <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>would</b> read biographies of politicians and watch the evening news together.|$|E
