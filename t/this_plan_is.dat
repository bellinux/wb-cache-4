5|$|In The Book of D'ni, Atrus {{opens the}} crumbled exit {{of the room}} in K'veer, {{where he had been}} imprisoned by Gehn, and gains access to the rest of D'ni. Atrus and his team set out to find linking books and search for D'ni survivors. Eventually, Atrus {{and the rest of the}} D'ni plan on {{rebuilding}} the civilization, but <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> put to a halt when a book leading to a great lost Age called Terahnee is found. Terahnee is a sister Age to D'ni and is populated by descendants of the same ancestors as the D'ni.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> viable only {{if certain}} {{conditions}} are met. The d7-square must {{be available for}} the Ne5, {{so that it can}} later transfer to f6. White should also not be able to easily advance the e3-pawn to e4, where it would be adequately defended by the Nc3 and a possible Bf3. Finally, White should not have the time to launch a quick attack on Black's castled position with the pawn thrust f4–f5–f6.|$|E
5|$|A northwestern {{expansion}} of the City Circle Line was planned, where M4 would divert at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe. This project was abandoned, as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped {{as part of the}} City of Copenhagen's 2009 budget. In subsequent plans, the northern extension of the M4 has instead been relocated as a Nordhavn branch which will connect with the City Circle Line at Østerport. A Nordhavn line with two stations has been approved by the Danish parliament, and is planned to open in 2019. The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg, where the M4 will link up with the S-train and regional train system. The Danish Transport Authority (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested to convert the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line, but as the only linkup between the M5 and the existing network would be at Flintholm Station (interchange with M1 and M2), <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> dependent on the approval of a southern extension of the M4, also providing the M5 with an interchange with the M4 at Ny Ellebjerg Station.|$|E

25|$|The Wayne County Airport Authority's latest FAA Master Plan {{includes}} {{a number of}} proposed future developments to be considered at such time as demand warrants and funding is available. A significant element of <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> growing air service nearly 60 percent until 2030. The goals are to include better connectivity to the Middle-East, India, and nonstop flights to several key destinations in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. This addition would add to the airport's four existing parallel runways and its two crosswind runways in order to alleviate future congestion.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} the current two-runway system, {{there will be}} enhancements to the terminal and apron facilities to increase the airport's capacity. This option will enable the airport to handle a maximum of 420,000 flight movements per year, with annual passenger and cargo throughput increased to 74 million and six million tonnes respectively. The approximate cost of <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> $23.4 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2010 prices, or HK$42.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices. However, the Airport Authority estimates that the airport will reach its maximum runway capacity sometime around 2020 if no extra runway is added.|$|E
25|$|The Christian Teutonic Order {{had been}} waging an ongoing {{war against the}} Prussians during the 13th century; in order to entrench their gains, the Teutons built a number of castles in the area. One such castle was planned for a {{location}} between the Nemunas and Dangė rivers. A written account of <b>this</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> dated to 1252, when a Grand Master of the Teutons, represented by Eberhard von Seyne, made {{an agreement with the}} Curonian bishop to build this fortification. In the same year the Christians constructed the castle and named it Memelburg. The new castle was wooden, protected by a tower, and was in a marshy area. It is likely that this first castle was located on the left bank of the Danė river. It soon became a prime outpost in the war between the Christian Orders and the pagan Lithuanians allied with the Samogitians.|$|E

25|$|Iarnród Éireann's {{plans are}} also on the {{pipeline}} to greatly expand the DART suburban railway network by boring a tunnel through Dublin City Centre allowing the creation of two separate DART lines. Each will run from the North-West & South-West of the city, through the city centre and then extend south and north respectively. <b>This</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> made possible with the DART Underground rail project, boring a tunnel under the city centre that will join Heuston Station with Pearse Station and a relocated Docklands station, via St Stephen's Green. The railway lines from Heuston towards Kildare (Hazelhatch) and from the city centre to Maynooth will be electrified, and the old line to Navan reopened and electrified. This will allow the creation of two separate but inter-connecting DART lines: one running from the north west (Dunboyne/Maynooth) through the city-centre to the southeast (Bray/Greystones); and one running from south-west (Hazelhatch) through the city centre to the northeast (Howth/Balbriggan).|$|E
25|$|In Dune, the Bene Gesserit {{breeding}} scheme is, in theory, to {{have come}} to full fruition from the union of an Atreides daughter (planned to be born of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the Duke Leto Atreides) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, nephew of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (himself secretly the natural father of the Lady Jessica). <b>This</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> disrupted when Jessica chooses to conceive an Atreides son rather than the daughter she had been ordered to produce. This son, Paul Atreides, later proves to be the Kwisatz Haderach, born a generation early. Political intrigue results in Paul's rise to power as Emperor of the Known Universe, secured by his stranglehold on the melange supply. A decade later, in Dune Messiah, the Bene Gesserit are frustrated {{to be at the}} mercy of their own creation, but a conspiracy to remove Paul from power fails. He realizes, however, that while prescience grants knowledge, absolute control of outcomes is not possible due to interference patterns caused by their own actions. Despising the religion that has risen up around him and seeing where it will lead, Paul walks into the desert seeking death in hopes that he can change the course of the future. Paul's son Leto II is also a Kwisatz Haderach; seeing the same future, Leto decides to do what his father could not. He takes control of both the empire and the Bene Gesserit breeding program in Children of Dune, and begins his own transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid to give himself the time he needs for his Golden Path to be fully realized. Thirty-five hundred years later, his breeding plan produces Siona Atreides, the first in a line of humans who are able to disappear from prescient sight, and Leto allows himself to be assassinated. After 1,500 more years (as chronicled in Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune), the Bene Gesserit have restored their breeding program. However, they are too terrified of the consequences of producing another Kwisatz Haderach, so instead breed for special individuals of great talent and usefulness in order to amplify certain human characteristics and preserve them. Now aware of Leto's Golden Path, the Bene Gesserit widen their goals of advancing humanity and saving it from extinction.|$|E
