When work finally resumed on the novel, the title changed from How Ruthie Ended the War to Wildwood, the character of Ruthie became Prue, and the object of her quest changed from her lost father to her kidnapped brother. The early version of the story was, according to Meloy, [...] "wildly inappropriate for children." [...] Once they resumed work on the novel, Ellis said it took about two years to complete. Meloy feared his entry into fiction writing would be seen as [...] "dabbling"; he wanted to avoid creating a [...] "vanity project" [...] like Madonna's picture books.|$|E
