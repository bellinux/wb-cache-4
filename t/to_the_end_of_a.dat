5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stick, pipe, or other straight object {{in order to reach}} higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E
5|$|Root {{extensions}} are additions {{of one or}} two sounds, often plosives, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> root.

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target {{by the shoulders and}} repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This {{would be used to}} snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|NY11A begins west of {{the village}} of Tully at an {{intersection}} with NY80 near its exit with Interstate81 (I-81) in the hamlet of Tully Center. Here, the route also connects to Lake Road (unsigned County Route134 or CR134), a local highway leading south to on-ramps for I-81 southbound and a chain of waterbodies known as the Tully Lakes. NY11A proceeds northward from NY80 as a two-lane unnamed road, connecting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ramp from I-81 southbound before curving northwestward into a rural area of the town. The highway runs through alternating stretches of open, lightly developed terrain and undeveloped woodlands, meeting Solvay Road (CR238) as it descends into Tully Valley, a wide gully surrounding Onondaga Creek. The route heads north along {{the eastern edge of}} the isolated valley, following the creek into the adjacent town of LaFayette.|$|E

5|$|Special springs can {{be found}} {{near the top of}} certain acts. By jumping onto these springs, the player can reach a special stage, where they are sent falling down a tube on a {{snowboard}} while trying to collect enough rings to meet the target amount. By completing the stage, the player receives a Chaos Emerald. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds unlocks the game's true ending. The game also features a minigame called the Tiny Chao Garden, in which players can raise Chao. Players can transfer their Chao between the Tiny Chao Garden and the Chao Garden from the GameCube versions of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode, where up to four owners of the game can race <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> level or search for Chao.|$|E
5|$|The Knicks' success due to Lin's play {{reportedly}} contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{dispute that}} had for 48 days prevented Time Warner Cable customers from watching Knicks games and other MSG Network programs. The market capitalization of the Madison Square Garden Company, the team's owner, rose by $250 million in February and $600 million by July 2012. The Knicks quickly began selling replicas of Lin's No. 17 jerseys and T-shirts, and the sales and traffic for its online store {{increased more than}} 3,000%; Lin's merchandise dominated the displays at Knicks stores, while those for the team's high-priced stars—Anthony, Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler—were moved to the sale racks. He had the best selling jersey in the NBA in February and March. For the one-year period ending April 2012, Lin had the second highest selling jersey in the league behind Derrick Rose. Both Nike and Adidas introduced Lin-related athletic apparel, and expected that his fame would help sales in China. His popularity was attributed with growing the NBA's popularity there since Yao Ming's retirement in the offseason; the audience for NBA games on television and online in China rose 39percent over the previous season.|$|E
5|$|The NHL also {{announced}} that several rule changes were {{in effect for}} this game, to nullify advantages to either team due to the weather conditions. The teams switched ends halfway through the third period. Play was interrupted exactly at the 10:00 minute mark, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> period with a horn sounding, a Zamboni resurfacing the ice, and a faceoff following at center ice. The overtime period was similarly divided into two 2:30 segments.

However, in verse, poetic {{inversion}} {{for the sake of}} meter or of bringing a rhyme word <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line often results in abnormal syntax, as with Shakespeare's split infinitive (to pitied be, cited above), in fact an inverted passive construction in which the infinitive is split by a past participle.

25|$|Early rockets {{were very}} inaccurate. Without {{the use of}} {{spinning}} or any controlling feedback loop, rockets had a strong tendency to veer sharply off of their intended course. The early Mysorean rockets and their successor British Congreve rockets reduced this somewhat by attaching a long stick <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rocket (similar to modern bottle rockets) {{to make it harder}} for the rocket to change course. The largest of the Congreve rockets was the 32-pound (14.5kg) Carcass, which had a 15-foot (4.6 m) stick. Originally, sticks were mounted on the side, but this was later changed to mounting {{in the center of the}} rocket, reducing drag and enabling the rocket to be more accurately fired from a segment of pipe.|$|E
25|$|A pencil eraser is {{an article}} of {{stationery}} attached to {{the opposite end of}} a graphite pencil's sharpened tip. The eraser itself is typically made out of gum-like or synthetic rubber that is used for rubbing out pencil mistakes on paper. On April 15, 1770, English inventor Joseph Priestley described a vegetable gum to remove pencil marks. On March 30, 1858, Hymen Lipman received the first patent for the conception and the idea of attaching an eraser <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pencil. In 1862 Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for $100,000, who went to sue the pencil manufacturer Faber-Castell for infringement. In 1875, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic process}} of protein {{production}} is addition of one amino acid {{at a time}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein. This operation is performed by a ribosome. A ribosome {{is made up of}} two subunits, a small subunit and a large subunit. these subunits come together before translation of mRNA into a protein to provide a location for translation to be carried out and a polypeptide to be produced. The choice of amino acid type to add is determined by an mRNA molecule. Each amino acid added is matched to a three nucleotide subsequence of the mRNA. For each such triplet possible, the corresponding amino acid is accepted. The successive amino acids added to the chain are matched to successive nucleotide triplets in the mRNA. In this way the sequence of nucleotides in the template mRNA chain determines the sequence of amino acids in the generated amino acid chain.|$|E
