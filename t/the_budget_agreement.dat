40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the redistributive effects of <b>the</b> EU <b>budget</b> during <b>the</b> period 1986 - 98, explores {{the implications of}} <b>the</b> Berlin <b>budget</b> <b>agreement</b> and advances a proposal for setting member countries' budgetary balances {{in a manner consistent}} with a simple equity criterion based on relative income per capita. Using an extension of a standard methodology, we find that the redistributive impact of <b>the</b> EU <b>budget</b> has been considerable in view of its small size, that it has tended to increase over time, and that it is mostly due to the effects of structural programmes. We also find that, in spite of the relative loss of weight of structural transfers, the expenditure side of <b>the</b> Berlin <b>budget</b> <b>agreement</b> represents a noticeable (but small) improvement over the previous financial perspectives in terms of both its redistributive impact and its horizontal equity properties. Our proposed allocation criterion involves the correction of horizontal inequities while preserving the current degree of redistribution.

50|$|In February 1980, a standby {{macroeconomic}} policy {{agreement with the}} IMF was signed, but not implemented. The standby agreements of July 1981 and July 1982 were completed in July 1982 and January 1984, respectively. To meet IMF standards, the government terminated its policy of acting as the last-resort employer of all secondary school graduates and abolished its monopoly on grain marketing. The government then prepared a medium-term recovery program consisting of a public investment program for 1984-86 and a phased program of policy reforms. Because the International Development Association (IDA) considered this program too ambitious, the government scaled down its projects, most notably {{the construction of the}} Baardheere Dam, which AID had advised against. The government abandoned its first reform program in 1984. In March 1984, the government signed a letter of intent accepting the terms of a new US$183 million IMF extended credit facility to run for three years.

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{financing}} mechanisms for graduate medical education (GME) in the United States. In so doing, we identify Medicare as the single largest contributor to GME {{and the most important}} barrier to producing a physician workforce that is appropriately sized, balanced, and skilled. Until passage of <b>the</b> 1997 <b>Budget</b> Reconciliation <b>Agreement,</b> <b>the</b> structure of Medicare payments promoted overproduction and skewed production toward training specialists in tertiary settings. We then examine the various reform proposals put forward by major health care organizations and policy bodies. These organizations generally agree on seven policy objectives: Remove incentives that promote expanded resident production; Base the GME subsidy on actual costs and distribute it more uniformly; Focus reductions on specialty residency positions; Provide GME payments for training provided in ambulatory, community, and managed care sites; Decouple Medicare GME reimbursement from payments to health maintenance organizations for patient care; Require all health insurers to contribute to GME; and Ensure that reductions in the GME subsidy do not reduce access to care for low-income persons. A myriad of different mechanisms for achieving these objectives have been recommended, many of which could be melded together to form a comprehensive approach to GME reform. The prospects for meaningful GME reform are dim in the absence of broader Medicare reform. The costs to stake-holders are too concentrated while the benefits to the public are too diffuse for GME reform to stand alone. But the political imperative to deal with <b>the</b> federal <b>budget's</b> short-term deficit and Medicare's long-term solvency will likely create an opportunity for GME reform. An addendum has been added that shows how <b>the</b> 1997 <b>Budget</b> Reconciliation <b>Agreement</b> addresses most of the major reform objectives identified but that several important issues remain unresolved...|$|R
