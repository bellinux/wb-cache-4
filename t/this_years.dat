500|$|To keep intruders at bay, the Committee {{arranged}} a lease of the seabed where the wreck lay from the Portsmouth authorities, thereby discouraging anyone from trespassing on the underwater property.

500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive.

No-one, of course, will ever hear from any of the prize-winners. They all seem to have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E
