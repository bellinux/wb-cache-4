5|$|Although officially located {{slightly}} {{outside the}} town's boundaries in Walsall Wood, Shire Oak School (the former Shire Oak Grammar School) <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> pupils from Brownhills.

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} is omnivorous. It digs beetle larvae {{from trees}} and also <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> other invertebrates including adult beetles, ants and spiders. Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for suet and domestic scraps. The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary. House martin colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> years to mature.|$|E

5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with large}} teeth {{and a strong}} bite, the kitefin shark is a powerful, solitary {{predator}} that <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> different types of prey, ranging from bony fishes, sharks and rays, to cephalopods, crustaceans, polychaete worms, siphonophores, and possibly carrion. It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself, similar to its smaller relative, the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 1014 young. The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat, skin, and liver oil, primarily by Portugal and Japan. A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s, but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock is often cited {{as an example of}} the susceptibility of deep-sea sharks to human exploitation. The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to overfishing and, coupled with known population declines, has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

25|$|Cecily Bonville is {{the protagonist}} in The Summer Queen, a {{historical}} romance {{which was written}} by Alice Walworth Graham and published in 1973. The novel is highly fictitious as it <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> liberties with the known facts of Cecily's life, {{so it is not}} to be regarded as a biography.|$|E

Walther is confused by the complicated rules, but is determined to try for a place in the guild anyway.|$|E

Moorland and chalk downland is easily damaged by regular use, and <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> years to recover. Moorland birds in particular nest and roost on the ground and are therefore especially sensitive. Orienteering, mountain biking and hang gliding are typical activities which are likely to cause disturbance to nesting birds.|$|E

Among the issues have been {{the extent to which}} Modern Orthodoxy should cooperate with the more liberal denominations, support secular academic pursuits combined with religious learning, and embrace efforts to give women a larger role in Jewish learning and worship; the acceptability of modern textual criticism as a tool for Torah study is also debated.|$|E

Popular motivations of youth {{activism in}} Indonesia are indigenous rights and national unity, pro-communism, anticommunism, pro-democracy and militant Islam. A common form of activism is massa, a cavalcade of motorcycles, trucks, music, and many young people on foot. These cavalcades are mostly males and end with a rally to address a certain political issue. In general, youth {{have been looking for}} political change during the last four decades.|$|E

25|$|Singing and {{percussion}} are {{the most}} important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical vocables (nonsense syllables). Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle tremolos, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for singers and dancers.|$|E
25|$|Java was {{the site}} of many {{influential}} kingdoms in the Southeast Asian region, and as a result, many literary works have been written by Javanese authors. These include Ken Arok and Ken Dedes, the story of the orphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese kingdom; and translations of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Pramoedya Ananta Toer is a famous contemporary Indonesian author, who has written many stories based on his own experiences of having grown up in Java, and <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> elements from Javanese folklore and historical legends.|$|E
25|$|Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, {{a form of}} {{artificial}} ventilation, is the act of assisting or stimulating respiration, a metabolic process referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body, where a rescuer presses his or her mouth against that of the victim and blows air into the person's lungs. Assistance <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> forms, but generally entails providing air for {{a person who is}} not breathing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on his/her own. It is used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to achieve the internal respiration).|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{instead of}} a {{hardware}} multiplier, a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in read-only memory (ROM), and compute trigonometric functions with the CORDIC algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. Bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity, but <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> more clock cycles. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the Z80, MC68000, and ARM architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.|$|E
25|$|The town's last {{remaining}} independent preparatory school, Sunnymede School, {{which was in}} Westcliffe Road, Birkdale closed in 2010 {{due to a lack}} of pupils. In the past the town had more independent schools which included Tower Dene, which was situated on Cambridge Road. This school closed in 2002 due to a similar fate. One of the Victorian houses that housed the school has since been turned into apartments, the other is now a nursery. Kingswood College (originally St Wyburn's) is now housed outside Southport at Scarisbrick Hall, but it <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> pupils from the town. Brighthelmston School (girls) and University School (boys) are long closed.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Hammer Films {{produced}} Dracula, a newer, more Gothic {{version of}} the story, starring Christopher Lee as Dracula and Peter Cushing as Abraham Van Helsing. In 2004 it was named by Total Film magazine as the 30th-greatest British film of all time. Although it <b>takes</b> <b>many</b> liberties with the novel's plot, the creepy atmosphere and charismatic performances of Lee and Cushing make it memorable. It was released in the United States as Horror of Dracula to avoid confusion with the earlier Lugosi version. This {{was followed by a}} long series of Dracula films, usually featuring Lee as Dracula. It was Lee who fixed the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture.|$|E
