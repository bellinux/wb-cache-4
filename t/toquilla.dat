50|$|Carludovica palmata (Panama hat {{plant or}} <b>toquilla</b> palm) is a palm-like monocot plant. It {{is not a}} true palm. Its leaves are {{different}} from the leaves of true palms, and unlike true palms it does not develop a woody trunk. Its female flowers (which mature first) have large stigmas, and its male flowers (which mature later) have a lot of pollen. They reproduce vegetatively, because they do not produce viable seeds.|$|E
