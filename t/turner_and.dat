5|$|In 1986, J.Scott <b>Turner</b> <b>and</b> C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. <b>Turner</b> <b>and</b> Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E

5|$|The poem was {{published}} by Ellis and White in November 1876, although the date appeared on the imprint as 1877. They issued a second edition in 1877 and a third in 1880. The book was brought out again in 1887 by Reeves and <b>Turner,</b> <b>and</b> in 1896 by Longman. In 1898, two years after Morris's death, a revised text {{was published}} by the Kelmscott Press in an edition limited to 160 paper copies and 6 vellum copies, with wood cuts by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. In 1910 Longman issued an edition in which some passages were replaced with prose summaries by Winifred <b>Turner</b> <b>and</b> Helen Scott. In 1911 the same firm reprinted the original version as volume 12 of The Collected Works of William Morris, with an introduction by May Morris; {{in the absence of}} a critical edition this is the one generally cited by scholars. In recent years Sigurd the Volsung has been frequently reprinted, sometimes in the <b>Turner</b> <b>and</b> Scott abridged version.|$|E

25|$|Pitched battles were {{fought on}} September 14 for {{possession}} of the South Mountain passes: Crampton's, <b>Turner's,</b> <b>and</b> Fox's Gaps. Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill defended <b>Turner's</b> <b>and</b> Fox's Gaps against Burnside. To the south, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws defended Crampton's Gap against Franklin, {{who was able to}} break through at Crampton's Gap, but the Confederates were able to hold <b>Turner's</b> <b>and</b> Fox's, if only precariously. Lee realized the futility of his position against the numerically superior Union forces, and he ordered his troops to Sharpsburg. McClellan was then theoretically in a position to destroy Lee's army before it could concentrate. McClellan's limited activity on September 15 after his victory at South Mountain, however, condemned the garrison at Harpers Ferry to capture and gave Lee time to unite his scattered divisions at Sharpsburg.|$|R
