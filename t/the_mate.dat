5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA testing to determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E

5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate {{guarding}} {{during the period}} females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly {{on the side and}} following <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} {{calculate}} joint gene frequencies, {{which are the}} probabilities that two neutral genes taken at random from a population have certain allelic states, is developed {{taking into account the}} effects of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> system and <b>the</b> mutation scheme.

Under either—the condition that mutation rates are symmetric or that <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> unit is large and the mutation rate is small—the general formula is represented by two terms, one for <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> system and <b>the</b> other for the mutation scheme. The term for <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> system is expressed using the coancestry coefficient in the infinite allele model, and the term for the mutation scheme {{is a function of the}} eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the mutation matrix.

40|$|Abstract Background Sexual {{morphological}} {{features are}} known to be associated with <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> systems of several animal groups. However, {{it has been suggested that}} morphological features other than sexual characteristics could also be constrained by <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> system as a consequence of negative associations. Schistosomatidae are parasitic organisms that vary in mating system and can thus be used to explore links between <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> system and negative associations with morphological features. Results A comparative analysis of Schistosomatidae morphological features revealed an association between <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> system (monogamous versus polygynandrous) and morphological characteristics of reproduction, nutrition, and locomotion. Conclusions <b>The</b> <b>mating</b> system drives negative associations between somatic and sexual morphological features. In monogamous species, males display a lower investment in sexual tissues and a higher commitment of resources to tissues involved in female transport, protection, and feeding assistance. In contrast, males of polygynandrous species invest to a greater extent in sexual tissues at the cost of reduced commitment to female care. </p...|$|R

25|$|On 23 October 1827, John Palmer was at Lahaina, Hawaii. There {{local women}} {{came on board}} and bartered sexual favors for goods, in {{violation}} of the local government's prohibition of such activities. When Clark took a boat ashore, Maui Governor Hoapili, responding to concerns of Christian missionaries living there, seized Clark and the sailors manning the boat. Hoapili agreed to release the men on the understanding that Clark would land the women at Lahaina. Clark had left instructions with <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> to fire some shots if Clark had not returned in an hour. Before Clark returned to John Palmer <b>the</b> <b>mate</b> fired five 9-pounder shots towards the house of the missionary William Richards, some of which landed in the yard without doing serious damage. Richards and his wife took shelter in the basement. Clark and his men returned to John Palmer and then sailed off without landing the women.|$|E
40|$|The {{change of}} <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> factor {{activity}} during {{the culture of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae X- 2180 IB, an a-mating type haploid strain, were followed. The activity increased rapidly during the exponential phase of growth, reached a maximum during the early stationary phase and then decreased. Oligopeptides comprising partial sequences of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> factor were isolated from the culture fluids at various phases of cell growth. We concluded that <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> factor, a tridecapeptide, was degraded during culture into two peptides, Trp-His-Trp-Leu-Gln-Leu and Lys-Pro-GIy-Gln-Pro-Met-Tyr, by cleavage of the peptide bond between Lcu- 6 and Lys- 7 of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> factor. A dodecapeptide lacking the N-terminal Trp residue was not detected at any stage of cell growth examined. Mating factor is excreted by ar-mating type cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and acts on a-mating type cells as an inhibitor of the initiation of DNA synthesis in the cells (1, 2).

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mating</b> type locus (MTL) of Candida albicans {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> type {{genes and}} has, therefore, been assumed {{to play an}} exclusive role in <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> process.

Since it had been previously demonstrated that deleting either the a/α copy of the entire MTL locus, or either MTLa 1 or MTLα 2, affected virulence, we hypothesized that the NSGs in the MTL locus may {{also play a role}} in pathogenesis. Here by mutational analysis, it is demonstrated that both <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> type and nonsex genes in the MTL locus play roles in a/α biofilm formation, and that OBP is essential for impermeability and fluconazole resistance...|$|R

40|$|Mating {{status is}} one of the most {{important}} predictors of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> propensity of an individual. This is because <b>mating</b> lowers <b>the</b> amount of sperm cells and seminal fluids available to donate for males and increases the amount of ejaculate received by females, which may both have an effect on <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> propensity. In simultaneous hermaphrodites with reciprocal copulation, <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> status is expected to affect <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> propensity in both the male and the female sex function within a single individual, but empirical evidence is scarce. We experimentally tested the effect of <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> status of an individual and its partner on copulatory and postcopulatory behaviour in the free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano, an outcrossing simultaneous hermaphrodite. These worms have frequent reciprocal copulations and often display a postcopulatory suck behaviour, potentially involved in removing ejaculate components from their own sperm-receiving organ. Virgin pairs copulated more, earlier and for longer than sexually experienced pairs. Moreover, we observed fewer sucks in virgin than sexually experienced pairs, all consistent with a higher willingness both to donate and to receive sperm in virgins. We investigated whether the lower suck frequency in virgin pairs depends on <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> status of <b>the</b> focal individual or on that of its partner. Surprisingly, the results suggested that the suck frequency depends on <b>the</b> <b>mating</b> status of <b>the</b> partner.
