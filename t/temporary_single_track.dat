50|$|The first {{railway bridge}} across the River Tyne at this {{location}} was a timber bridge completed in 1839. This was destroyed by fire caused by hot ash from a passing train in 1860. A wooden replacement opened in 1861 which was then replaced by a <b>temporary</b> <b>single</b> <b>track</b> bridge in 1865.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{initially}} built <b>temporary</b> as a <b>single</b> <b>track</b> and to lower construction standards than planned with some narrow curves and steep inclines. The Teltow-Friedrichsfelde Ost section was completed on 16 December 1940 and the extension to Karow followed on 22 September 1941. Work began on duplicating {{the southern part}} of the line in 1944. The second track was completed from Teltow to Lichtenrade and the crossing loop at Osdorf was abandoned. It is not known whether the second track was completed to Großziethen or beyond.|$|R

50|$|This {{subdivision}} {{is mostly}} double track with only 2 segments of <b>single</b> <b>track.</b> An approximately three mile segment of <b>single</b> <b>track</b> exists between Gregory and Little Falls {{and sees the}} crossing of the Mississippi River.

40|$|In Selective Laser Melting, {{the initial}} units {{produced}} are <b>single</b> <b>tracks</b> that overlap {{to create a}} single layer; from the sequence of layers, a 3 D object is manufactured. The properties of the parts produced by SLM depend heavily on the properties of each <b>single</b> <b>track</b> and each layer formed by these tracks. This study evaluates the effect of processing parameters on the geometrical characteristics of <b>single</b> <b>tracks</b> manufactured from 17 - 4 PH stainless steel powder. A single-mode continuous-wave ytterbium fibre laser was used to manufacture <b>single</b> <b>tracks</b> at laser powers {{in the range of}} 100 - 300 W with a constant spot size of ∼ 80 μm. The <b>single</b> <b>tracks</b> produced were subjected to standard metallographic preparation techniques for further analysis with an optical microscope. Deep molten pool shapes were observed at low scan speeds, while shallow molten pool shapes were observed at high scan speeds. At higher laser power densities, under-cutting and humping effects were also observed. The dimensions of <b>single</b> <b>tracks</b> processed without powder generally decrease with increasing scan speed at constant laser power. However, the geometrical features of the <b>single</b> <b>tracks</b> processed with powder revealed pronounced irregularities believed to be caused by non-homogeneity in the deposited powder layer...|$|R
50|$|Converting a {{single-track}} railway {{to double}} track is called duplication or doubling; converting double <b>track</b> to <b>single</b> <b>track</b> {{is known as}} singling. A double-track railway operating only a <b>single</b> <b>track</b> is known as single-line working.|$|R
25|$|The section from Plimmerton to South Junction (a little {{north of}} Muri Station {{at the top}} of the Paekakariki Hill) and from North Junction (at the {{northern}} portal of northern Paekakariki tunnel) to Paekakariki was completed in 1940. The difficult <b>single</b> <b>track</b> section between South and North Junctions that passed through five short <b>single</b> <b>track</b> tunnels was left as <b>single</b> <b>track.</b> A proposal that the tunnels on the section between South and North Junctions be replaced with a <b>single</b> double <b>track</b> tunnel has been considered but has not so far been approved.|$|R
25|$|Both trains were on {{the same}} section of <b>single</b> <b>track</b> that runs between the Chatsworth station (which is double tracked) through the Santa Susana Pass. The line returns to double track again as it enters the Simi Valley. Three tunnels under the pass are only wide enough to support a <b>single</b> <b>track,</b> and it would be very costly to widen them. This <b>single</b> <b>track</b> section carries 24 {{passenger}} trains and 12 freight trains each day.|$|R
50|$|The whole {{line was}} {{originally}} <b>single</b> <b>track.</b> By 1850, the -to- section had been doubled, extending to Skipton by 1853. However, Morecambe-to-Lancaster remained <b>single</b> <b>track</b> until 1877, and Lancaster-to-Hornby until 1889. The curve {{between the two}} Lancaster stations was never doubled.|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} {{contributing}} factors {{to the cause}} and severity of the collision. Because of scheduled maintenance only a <b>single</b> <b>track</b> was available between the lower level platforms of Amsterdam Sloterdijk and Amsterdam Centraal station. In the modified timetable the intercity and the local train were supposed to use that short section of <b>single</b> <b>track</b> only three minutes after each other, for which the local train was supposed to wait for one minute at the signal before passing. Three minutes is the minimum time interval for passages over <b>single</b> <b>track</b> sections allowed by regulation. Because of a delayed freighter train the intercity was two minutes late, causing the trains {{to arrive at the}} <b>single</b> <b>track</b> section simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|The line is {{predominantly}} <b>single</b> <b>track</b> with passing loops at some stations. There are two longer sections of double track between Nacka - Saltsjö-Järla and Storängen - Saltsjö-Duvnäs totalling 2.5 km which reduces delays waiting for trains {{in the opposite}} direction.

5000|$|In 1936 {{the line}} was further {{extended}} one mile (1.6 km) east to Green Road.

The <b>single</b> <b>track</b> continues for a short distance until Crawford, south of Prairie du Chien, where it once again becomes double track which lasts all the way to Grand Crossing, where the line becomes the St. Croix Subdivision.|$|R

Between Uppsala and Gävle, which are double track, except a {{bottleneck}} south of Gävle, there are sections which allow for 160 km/h. North of Gävle, the line consists of <b>single</b> <b>track,</b> mostly with lower speed. Apart from Ljusne-Enånger, around Söderhamn where the old <b>single</b> <b>track</b> was replaced with 40 km new <b>single</b> <b>track</b> in the 1990's with a maximum speed of 200 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, the <b>single</b> <b>track</b> railway was duplicated. Two new {{concrete}} railway bridges {{were constructed}} {{and the old}} steel bridge placed out of use. Having two new <b>single</b> <b>track</b> bridges, separated by about a metre, rather than one double track bridge is more robust, since a problem affecting one <b>single</b> <b>track</b> bridge is less likely (though not guaranteed) to affect the other <b>single</b> <b>track</b> bridge. The separate spans also allow rail-mounted cranes on the surviving bridge {{to get close to}} clear debris on the affected track, a problem with the Nzi River bridge collapse.The new bridges are likely to allow increased axle loads and speeds. The old and new bridges are about 50m apart, and the new bridge seem to be at a higher level than the old one. The new bridges are [...] gauge.|$|R
