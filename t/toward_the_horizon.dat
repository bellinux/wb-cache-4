500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] {{starts with}} scenes {{of a black}} {{helicopter}} flying over the desert. In some of the shots, Diddy can be seen looking out on to the horizon. As the song progresses into its main verses, the camera follows Diddy walking through the desert. In the background and foreground, the fire-damaged remnants of a home such as a TV set, fur coats and a stereo system are scattered across the landscape. During the chorus Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take place {{in front of the}} camera, walking behind Diddy miming Grey's words. Later in the clip, during the second verse, Diddy sits in a burned out building singing to himself. Outside, a burned out vehicle is parked. Then during the song's bridge, red smoke surrounds Diddy as the helicopter, from the opening scene, comes to land. However, this time Richard and Harper are seated inside waiting for Diddy. As the song fades, the helicopter flies over the desert <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can only have its polarization {{in the direction of}} that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop Yagi or log-periodic antenna with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical [...] "whip antenna" [...] or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A turnstile antenna with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the [...] "axial mode" [...] (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.|$|E

2500|$|While off Truk on 18 January 1943, Silversides torpedoed {{and sank}} her largest {{target of the}} war, the 10,022 ton oil tanker Toei Maru. Two days later, the {{submarine}} had {{one of her most}} productive days of the war. [...] After paralleling a convoy throughout the daylight hours, she moved on ahead at sundown and lay in wait (an end around position). As the targets moved into range, Silversides fired torpedoes at overlapping targets and sank three enemy ships—the cargo ships Surabaya Maru, Somedono Maru, and Meiu Maru. The attack had scarcely abated when it was discovered that an armed torpedo was stuck in a forward torpedo tube. Since it was impossible to disarm the torpedo, the commanding officer decided to attempt to refire it, an extremely dangerous maneuver. The submarine moved in reverse at top speed and fired. The torpedo shot safely from the tube, disappearing as it moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

60|$|The sun {{had long}} slanted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> western <b>horizon</b> when I saw the blue smoke of our camp-fire among the pines. The hounds rose up and barked as Don trotted {{in to the}} blaze, and my companions just sitting to a dinner, gave me a noisy greeting.|$|R

60|$|Another sudden boom, like a cannon-shot, silenced {{the noise}} inside for an instant, {{and then a}} sudden {{movement}} took place, the movement of feet passing hurriedly about, and at last {{only one or two}} persons could be heard.

5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise on <b>the</b> eastern <b>horizon</b> and set on <b>the</b> western <b>horizon.</b> North latitude is {{fairly easy to}} determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> indicates <b>the</b> viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> equator, Polaris appears to descend <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>horizon.</b> At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above <b>the</b> northern <b>horizon.</b> Near <b>the</b> equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below <b>the</b> northern <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
60|$|Of {{a sudden}} {{she noticed that}} an imitation-lace cover which should have lain mathematically square with the imitation-marble top of the {{radiator}} behind the green plush sofa had slipped away so that one corner hung over the bronze-painted steam pipes. She recalled that she must have rested her poor head against the radiator-top while she was taking off her boots. She {{tried to get up}} and set the thing straight, but the radiator at once receded <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> which, unlike true horizons, slanted diagonally, exactly parallel with the dropped lace edge of the cover.

60|$|But {{that was}} a mistake. We saw the Cross to-night, {{and it is not}} large. Not large, and not strikingly bright. But it was low down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> and it may improve when it gets up higher in the sky. It is ingeniously named, for it looks just as a cross would look if it looked like {{something}} else. But that description does not describe; it is too vague, too general, too indefinite. It does after a fashion suggest a cross -- a cross that is out of repair--or out of drawing; not correctly shaped. It is long, with a short cross-bar, and the cross-bar is canted out of the straight line.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the American West and its unique American-ness is intimately {{associated}} with our advances in mobility. Foot travel, wagon and ox, railroad, and, finally, automobile.

60|$|To me the veldt, in its sober winter garb, was surpassingly beautiful. There were unlevel {{stretches}} {{where it}} was rolling and swelling, and rising and subsiding, and sweeping superbly on and on, and still on and on like an ocean, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> faraway <b>horizon,</b> its pale brown deepening by delicately graduated shades to rich orange, and finally to purple and crimson {{where it was}}hed against the wooded hills and naked red crags {{at the base of}} the sky.|$|R
40|$|This paper reconsiders the {{properties}} of Hawking radiation in <b>the</b> inner <b>horizon</b> of a Reissner-Nordström black hole. Through the correlation between temperature and surface gravity, it is concluded that the temperature of <b>the</b> inner <b>horizon</b> is always negative and that of <b>the</b> outer <b>horizon</b> is always positive. Since negative temperature is hotter than any positive temperature, it is predicted that particle radiation from <b>the</b> inner <b>horizon</b> will move <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>horizon.</b> However, unlike temperature, entropy in both horizons remains positive. Following the definition of negative temperature in <b>the</b> inner <b>horizon,</b> it is assured that the entropy {{of a black hole}} within a closed system can never decrease. By analyzing the conditions of an extremal black hole, the third law of black hole thermodynamics can be extended to multi-horizon black holes...|$|R
60|$|To me, Dejah Thoris was {{all that}} was perfect; all that was virtuous and {{beautiful}} and noble and good.

60|$|A {{little way}} {{from the end of}} our journey we got out and {{dismissed}} the cab. He could not too soon know the scents and pavements of this London where the chief of his life must pass. I can see now his first bumble down that wide, back-water of a street, how continually and suddenly he sat down to make sure of his own legs, how continually he lost our heels. He showed us then in full perfection what was afterwards to be an inconvenient--if endearing--characteristic: At any call or whistle he would look in precisely the opposite direction. How many times all through his life have I not seen him, at my whistle, start violently and turn his tail to me, then, with nose thrown searchingly from side to side, begin to canter <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
60|$|On the one hand, {{a mighty}} sea of yellow sand {{stretched}} away toward {{the ends of}} the earth, solemn, silent, shorn of vegetation, its solitude uncheered by any forms of creature life; on the other, the Eden of Egypt was spread below us--a broad green floor, cloven by the sinuous river, dotted with villages, its vast distances measured and marked by the diminishing stature of receding clusters of palms. It lay asleep in an enchanted atmosphere. There was no sound, no motion. Above the date-plumes in the middle distance, swelled a domed and pinnacled mass, glimmering through a tinted, exquisite mist; away <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> a dozen shapely pyramids watched over ruined Memphis: and at our feet the bland impassible Sphynx looked out upon the picture from her throne in the sands as placidly and pensively as she had looked upon its like full fifty lagging centuries ago.|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} taking my turn with the others in {{defending}} the approach to our lofty retreat when Mors Kajak, who had been watching the battle in the street below, called aloud in sudden excitement.

60|$|We {{had come}} {{almost to the}} gate {{when one of the}} party called to his fellows, at the same time {{pointing}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> distant southern <b>horizon.</b> Following <b>the</b> direction he indicated, my eyes descried the hull of a large flier approaching rapidly from above the crest of the encircling hills.|$|R
60|$|The {{acceleration}} of my torpid pulse in the keen {{fight with the}} wind, whose violence was almost {{equal to that of}} a tornado, and the familiar faces of the bright stars above me, I felt as a blessed relief. I ran not knowing whither, and when I halted, the square outline of the house was lost in the alder bushes. An uninterrupted plain stretched before me, like a vast sea beaten flat by the force of the gale. As I kept on I noticed a slight elevation <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> and presently my progress was impeded by the ascent of an Indian mound. It struck me forcibly as resembling an island in the sea. Its height gave me a better view of the expanding plain. But even here I found no rest. The ridiculous interpretation Tryan had given the climate was somehow sung in my ears, and echoed in my throbbing pulse as, guided by the star, I sought the house again.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the furious}} {{struggle}} they witnessed, the elements did not cease their functions; and, urged by the breeze, and lifted irresistibly on a wave, the American ship was forced {{through the water}} still further across the bows of her enemy. The idle fastenings of hemp and iron were snapped asunder like strings of tow, and Griffith saw his own ship borne away from the Englishman at the instant that the bowsprit of the latter was torn from its lashings, and tumbled into the sea, followed by spar after spar, until nothing of all her proud tackling was remaining, but the few parted and useless ropes that were left dangling along the stumps of her lower masts. As his own stately vessel moved from the confusion she had caused, and left the dense cloud of smoke in which her helpless antagonist lay, {{the eye of the}} young man glanced anxiously <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> where he now remembered he had more foes to contend against.|$|E
6000|$|The gale {{continued}} to blow heavily {{during the whole}} of that morning; but toward noon the usual indications of better weather became apparent. During these few hours of inaction in the frigate, the marines, who were drafted for service on the land, moved through the vessel with a busy and stirring air, {{as if they were}} about to participate in the glory and danger of the campaign their officer had planned, while the few seamen who were to accompany the expedition steadily paced the deck, with their hands thrust into the bosoms of their neat blue jackets, or occasionally stretched <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> as their fingers traced, for their less experienced shipmates, the signs of an abatement in the gale among the driving clouds. The last lagger among the soldiers had appeared, with his knapsack on his back, in the lee gangway, where his comrades were collected, armed and accoutered for the strife, when Captain Munson ascended to the quarter-deck, accompanied by the stranger and his first lieutenant.
