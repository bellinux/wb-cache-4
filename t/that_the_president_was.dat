5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was {{presiding}} over the Senate—a task given to junior members—when an aide rushed in {{to tell him that}} his brother, President John F. Kennedy, had been shot. His brother Robert soon told him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> dead. Ted and his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver immediately flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to give the news to their invalid father, who had been afflicted by a stroke suffered two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} before the shooting, Vice President George H. W. Bush {{received}} the assignment of running crisis management in case of emergency despite Secretary of State Alexander Haig's objection. When the White House learned of the assassination attempt, however, Bush was over Texas aboard Air Force Two, which did not have secure voice communications, and his discussions with the White House were intercepted and given to the press. The vice president was notified in Fort Worth, Texas of the shooting within eight minutes, but relying on the initial reports that Reagan was unharmed his plane flew to Austin for a speech. After learning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> wounded, Air Force Two refueled in Austin before returning to Washington at what its pilot described as the fastest speed in the plane's history.|$|E

5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I. In early September, {{it was decided to}} bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.|$|E
5|$|On 1October 1965, a {{group of}} Indonesian National Armed Forces members calling {{themselves}} the 30September Movement killed six Army generals and announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> under their power; the coup was quashed the following day. Contemporary reports indicated that the PKI had been behind the G30S, a position endorsed by the Indonesian government. As a result, {{hundreds of thousands of}} registered and suspected PKI members were killed or exiled over the following decade, effectively destroying the Party. By 1974 Buru held some 10,000prisoners, while others were held elsewhere or forced to stay abroad. Political prisoners began to be released by the 1970s, but saw systematic discrimination at all levels of society: they found themselves under surveillance and with little hope of employment.|$|E
5|$|White House Counsel Fred Fielding {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} a transfer of presidential powers under the 25th Amendment, and Chief of Staff James A. Baker and Counselor to the President Edwin Meese went to Reagan's hospital still believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> unharmed. Within five minutes of the shooting, members of the Cabinet began gathering in the White House Situation Room. Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and National Security Advisor Richard Allen discussed various issues, including {{the location of the}} nuclear football, the apparent presence of more than the usual number of Soviet submarines unusually close off the Atlantic coast, a possible Soviet invasion of Poland against the Solidarity movement, and the presidential line of succession. Although normally no tape recorders are allowed in the Situation Room these meetings were recorded with the participants' knowledge by Allen, and the tapes have since been made public.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Đính was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} III Corps, which oversaw the region surrounding the capital Saigon. He was given the post because Diệm regarded {{him as one of}} his most loyal officers. This position meant that Đính would be important to {{the success or failure of}} any coup. In late 1963, with Diệm becoming increasingly unpopular, Đính's colleagues recruited him into a coup by playing on his ego. They convinced him to ask Diệm for a cabinet post, knowing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> adamantly opposed to military officers serving as ministers and would chastise him. Diệm promptly rebuffed Đính, who became upset and was lured into the plot. Diệm and his brother and chief advisor Ngô Đình Nhu were aware of a coup plot, but did not know of Đính's involvement. Nhu planned a fake coup of his own in an attempt to trap his opponents and generate positive publicity for his family's regime. He put Đính in charge of the fake coup, and the general promptly redeployed loyal units outside Saigon and rebel forces near the capital. On 1 November 1963, the rebels' actual coup proceeded, and the Ngô brothers were deposed and executed.|$|E

25|$|Debate largely {{focuses on}} the {{question}} of whether, before 1949, the head of state was the President of Ireland, or King George VI. The Constitution did not directly refer to the King, but also did not (and still does not) state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> head of state. The President exercised most of the usual internal functions of a head of state, such as formally appointing the Government, and promulgating laws.|$|E
25|$|At 1:00p.m., CST (19:00 UTC), the President was {{pronounced}} dead after all heart activity had ceased. Father Oscar Huber administered the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church.

President Kennedy's death was officially announced by White House Acting Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff at 1:33p.m. CST (19:33 UTC). Kilduff was acting press secretary on the trip because Pierre Salinger was traveling to Japan with half the Cabinet, including Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Governor Connally, meanwhile, was taken to emergency surgery, where he underwent two operations that day.|$|E

25|$|Within {{twenty seconds}} of the announcement, every CBS {{affiliate}} except Dallas' KRLD (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network's feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made {{on the life of}} the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> dead but stressed it was not confirmed.|$|E

25|$|A Rwandan {{colonel who}} called the army command about 40 minutes after the crash was told {{that there was no}} {{confirmation}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> dead. About half an hour later, roughly 9:30, the situation was still confused at army command, though it appeared clear that the presidential aircraft had exploded and that it had probably been hit by a missile. News arrived that Major-General Déogratias Nsabimana, the army chief of staff, had been on the plane. The officers present realized {{that they would have to}} appoint a new chief of staff in order to clarify the chain of command and began a meeting to decide whom to appoint. Col. Bagosora joined them soon afterward. At about 10 pm, Ephrem Rwabalinda, the government liaison officer to UNAMIR, called Dallaire to inform him that a crisis committee was about to meet. After informing his superiors in New York City of the situation, Dallaire went to attend the meeting, where he found Bagosora in charge.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Garrison meets a {{high-level}} figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as [...] "X" [...] (Donald Sutherland).

X explains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> killed because he wanted to pull the United States out of the Vietnam War and dismantle the CIA. X encourages Garrison to keep digging and prosecute New Orleans-based international businessman Clay Shaw for his alleged involvement. When Shaw is interrogated, the businessman denies any knowledge of meeting Ferrie, O'Keefe or Oswald, but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder the President.|$|E
