Other competitive Tekken players have expressed <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> for Lars, though one stated he enjoyed him more in Tag Tournament 2 over Tekken 6 due to how Namco managed to balance him. The character has also been popular with cosplayers; most notably, in 2012 a Brazilian duo won an award at the 2012 World Cosplay Summit for cosplaying as Lars and Alisa.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E

5|$|Solar 2 {{is an open}} world sandbox {{video game}} played from a {{two-dimensional}} perspective. The player is given an asteroid, and their main mission is to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects. The game ends when and if the player manages to accumulate enough mass to become a big crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. However, the player is free to not finish the game, {{and is able to}} stay at the form of the object of <b>their</b> <b>preference.</b> Six different object are available in the game: small planet, life planet, small star, medium star, large star and black hole.|$|E
5|$|Ruiz {{also noted}} that these {{subspecies}} differed in <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> of soil substrate. He first noted this while attempting to find the population of plants from which Humboldt and Bonpland had collected their type specimens in 1803. Although Ruiz {{was able to find}} many populations of the species growing in the areas that Humboldt and Bonpland had visited in the vicinity if Mina de Moran, only one population, the only one growing on limestone, matched H.B.K.'s description and their type and isotype specimens now housed in the herbarium of the French national museum of natural history. The other populations in the area grew on substrate of igneous origin and more closely matched Hooker's 1846 description of P. orchidioides. These latter plants then became the new variety, P. moranensis ssp. neovolcanica.|$|E

The Waterloo Regional Campus is located in downtown Kitchener, sharing facilities with the Health Sciences Campus of the University of Waterloo. The campus in St. Catharines is at Brock University's Niagara Health and Bioscience Research Complex. Approximately 30 medical students in each year of the program attend each campus. Those who apply to McMaster's School of Medicine are asked to rank their site choice (Hamilton, Niagara Region, Waterloo Region) from first to third, or no preference. Offers of admission to the medical school are made from a rank list irrespective of geographical preference. Subsequent to an applicant's acceptance, registrants to the class are placed based on <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> and geographical background. The offers given out by McMaster are bound to the assigned site.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} strategic {{behavior in}} a centralized matching clearinghouse based on the Gale–Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm. To do so, we conduct a laboratory experiment to test {{the degree to which}} agents strategically misrepresent <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> by submitting a “truncation” of <b>their</b> true <b>preferences.</b> Our experimental design uses a restricted environment in which a particular form of truncation is always a best response. We find that subjects do not truncate <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> more often when truncation is profitable. They do, however, truncate <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> less often when truncation is dangerous – that is, when there is a risk of “over-truncating” and remaining unmatched. Our findings suggest that behavioral insights can {{play an important role in}} the field of market design...|$|R

5|$|The city lay {{within the}} kingdom of Mauretania, which became a Roman client state {{following}} the fall of Carthage in 146BC. The Punic influence lasted for a considerable time afterwards, as the city's magistrates retained the Carthaginian title of suffete long {{after the end of}} Punic rule. Juba II of Numidia was placed on the Mauretanian throne by Augustus in 25BC and turned his attention to building a royal capital at Volubilis. Educated in Rome and married to Cleopatra Selene II, the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, Juba and his son Ptolemy were thoroughly Romanised kings, although of Berber ancestry; <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> for Roman art and architecture was clearly reflected in the city's design.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{takeover}} of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout {{was approved by the}} council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium is built, Anfield would be demolished. The land would become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would include a hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, and interest rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as <b>their</b> <b>preference</b> was to re-develop Anfield.|$|E

40|$|In a multi-agent context where a set {{of agents}} {{declares}} <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> over {{a common set of}} candidates, it is often the case that such agents interact and exchange opinions before voting. In this initial phase, agents may influence each other and therefore modify <b>their</b> <b>preferences,</b> until hopefully they reach a stable state. Recent work has modelled the influence phenomenon in the case of voting over a single issue. Here we generalize this model to account for preferences over combinatorially structured domains including several issues. When agents express <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> as CP-nets, we show how to model influence functions and to aggregate preferences by possibly interleaving voting and influence convergence. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe current article aims to {{investigate}} the possible effects of Iranian EFL learners’ age, gender and proficiency level on <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for corrective feedback provider. To meet this end, a questionnaire was distributed among 147 Iranian EFL learners to choose <b>their</b> <b>preferences</b> for corrective feedback provider.

Moreover the results indicated that teens and young adults were more eager to be corrected by the teacher, whereas adults preferred to be corrected by both their teachers and their classmates...|$|R
