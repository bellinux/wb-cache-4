50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} Devon GTX included an aircraft-quality carbon fiber body, “up and forward” <b>articulating</b> <b>doors,</b> two-tone wheel surrounds, minimal front/rear overhangs, dual center exhaust ports and carbon fiber racing seats.|$|R
50|$|Structures are {{typically}} {{based on a}} rectangular floor plan, and feature massive, symmetrical primary façades. Stuccoed walls, red tiled roofs, windows {{in the shape of}} arches or circles, one or two stories, wood or wrought iron balconies with window grilles, and <b>articulated</b> <b>door</b> surrounds are characteristic. Keystones were occasionally employed. Ornamentation may be simple or dramatic. Lush gardens often appear.|$|R

5000|$|The Coot, that {{featured}} an <b>articulated</b> <b>twin</b> hull, kept {{all of its}} four wheels {{on the ground as}} much as possible, even when driving on very rough terrain. In production from 1967 - 1985.|$|R
50|$|Transit buses can be single-decker, double-decker, rigid or articulated. Selection of type has {{traditionally}} been made on a regional as well as operational basis; however, {{with the advent of}} global manufacturing, all of these types {{can be seen in the}} same location or country. Depending on local policies, transit buses will also usually have two, three or (for <b>articulated)</b> four <b>doors</b> to facilitate rapid boarding and alighting.|$|R
5000|$|A car {{was shown}} at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 and 1925 and tested by the LNER. To provide a better service to compete with raising levels of road traffic two of these {{articulated}} [...] two-cylinder chain-driven units were purchased, and operated in the Lowestoft area. This was followed by 22 cars to a similar design in 1927 and 1928. A prototype cardan shaft driven car with a rigid body was built in 1927 and between 1928 and 1930 forty-nine cars with six cylinder cardan shafts drives and rigid bodies were purchased, followed by five [...] cars in 1930 and 1932 and Phenomena, a <b>twin</b> <b>articulated</b> pair with two 100 hp six cylinder motors, in 1930. This could seat 39 in the power car and 83 in the trailer. Between 1927 and 1943 a number were allocated to Heaton shed, near Newcastle upon Tyne, and operated to [...] and over the Tyne Valley Line to [...] and [...] On 9 June 1929, railcar No. 220 Waterwitch overran signals at Marshgate Junction, Doncaster and was consequently in collision with an excursion train. The railcar was cut in two. It was not repaired.|$|R
50|$|The Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier (ATTC) is a <b>twin</b> chassis {{multi-purpose}} <b>articulated</b> tracked carrier jointly {{developed by}} ST Kinetics and the Defence Science & Technology Agency (DSTA) for the Singapore Army. The variant {{which was in}} service with the UK armed forces {{is known as the}} Warthog.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only the}} {{community}} members were expert and specialized in stone cutting {{and construction of}} forts, palaces, temples and buildings {{but they were also}} skilled architects and artisans who could do <b>articulate</b> carvings of <b>doors,</b> windows, pillars, and statues of gods and goddesses and ceilings.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) updated and {{expanded}} the original North Eastern Railway {{of the electric}} suburban Tyneside system. The original NER electric units built in 1904-15 were replaced with 64 new <b>articulated</b> <b>twins,</b> 112 ft long, and two luggage vans. Two new parcel vans were built in 1938.|$|R
5000|$|For 2003, {{a number}} of changes and {{improvements}} {{were made to the}} Navigator thanks to a thorough redesign. The Navigator continued to share a platform with the Ford Expedition, which was also redesigned for 2003, but continued to differ from it in terms of styling and various upscale features. The 2003 redesign featured a thoroughly revised exterior, the first since the Navigator's launch, with only the front doors and roof panel unchanged from the previous generation. The new exterior came with things such as a larger chrome waterfall grille, brighter quad-beam headlights with larger housings, revised chrome door handles set in color-keyed bezels, and slightly wider running boards. Inside the Navigator was an all-new instrument panel and dashboard area which, significantly, was not shared with the Expedition. Inspired by the symmetrical, [...] "dual-cockpit" [...] layout of the 1961 Lincoln Continental, the instrument panel and dashboard area was adorned with real walnut burl wood inserts and panels and switches painted with a low-luster satin nickel color. Adding to the upscale interior design further were white LEDs, 120 in all, which provided backlighting for controls and switches. Additionally, to direct attention to the high-quality satin nickel-faced analog clock mounted in the dashboard, an <b>articulating</b> <b>door</b> is present to conceal the radio head unit and optional satellite navigation system when they are not in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{product range}} of Centroliner included: midibus, full-size/articulated single-decker, and three-axle double-decker, in {{different}} body lengths. The rigids had 1 door, 2 door or 3 <b>doors</b> whereas the <b>articulated</b> have 2 <b>doors,</b> 3 doors or 4 doors. After {{the acquisition of}} Neoplan by MAN AG subsidy MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, {{a new version of}} Centroliner full-size/articulated single-decker was launched, it was also known as Neoplan Centroliner Evolution.|$|R
40|$|Legislatures {{across the}} United States have passed laws to combat {{strategic}} lawsuits against public participation (“SLAPPs”) —suits brought solely to harass {{a party that}} has exercised protected speech or petitioning activity. Federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction have struggled to determine whether these nominally procedural laws—particularly their hallmark special motions to dismiss—apply outside of state courts. A proper reading of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure reveals that these laws may operate harmoniously alongside the federal system, and the <b>twin</b> aims <b>articulated</b> in the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins favor application of anti-SLAPP laws in federal fora. Furthermore, even if the laws and the Rules directly conflict, it would violate the Rules Enabling Act to apply the Federal Rule in preemption of the state anti-SLAPP statute...|$|R
50|$|The LNER {{electric}} {{units were}} electric multiple units that {{ran on the}} Tyneside Electrics, a suburban system based on the English city of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1937 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) received <b>articulated</b> <b>twin</b> passenger electric units to replace the NER electric units that had been built in 1904-15 by the North Eastern Railway. The order including some single-unit motor parcel vans and motor luggage vans. In the 1960s declining passenger numbers and {{the high cost of}} renewing life-expired electric substation equipment across the system led to the replacement of the electric multiple units with diesel multiple units and the units were all withdrawn in 1967.|$|R
5000|$|The Nebraska Zephyr was a {{streamlined}} {{passenger train}} {{operated by the}} Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q, commonly known by the shorter name of [...] "Burlington") between Chicago, Illinois, Omaha, Nebraska and Lincoln, Nebraska. It operated from 1947 to 1971. Until 1968 the two original <b>Twin</b> Cities Zephyr <b>articulated</b> trainsets, the [...] "Train of the Gods" [...] and [...] "Train of the Goddesses", operated the service and became synonymous with it. The Nebraska Zephyr {{was one of many}} trains discontinued when Amtrak began operations in 1971. The [...] "Train of the Goddess" [...] set is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois.|$|R
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} at Temple Emanu-El in New York City on February 24, 1912, Henrietta Szold {{together}} with other Zionist women, proposed to the Daughters of Zion study circle that they expand their purpose and embrace proactive work to help meet the health needs of Palestine's people. The goal was to promote the Zionist ideal through education, public health initiatives, and the training of nurses {{in what was then}} the Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire. Because the meeting was held around the time of Purim, the women called themselves [...] "The Hadassah chapter of the Daughters of Zion," [...] adopting the Hebrew name of Queen Esther. Henrietta Szold became the first president. Within a year, Hadassah had five growing chapters in New York, Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago and Boston. Its charter <b>articulates</b> <b>twin</b> goals: to begin public-health initiatives and nurses training in Palestine, and to foster Zionist ideals through education in America.|$|R
50|$|First class {{accommodation}} {{was provided}} when built {{but this was}} abolished on 4 May 1959 and all accommodation became second class (third class was redesignated second class throughout BR on 3 June 1956). Painted red and cream when new, in 1941 the stock was painted blue and off-white and green in the 1950s. Four versions of <b>articulated</b> <b>twin</b> were built: 12 x motor 3rd + trailer 3rd (designated Type A), 16 x luggage motor 3rd + trailer 1st (Type B), 18 x motor 3rd + trailer 3rd (non-driving) (Type C) and 18 x luggage motor 3rd + trailer 1st (non-driving) (Type D). Types A and B {{could be used as}} 2-car sets but Types C and D, with no driving cabs in the trailers, would be made up into longer sets with up to eight cars. The trailers of the Type B and Type D units each had 28 first-class seats, plus 32 (Type B) or 36 (Type D) seats which could be used for either first class or third class as required.|$|R
25|$|Due to its dual {{commercial}} and residential purpose, the building's facade design received a different treatment than those of most other homes of the time. Thus, in the first level, the neoclassical elements are austere; the exterior is <b>articulated</b> by the <b>doors</b> and windows openings. These openings are framed by moldings and pilasters resembling Tuscan columns. The pilasters are crowned by an unadorned, flat architrave that runs along the entire facade, clearly dividing the commercial first floor from the residential upper level. The second level received a more complex treatment, to emphasize its residential and, thus, social significance. The upper level facade is completely articulated around its many openings. There are 13 sets of wooden double doors with adjustable louvers, nine facing Calle Castillo and four overlooking Paseo Atocha. Each doorway is accentuated {{by a combination of}} balconies, plaster moldings and pediments, all framed by a rhythmic articulation of Corinthian pilasters. The balconies have the original 19th century wrought iron grilles. The facade is crowned with a sober, but strong entablature. The Tuscan and Corinthian pilaster accent the building verticality, against its massive and dominating horizontality.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Motion {{planning}} in high dimensional state spaces, such as for mobile manipulation, is a challenging problem. Constrained manipulation, e. g opening <b>articulated</b> objects like <b>doors</b> or drawers, is also hard since sampling {{states on the}} constrained manifold is expensive. Further, planning for such tasks requires a combination of {{planning in}} free space for reaching a desired grasp or contact location followed by planning for the constrained manipulation motion, often necessitating a slow two step process in traditional approaches. In this work, we show that combined planning for such tasks can be dramatically accelerated by providing user demonstrations of the constrained manipulation motions. In particular, we show how such demonstrations {{can be incorporated into}} a recently developed framework of planning with experience graphs which encode and reuse previous experiences. We focus on tasks involving articulation constraints, e. g. door opening or drawer opening, where the motion of the object itself involves only a single degree of freedom. We provide experimental results with the PR 2 robot opening a variety of such articulated objects using our approach, using full-body manipulation (after receiving kinesthetic demonstrations). We also provide simulated results highlighting the benefits of our approach for constrained manipulation tasks. I...|$|R
