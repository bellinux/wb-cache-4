5|$|Soul Reaver 2 {{is set in}} Nosgoth, {{a fictional}} land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, , the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore <b>the</b> <b>Pillars</b> of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which are {{inextricably}} tied {{to the health of}} the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of <b>the</b> <b>Pillars,</b> Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{told that}} Rav Joseph's wife used to kindle the Sabbath lights late (just before nightfall).

50|$|<b>The</b> {{truncated}} <b>pillar</b> now at <b>the</b> ruined {{palace of}} Feruz Shah came from Khizrabad, in the upstream {{reaches of the}} Yamuna River, about 90 km from Delhi. The transportation of <b>the</b> <b>pillar</b> was highly demanding, requiring soldiers (both cavalry and foot) to pitch in with all tools and tackles to transport it to Delhi. Silk cotton from the Silk cotton tree, the simal, was gathered in large quantities to surround <b>the</b> <b>pillar</b> before it was lowered horizontally to the ground. The covering was then removed, and replaced by reeds and raw hide to protect <b>the</b> <b>pillar.</b> A 42-wheeled cart was used to transport it to the river bank, where it was loaded onto a large boat. The cart required 8,400 men to move it, 200 to each wheel. A purpose-built palatial building was constructed out of stone and lime mortar to house <b>the</b> <b>pillar.</b> <b>The</b> square base stone was placed {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>pillar</b> before <b>the</b> task was completed.

5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 <b>the</b> <b>pillars</b> were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.|$|E

5|$|In Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, Kain is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} human noble. In the game's prologue, he is murdered by assassins, and resurrected as a vampire by Mortanius, a necromancer. He is promised both vengeance and a cure to his vampirism if he can restore the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, edifices whose state dictates {{the vitality of the}} world; the nine guardians who symbiotically represent <b>the</b> <b>Pillars</b> were corrupted prior to his birth, and must be killed before the land can recover. During his quest, he meets the ancient vampire Vorador, who influences him to forsake his former humanity and accept his vampirism, and discovers the Soul Reaver, a legendary soul-devouring sword. Using the Reaver, he tries to alter the course of Nosgoth's history to prevent the Nemesis—a tyrant king—from coming to power. Tricked by Moebius, the guardian of time, Kain succeeds in destroying the Nemesis, but the temporal paradox this triggers results in a new timeline in which vampires have been hunted to extinction; Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After systematically tracking down and killing most of the guardians, he confronts Mortanius—revealed as the guardian of death, and the orchestrator of Kain's assassination—and realizes that he himself is the final guardian, and that the cure to his curse entails his own destruction. Faced with the obligation of self-sacrifice—thereby restoring the world, but ensuring the annihilation of the vampire race—or the alternative of destroying <b>the</b> <b>Pillars</b> to rule over the world in its miasmatic state, Kain opts for the latter choice, embracing vampirism as a blessing as <b>the</b> <b>Pillars</b> collapse.|$|E

40|$|Micro-pillars of anodic {{aluminium}} oxide with nano-sized honeycomb channels along <b>the</b> <b>pillar</b> axis exhibit compressive stressstrain response with large excursions corresponding to discrete, inhomogeneous deformation events.

A simple model is proposed to describe <b>the</b> response of <b>pillars</b> under compression, which energetically, as well as kinetically, explains {{as to why the}} localized deformation always takes place at <b>the</b> <b>pillar</b> head.
