Most of <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty {{would be a very}} effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E

The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Josef Smrkovský, Oldřich Černík, and František Kriegel) who supported Dubček, and conservatives (Vasil Biľak, Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka) who adopted an anti-reformist stance.|$|E

5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E

Also included in this figure are the mean and standard deviation of <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of M ≥  3 shocks. At 0.98  days relative to the M 7.3 quake, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number was negative and smaller than the standard deviation, while <b>the</b> <b>change</b> at 0.67  days before the M 7.3 quake was also at negative but within the margins of the standard deviation.

The analysis was performed for the northern area (Fig.  2 e, f) and southern area (Fig.  2 h, i) separately, obtaining the same feature. We confirmed that the above-described result is robust, by sampling different time windows (0.10 and 0.05  days) and by noting that the general features are the same for all the cases (Fig. A 2 in Additional file 1).
