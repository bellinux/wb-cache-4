5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> bases.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> ends, and stop <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
50|$|Strand {{displacement}} assay involves <b>the</b> radiolabeling of <b>DNA</b> duplexes. Following helicase treatment, <b>the</b> single-strand <b>DNA</b> is visually detected {{as separate}} from <b>the</b> double-strand <b>DNA</b> by non-denaturing PAGE electrophoresis.

50|$|The next step, {{the strand}} {{transfer}} reaction, takes place inside the host cell nucleus and involves the critical step of inserting <b>the</b> HIV <b>DNA</b> into a selected region of <b>the</b> host <b>DNA.</b> <b>The</b> region of insertion contains a weakly conserved palindromic sequence. This strand transfer reaction is initiated as the HIV integrase catalyzes <b>the</b> HIV <b>DNA</b> 3’-hydroxyl group attack on <b>the</b> host <b>DNA.</b> <b>The</b> attack by <b>the</b> HIV <b>DNA</b> occurs on opposite strands of <b>the</b> host <b>DNA</b> in a staggered fashion, typically 4-6 base pairs apart. This reaction leads to {{separation of the}} bonds in <b>the</b> host <b>DNA</b> base pairs located between the staggered cuts, and the joining of the HIV 3’-hydroxyl groups with <b>the</b> host <b>DNA</b> 5’ phosphate ends. At this point, the newly joined viral-host DNA region unfolds.|$|R

5|$|Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA {{with two}} {{complementary}} strands, similar to <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> {{found in all}} cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses (double-stranded RNA viruses).

5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis.

Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> chain for replication, preventing <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication.

50|$|Denaturing high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (DHPLC) uses reversed-phase HPLC to interrogate SNPs. The key to DHPLC is the solid phase which has differential affinity for single and double-stranded DNA. In DHPLC, DNA fragments are denatured by heating and then allowed to reanneal. The melting temperature of <b>the</b> reannealed <b>DNA</b> fragments determines <b>the</b> {{length of time}} they are retained in the column. Using PCR, two fragments are generated; target <b>DNA</b> containing <b>the</b> SNP polymorphic site and an allele-specific DNA sequence, referred to as <b>the</b> normal <b>DNA</b> fragment. This normal fragment is identical to <b>the</b> target <b>DNA</b> except potentially at the SNP polymorphic site, which is unknown in <b>the</b> target <b>DNA.</b> <b>The</b> fragments are denatured and then allowed to gradually reanneal. The reannaled products {{are added to the}} DHPLC column. If the SNP allele in <b>the</b> target <b>DNA</b> matches <b>the</b> normal <b>DNA</b> fragment, only identical homoduplexes will form during the reannealing step. If <b>the</b> target <b>DNA</b> contains a different SNP allele than <b>the</b> normal <b>DNA</b> fragment, heteroduplexes of <b>the</b> target <b>DNA</b> and normal DNA containing a mismatched polymorphic site will form in addition to homoduplexes. The mismatched heteroduplexes will have a different melting temperature than the homoduplexes and will not be retained in the column as long. This generates a chromatograph pattern that is distinctive from the pattern that would be generated if <b>the</b> target <b>DNA</b> fragment and normal DNA fragments were identical. <b>The</b> eluted <b>DNA</b> is detected by UV absorption.|$|R

50|$|Inside the nucleus, {{the host}} protein lens epithelium-derived growth factor/p75, {{commonly}} referred to in abbreviated form as LEDGF/p75, binds to the preintegration complex and <b>the</b> host <b>DNA.</b> <b>The</b> LEDGF/p75 serves as a tethering protein (or bridge) between the preintegration complex and <b>the</b> host <b>DNA.</b> <b>The</b> sequence of binding of the LEDGF/p75, <b>the</b> host <b>DNA,</b> and <b>the</b> preintegration complex remains unclear. In one version, the LEDGF/p75 binds first to the preintegration complex and then to <b>the</b> host <b>DNA.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, LEDGF/p75 may bind first to <b>the</b> host <b>DNA</b> {{and then to the}} preintegration complex. Regardless of the sequence, it is believed that the presence of LEDGF/p75 results in the integrase dimers approaching each other to form a tetramer.|$|R

5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a label-free biosensor {{for the detection}} of single-stranded pathogen <b>DNA</b> through <b>the</b> target-enhanced gelation between gold nanowires (AuNW) and <b>the</b> primer <b>DNAs</b> branched on AuNW. <b>The</b> target <b>DNA</b> enables circularization of <b>the</b> linear <b>DNA</b> template, and <b>the</b> primer <b>DNA</b> is elongated continuously via rolling circle amplification. As a result, in the presence of <b>the</b> target <b>DNA,</b> a macroscopic hydrogel was fabricated by the entanglement of <b>the</b> elongated <b>DNA</b> with AuNWs as a scaffold fiber for effective gelation. In contrast, very small separate particles were generated in the absence of <b>the</b> target <b>DNA.</b> This label-free biosensor might be a promising tool {{for the detection of}} pathogen DNAs without any devices for further analysis. Moreover, the biosensor based on the weaving of AuNW and DNAs suggests a novel direction for the applications of AuNWs in biological engineering...|$|R
40|$|Three {{species of}} unintegrated viral DNAs {{were found in}} {{permissive}} cells infected with baboon type C virus. The major species was a 9. 0 -kilobase (kb) linear DNA that was infectious. A restriction endonuclease map of this DNA was constructed and {{oriented with respect to}} the viral RNA. <b>The</b> linear <b>DNA</b> had a 0. 6 -kb sequence repeated at each terminus. These terminal repeat sequences were required for infectivity of <b>the</b> viral <b>DNA.</b> <b>The</b> minor species of <b>the</b> unintegrated viral <b>DNAs</b> were covalently closed circles of 9. 0 and 8. 4 kb. The smaller circle was in two- to threefold excess over the larger circle. The difference appeared to be that the smaller circle lacked one of the two 0. 6 -kb repeat sequences found in the larger circle. Restriction endonuclease maps of <b>the</b> integrated viral <b>DNAs</b> were constructed, and the sequences on both viral DNA and cellular DNA that are involved in integration were determined. <b>The</b> integrated viral <b>DNA</b> map was identical to that of the unintegrated infectious 9. 0 -kb linear DNA. Therefore, a specific site in the terminal repeat sequence of <b>the</b> viral <b>DNA</b> was used to integrate with <b>the</b> host cell <b>DNA.</b> <b>The</b> sizes of <b>the</b> cellular <b>DNA</b> fragments were different from clone to clone but stable with cell passage.

5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of <b>the</b> <b>DNA,</b> and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> and the histones, making <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
