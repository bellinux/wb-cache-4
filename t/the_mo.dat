40|$|Genetic and {{molecular}} evidence {{presented in this}} paper demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>Mos</b> factor for inherited mosaicism is a special copy of the transposable element mariner. Mosaicism observed in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Mos</b> (Mosaic) factor results from a high frequency of excision of the mariner element from an insertion site near the white-eye gene in Drosophila mauritiana. <b>The</b> <b>Mos</b> factor promotes <b>the</b> excision of mariner elements from genomic insertion sites other than the site in wpch, and it also promotes its own loss from the genome. Putative transpositions of Mos to new genomic sites have also been observed. A copy of mariner present at a particular site in a Mos strain {{has been shown to be}} missing in derived strains in which <b>the</b> <b>Mos</b> factor has been lost, and in strains with putative transpositions.

5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in <b>the</b> <b>Mo</b> operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E

40|$|We {{established}} a monoclonal antibody against a surface antigen of activated macrophages (<b>Møs)</b> involved in <b>the</b> rejection of an allografted mouse tumor, Meth A. Bacteria-elicited <b>Møs</b> also expressed <b>the</b> antigen but resident or inflammatory Møs, or other leukocytes, did not. The antigen {{was identified as}} Ly- 6 C by isolation of cDNA clones encoding it. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed that Ly- 6 C of <b>the</b> <b>Møs</b> exists in multiple forms with a similar size but with different isoelectric points. A Ly- 6 C pre-mRNA also accumulated abundantly in <b>the</b> <b>Møs.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> multiple expression of Ly- 6 C and the accumulation of the pre-mRNA are the features of allograft- and bacteria-elicited Møs. q 1996 Academic Press, Inc. Macrophages (Møs) are functionally and morphologically a quite heterogeneous population (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2).

Therefore we developed an allograft model system in which Meth A tumor cells were transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of allogeneic mice (7, 9). Since Meth A cells are an ascites type, the advantage of this system {{is that we can}} obtain <b>the</b> <b>Møs</b> infiltrating into <b>the</b> rejection site simply by lavage of the peritoneal cavity (7 - 10).
