25|$|As {{the best}} and {{original}} state, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness {{in the form of}} a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere. Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of God. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.|$|E

Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings [...] "Here Come the Tears" [...] from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which {{had a profound impact on}} the sound of the band.|$|E
40|$|Ten {{studies are}} used to {{document}} that time is valued in accordance with a double-kinked value function. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> zone of indifference for small time gains (losses), increasing marginal utility (disutility) for moderate time gains (losses), and dimin-ishing marginal utility (disutility) for large time gains (losses). Moderate amounts of time exhibit increasing marginal utility (disutility) because larger blocks of <b>time</b> provide <b>a</b> more diverse set of usage opportunities. It is only when {{it is difficult to}} imagine how more (less) time would be beneficial (detrimental) that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> dimin-ishing marginal utility (disutility) for time.

500|$|Non-kosher {{birds are}} listed {{outright}} (...) but the exact zoological references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds (24 are mentioned). The Mishnah refers to four signs {{provided by the}} sages. [...] First, a dores (predatory bird) is not kosher. [...] Additionally, kosher birds possess three physical characteristics: [...] an extra toe in the back (which does not join the other toes in supporting the leg), a zefek (crop), and a korkoban (gizzard) with a peelable lumen. [...] However, individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition (masorah) is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even {{if it can be}} substantiated that they meet all four criteria. The only exception to this is turkey. [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> certain authorities considered the signs enough, so Jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses all the signs (simanim) in Hebrew.|$|E

The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.|$|E

40|$|My central {{question}} {{in this paper}} is how delusional beliefs are related to self-deception. In section 1, I summa-rize my position on what self-deception is and how representative instances of it are to be explained. I turn to delusions in section 2. 1. Self-deception According to a traditional view, self-de-ception <b>is</b> <b>an</b> intrapersonal analogue of stereotypical interpersonal deception. 1 In the latter case, deceivers intentionally de-ceive others into believing something, p, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> at which the deceivers believe that p is false while their victims falsely believe that p is true. If self-decep-tion is properly understood on this model, self-deceivers intentionally deceive them-selves into believing something, p, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> at which they believe that p is false while also believing that p is true...|$|R

500|$|Anthony Burgess, in Ninety-nine Novels, cited {{it as one}} of the 99 best {{novels in}} English since 1939. [...] "Fleming raised the {{standard}} of the popular story of espionage through good writing — a heightened journalistic style — {{and the creation of a}} government agent — James Bond, 007 — who is sufficiently complicated to compel our interest over a whole series of adventures. A patriotic lecher with a tinge of Scottish puritanism in him, a gourmand and amateur of vodka martinis, a smoker of strong tobacco who does not lose his wind, he is pitted against impossible villains, enemies of democracy, megalomaniacs. Auric Goldfinger is the most extravagant of these. All this is, in some measure, a great joke, but Fleming's passion for plausibility, his own naval intelligence background, and a kind of sincere Manicheism, allied to journalistic efficiency in the management of his recit, make his work rather impressive. The James Bond films, after From Russia With Love, stress the fantastic and are inferior entertainment to the books. It is unwise to disparage the well-made popular. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Conan Doyle was ignored by the literary annalists even though Sherlock Holmes was evidently one of the great characters of fiction. We must beware of snobbishness." ...|$|E
500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now... if ever <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now."

[...] Famous for being very [...] "press-shy" [...] and private, much like the characters she portrays on-screen, Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking interviews. In a 2017 interview with Interview magazine, the actress warned her interviewer, director Darren Aronofsky, that she is [...] "the worst interviewee that ever was"; her interviews often feature discussions about how much she dislikes being interviewed because the process makes her nervous. Pfeiffer revealed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> attending interviews to promote her films would make her very agitated and uncomfortable, but she has always [...] "mastered the art" [...] of maintaining a composed, polite demeanor when performing such responsibilities. However, she maintains that [...] "I still don't believe – and I never will – that it's the actors' responsibility to sell a film." [...] The actress resembles an [...] "intense conversationalist" [...] in her interviews, tending to scrunch her face and narrow her eyes before responding to questions.
