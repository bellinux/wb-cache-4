25|$|Amongst the {{important}} names of Arabic astrologers, {{one of the}} most influential was Albumasur, whose work Introductorium in Astronomiam later became a popular treatise in medieval Europe. Another was the Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and geographer Al Khwarizmi. The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the star names that are commonly known today, such as Aldebaran, Altair, Betelgeuse, Rigel and Vega retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic lots to the extent that they became historically known as Arabic parts, for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> known to have been an important feature of Hellenistic astrology.|$|E
25|$|Members of the MAPK {{family can}} be found in every {{eukaryotic}} organism examined so far. In particular, both classical and atypical MAP kinases {{can be traced back to}} the root of the radiation of major eukaryotic groups. Terrestrial plants contain four groups of classical MAPKs (MAPK-A, MAPK-B, MAPK-C and MAPK-D) that are involved in response to myriads of abiotic stresses. However, none of these groups can be directly equated to the clusters of classical MAPKs found in opisthokonts (fungi and animals). In the latter, the major subgroups of classical MAPKs form the ERK/Fus3-like branch (that is further sub-divided in metazoans into ERK1/2 and ERK5 subgroups), and the p38/Hog1-like kinases (that has also split into the p38 and the JNK subgroups in multicellular animals). In addition, there are several MAPKs in both fungi and animals, whose origins are less clear, either due to high divergence (e.g. NLK), or due to possibly being an early offshoot to the entire MAPK family (ERK3, ERK4, ERK7). In vertebrates, due to the twin whole genome duplications after the cephalochordate/vertebrate split, there are several paralogs in every group. Thus ERK1 and ERK2 both correspond to the Drosophila kinase rolled, JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 are all orthologous to the gene basket in Drosophila. Although among the p38 group, p38 alpha and beta are clearly paralogous pairs, and so are p38 gamma and delta in vertebrates, the timing of the base split is less clear, given that many metazoans already possess multiple p38 homologs (there are three p38-type kinases in Drosophila, Mpk2(p38a), p38b and p38c). The single ERK5 protein appears to fill a very specialized role (essential for vascular development in vertebrates) wherever it is present. This lineage has been deleted in protostomes, together with its upstream pathway components (MEKK2/3, MKK5), although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> present in cnidarians, sponges and even in certain unicellular organisms (e.g. the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis) closely related to the origins of multicellular animals.|$|E

500|$|In one {{of these}} sections, Stevens {{addressed}} the issue of whether military commissions can try conspiracy charges. He argued that military commissions are not courts of general jurisdiction, which are able to try any crime; that the court has traditionally held that offenses against the law of war are triable by military commission only when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> defined as war crimes by statute or strong common law precedent (cf.

500|$|Morchella sextelata was {{originally}} identified as phylogenetic species [...] "Mel-6" [...] in the species-rich Elata clade (brown morels) elucidated by microbiologist Kerry O'Donnell and colleagues in a 2011 publication. The specific epithet sextelata alludes to this preliminary name. Although M.sextelata is not distinguishable from Morchella septimelata on physical or ecological characteristics, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> genetically distinct species, {{and can be}} differentiated by comparing DNA sequences or with {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis. Allopatric speciation is thought to have been the driving evolutionary force that caused M.sextelata to diverge from its ancestors roughly 25 million years ago. The original specimens collected were obtained as part of the Morel Data Collection Project, a research effort designed to improve the understanding of North American morels.|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey {{was more}} positive, stating that [...] "the funniest stuff {{comes from the}} kind of {{situational}} misfires that can happen when dudes try to do things, like catch aliens, that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> not cut out to do".

Boxoffices James Rocchi offered a positive stance, stating that the [...] "plot moves, the supporting cast is lively and the action stays small-scale and intimate, never overwhelming the laughs"; he felt that the profanity and vulgarity never became [...] "stale".

[...] The gena have a distinct tooth-like structure on the lower sides.
