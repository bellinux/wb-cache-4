50|$|If {{the rise}} and fall times of the {{modulation}} pulses are zero, (e.g. the pulse edges are infinitely sharp), then the sidebands will be as shown in the spectral diagrams above. The bandwidth consumed by this transmission can be huge and the total power transmitted is distributed over many hundreds of spectral lines. This is a potential source of interference with any other device and frequency-dependent imperfections in the <b>transmit</b> <b>chain</b> mean that some of this power never arrives at the antenna. In reality of course, it is impossible to achieve such sharp edges, so in practical systems the sidebands contain far fewer lines than a perfect system. If the bandwidth can be limited to include relatively few sidebands, by rolling off the pulse edges intentionally, an efficient system can be realised with the minimum of potential for interference with nearby equipment. However, the trade-off of this is that slow edges make range resolution poor. Early radars limited the bandwidth through filtration in the <b>transmit</b> <b>chain,</b> e.g. the waveguide, scanner etc., but performance could be sporadic with unwanted signals breaking through at remote frequencies and the edges of the recovered pulse being indeterminate. Further examination of the basic Radar Spectrum shown above shows that the information in the various lobes of the Coarse Spectrum is identical to that contained in the main lobe, so limiting the transmit and receive bandwidth to that extent provides significant benefits in terms of efficiency and noise reduction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Generalized spatial {{modulation}} (GSM) is {{a relatively}} new modulation scheme for multi-antenna wireless communica-tions. It is quite attractive because of its ability to work with less number of <b>transmit</b> RF <b>chains</b> compared to traditional spatial multiplexing (V-BLAST system). In this paper, we show that, by using an optimum combination of number of transmit an-tennas (Nt) and number of <b>transmit</b> RF <b>chains</b> (Nrf), GSM can achieve better throughput and/or bit error rate (BER) than spa-tial multiplexing. First, we quantify the percentage savings in the number of <b>transmit</b> RF <b>chains</b> as well as the percentage in-crease in the rate achieved in GSM compared to spatial multi-plexing; 18. 75 % savings in number of RF chains and 9. 375 % increase in rate are possible with 16 transmit antennas and 4 -QAM modulation. A bottleneck, however, is the complexity of maximum-likelihood (ML) detection of GSM signals, particu-larly in large MIMO systems where the number of antennas is large. We address this detection complexity issue next. Specif-ically, we propose a Gibbs sampling based algorithm suited to detect GSM signals. The proposed algorithm yields impressive BER performance and complexity results. For the same spec-tral efficiency and number of <b>transmit</b> RF <b>chains,</b> GSM with the proposed detection algorithm achieves better performance than spatial multiplexing with ML detection...|$|R

Furthermore, it was also shown that the signal model is valid for various different RF cancellers. To control the complexity of the cancellation procedure, a novel principal component analysis based scheme was then proposed, which can be used to control the number of parameters in the signal model. With the help of waveform simulations, the proposed digital canceller was shown to cancel the SI nearly perfectly, even when its computational complexity was significantly reduced using principal component analysis.|$|R
40|$|Purpose A new {{framework}} {{for the design of}} parallel transmit (pTx) pulses is presented introducing constraints for local and global specific absorption rate (SAR) in the presence of errors in the radiofrequency (RF) <b>transmit</b> <b>chain.</b> Methods The first step is the design of a pTx RF pulse with explicit constraints for global and local SAR. Then, the worst possible SAR associated with that pulse due to RF transmission errors (“worst-case SAR”) is calculated. Finally, this information is used to re-calculate the pulse with lower SAR constraints, iterating this procedure until its worst-case SAR is within safety limits. Results Analysis of an actual pTx RF <b>transmit</b> <b>chain</b> revealed amplitude errors as high as 8 % (20 %) and phase errors above 3 ° (15 °) for spokes (spiral) pulses. Simulations show that using the proposed framework, pulses can be designed with controlled “worst-case SAR” in the presence of errors of this magnitude at minor cost of the excitation profile quality. Conclusion Our worst-case SAR-constrained pTx design strategy yields pulses with local and global SAR within the safety limits even in the presence of RF transmission errors. This strategy is a natural way to incorporate SAR safety factors in the design of pTx pulses. National Institutes of Health (U. S.) (R 01 EB 006847...|$|E

However, {{it has been suggested}} that channel measurements cannot be properly performed when such a short pilot symbol transmission duration is considered [31]. Transmitting pilot symbols for a longer period of time can increase the accuracy of channel quality measurements. A value of N= 10 ms is chosen, as this provides a good compromise between measurement delays, small cell energy consumption and measurement accuracy [33]. Thus, the time for a UE to detect and measure a small cell is bounded by [10 ms, 200 ms].|$|R

In traditional HetNet architectures, small cell sleep mode schemes where the <b>transmitting</b> <b>chain</b> of the small cell is completely switched off are difficult to realize, mostly due to discovery issues of the small cells in sleep mode. Indeed, if a small cell in sleep mode stops transmitting pilot symbols, UEs can neither be aware of its existence, nor obtain an estimation of the UE-small cell channels [4, 5]. Macro-assisted small cell connection establishment procedures overcome this discovery issue, since connections of UEs to small cells are systematically handled by the macro BS, which is always aware {{of the status of}} small cells connected to it via the backhaul link. The PCC architecture intrinsically supports the implementation of small cell energy savings schemes which exploit macro-assisted small cell connection procedures.|$|R
