The clip begins in medias res with Veronica, {{pretending to be a}} high schooler, talking <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher.</b> The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the teacher for sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher on camera, and at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they speak to a man who appears to be innocent. However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends.|$|E

25|$|Teaching is undervalued and underpaid as a {{profession}} and this was not helped by the selection procedure. Prior to 2010, students with lower achievement at grade 10 could go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Teacher</b> Training Institute (TTI) or a College of Teacher's Education (CTE) for a certificate or diploma. If students passed the EHEEE, education faculties took students with lower GPAs than other faculties. Teaching is hard work with high mean pupil/teacher ratios in primary schools and many operating a double shift. Many teachers lack motivation and 60% would move to another job if given the opportunity.|$|E

500|$|... {{consider}} {{a model of}} classroom scheduling [...] in which a set of n teachers must be scheduled to teach each of m cohorts of students. The number of hours per week that teacher i spends with cohort j is described by entry Rij of a matrix R given as input to the problem, and each teacher also has a set of hours during {{which he or she}} is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is NP-complete, even when each teacher has at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when each teacher only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable vij corresponds to an hour that teacher i must spend with cohort j, the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher's available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> {{at the same time as}} each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.|$|E

Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's permanent file and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it.

Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction is rife with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne.|$|E

2500|$|A {{professional}} {{colleague of}} Terman's, Leta Hollingworth {{was the first}} in the United States to study how best to serve students who showed evidence of high performance on tests. Although recognizing Terman's and Galton's beliefs that heredity played a vital role in intelligence, Hollingworth gave similar credit to home environment and school structure. Hollingworth worked to dispel the pervasive belief that [...] "bright children take care of themselves" [...] and emphasized the importance of early identification, daily contact, and grouping gifted children with others with similar abilities. Hollingworth performed an 18-year-long study of 50 children in New York City who scored 155 or above on the Stanford-Binet, and studied smaller groups of children who scored above a 180. She also ran a school in New York City for bright students that employed a curriculum of student-led exploration, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> providing students with a more advanced curriculum they would encounter later in life.|$|E

We are developing a supporting system for a dis-tant lecture named ACE (Automatic Camera control system for Education). The previous version of ACE captures the lecture focusing on the latest object writ-ten on a blackboard because <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> frequently explains it. However, <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> not always explains the latest object. We have designed, therefore, ACE <b>to</b> take <b>a</b> suitable shot according <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher’s</b> behavior.

2500|$|According to Dewey, the {{successful}} classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, {{she knows that}} her career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; {{all of which have}} the potential to overcome her genuine love and sympathy for her students. For Dewey, [...] "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher,</b> too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2101, p.35).|$|E
2500|$|In the Zohar, Rabbi Jose expounded on [...] "And let every wise-hearted man {{among you}} come and make all that the Lord has commanded."

Rabbi Jose deduced that the man of discernment (navan) is of a higher degree than the wise man (hacham), for even a pupil who gives new ideas <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> is called [...] "wise." [...] A wise man knows for himself as much as is required, but the man of discernment apprehends the whole, knowing both his {{own point of view}} and that of others. [...] uses the term [...] "wise-hearted" [...] because the heart was seen to be the seat of wisdom. Rabbi Jose taught that the man of discernment apprehends the lower world and the upper world, his own being and the being of others.|$|E
