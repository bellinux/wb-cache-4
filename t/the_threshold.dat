For EP-length configurations including the 12-inch single, <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> were lowered to Gold (250,000units) and Platinum (500,000units); previously <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> were Gold (500,000units) and Platinum (1,000,000units).

The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold.
