He inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the Chinese, recaptured Seoul in March 1951, and pushed {{on to the}} 38th Parallel. With the improved military situation, Truman now saw the opportunity to offer a negotiated peace but, on 24 March, MacArthur called upon China <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both the Chinese and his own superiors. Truman's proposed announcement was shelved.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} single {{victory of}} the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September (the Battle of Jijiga), in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were {{no match for the}} assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the Marda Pass, halfway between Jijiga and Harar. By September Ethiopia was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of Harerge, Bale, and Sidamo. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new Warsaw Pact bloc weaponry took place.|$|E
500|$|The Apology was {{a popular}} work and gave Cibber a good return. Its self-complacency, however, infuriated some of his contemporaries, notably Pope, but even the usually {{critical}} Samuel Johnson had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "very entertaining and very well done". It went through four editions in his lifetime, and more after his death, and generations of readers have found it an amusing and engaging read, projecting an author always [...] "happy in his own good opinion, {{the best of all}} others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity of age." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 19, the Iowa Republican Party {{released}} the certified results showing Santorum edged out Romney with 29,839 votes to Romney's 29,805, {{a margin of}} 34 votes. The Iowa Republican Party initially declined to formally declare a winner because results from eight precincts were lost {{and could not be}} certified, which The Washington Post said [...] "served to embarrass the Iowa GOP — which had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had misallocated some votes, and simply lost some others, in a razor's-edge election where every vote mattered." [...] One party executive called the result a [...] "split decision." [...] The initial returns from the uncertified eight precincts (four in Lee County and one each in Cerro Gordo, Emmet, Franklin, and Pocahontas counties) also favored Santorum, and statistician Nate Silver stated that if those missing precincts had been included, Santorum's margin would have been increased.|$|E

2500|$|On August 3, 1948, in {{testimony}} to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Whittaker Chambers named Witt {{as a member of}} the [...] "Ware Group." [...] When called before a one-man subcommittee of HUAC (whose sole member was Representative Richard Nixon) on August 20, Witt denied knowing [...] "J. Peters" [...] (ostensibly the head of the Soviet Union's political operations in the United States), Chambers, or Alger Hiss. [...] Along with Abt and Pressman, Witt invoked First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights when refusing to answer HUAC questions. Lee Pressman, also testifying that day, forced the subcommittee <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not accusing the men of espionage but rather being communists seeking to infiltrate the government (which was not a crime). A few weeks later, former Daily Worker editor turned anti-communist Louis F. Budenz testified that the CPUSA considered Witt a member. Federal law enforcement officials debated prosecuting Witt in late 1948—not for being a communist, a spy, or for committing espionage, but under a contempt of Congress charge for asserting his Fifth Amendment rights before the committee and refusing to answer its questions. No prosecution was ever made. Witt later testified in February 1949 before a federal grand jury investigating illegal CPUSA activities in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his great}} wealth and high position, Thomas {{could not come}} to terms with his brother's {{appointment}} as Protector; and in his struggle with Somerset, he tried to ingratiate himself with the king, who was just a little boy. He sought the 9-year-old Edward to write a letter on his behalf in support of his marriage to the dowager queen, Catherine Parr. The letter was obviously dictated by Thomas for Edward's signature and only enraged Somerset. He began to visit Edward frequently, secretly giving him an extravagant allowance of coins, so that Edward might be satisfied in feeling more grown-up and more king-like, giving gifts to his servants, teachers, and friends. Even though he lived in sumptuous splendor, and wanting for nothing, no provisions had been made for Edward's pocket money and he became accustomed to these regular payments and began to ask Thomas freely for his allowance. Thomas continued his manipulation of the king. [...] In trying to get a bill through Parliament making him Edward's personal Governor, Thomas requested Edward's royal signature on the bill. [...] But Edward was uncertain, and reluctant to go behind the back of the Protector, Somerset, and of the regency council, and he would not sign it. [...] Thomas persistently pressured Edward, until Edward felt threatened. But Thomas did not give up. He tried to persuade Edward that he did not need a Protector, getting Edward <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be better for Somerset to die. [...] It is not known what the king meant by this, but it was probably uttered innocently. Thomas intended that the king's royal signature and personal support would destabilize Somerset's position as Protector, and {{as a member of the}} regency council. In his frustration and inability to gain any significant influence over the king, Thomas began to think in terms of open rebellion. [...] Although he was a boy, King Edward did not seem completely naïve regarding any of this. [...] For, it is recorded that Edward referred to William Parr, his step-mother's brother, as [...] "mine honest uncle," [...] indicating unspoken scorn for both of his Seymour uncles..|$|E
