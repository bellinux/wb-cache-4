50|$|Consider {{a nozzle}} {{connected}} to a vacuum source. As the pressure ratio gets to about 2, the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound, and the flow becomes choked flow. When the absolute pressure of the vacuum is decreased further, the flow speed will not increase. This is the Kantrowitz Limit, which limits the mass flow because the velocity {{is limited to the}} speed of sound, and the area, inlet pressure and density are all fixed.

50|$|Volumetric {{efficiency}} (VE) in {{an internal}} combustion engine design refers to the efficiency with which the engine can move the charge of fuel and air {{into and out of}} the cylinders. Volumetric efficiency is also the ratio of air volume drawn into the cylinder to the cylinder's swept volume. More specifically, volumetric efficiency is a ratio (or percentage) of the mass of air and fuel that is trapped by the cylinder during induction divided by the mass that would occupy the displaced volume if the air density in the cylinder were equal to the ambient air density. The flow restrictions in the intake system create a pressure drop in <b>the</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> which reduces the density (unless boosts like turbos or superchargers or cam tuning techniques are used). Volumetric efficiency can be improved in a number of ways, most effectively this can be achieved by compressing the induction charge (forced induction) or by aggressive cam phasing in naturally aspirated engines as seen in racing applications. In the case of forced induction volumetric efficiency can exceed 100%.|$|E
50|$|The second {{difficulty}} {{occurs when}} the aircraft Mach number changes. The airflow {{has to be the}} same at the intake lip, at the throat and at the engine. This statement is a consequence the conservation of mass. However, the airflow is not generally the same when the aircraft's supersonic speed changes. This difficulty is known as the airflow matching problem which is solved by more complicated inlet designs than are typical of subsonic inlets. For example, to match airflow, a supersonic inlet throat can be made variable and some air can be bypassed around the engine and then pumped as secondary air by an ejector nozzle. If <b>the</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> is not match, it may become unstable with the normal shock wave in the throat suddenly moving forward beyond the lip, known as inlet unstart. Spillage drag is high and pressure recovery low with only a plane shock wave in place of the normal set of oblique shock waves. In the SR-71 installation the engine would continue to run although afterburner blowout sometimes occurred.|$|E
50|$|Rocket engines {{requires}} {{a tremendous amount}} of fuelat high pressure. Often the pump costs more than the thrust chamber. One way to supply fuel is to use the expensiveturbopump mentioned above, another way is to pressurize fueltank. Pressurizing a large fuel tank {{requires a}} heavy, expensive tank. However suppose instead of pressurizing the entire tank, the main tank is drained into a small pump chamber which is thenpressurized. To achieve steady flow, the pump system consists oftwo pump chambers such that each one supplies fuel for half of each cycle. The pump is powered by pressurized gas which acts directly on the fluid. For each half of the pump system, a chamber is filled from the main tank under low pressure and at a high flow rate, then the chamber is pressurized, and then the fluid is delivered to the engine at a moderate flow rate under high pressure. The chamber is then vented and cycle repeats. The system is designed so that <b>the</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> rate is higher than the outlet flow rate. This allows time for one chamber to be vented, refilled and pressurized while the other is being emptied. A breadboard pump has been tested and it works great. A high version has been designed and built and is pumping at 20 gpm and 550 psi.|$|E
