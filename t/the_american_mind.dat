25|$|Bloom's work is {{not easily}} categorized, {{yet there is a}} thread that links all of his {{published}} material. He was concerned with preserving a philosophical way of life for future generations. He strove to do this through both scholarly and popular writing. His writings may be placed into two categories: scholarly (e.g., Plato's Republic) and popular political commentary (e.g., The Closing of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Mind).</b> On the surface, this is a valid distinction, yet closer examinations of Bloom’s works reveal a direct connection between the two types of expression, which reflect his view of philosophy {{and the role of the}} philosopher in political life.|$|E

500|$|After high school, Keyes {{attended}} Cornell University, {{where he}} was a member of the Cornell University Glee Club and The Hangovers. He studied political philosophy with American philosopher and essayist Allan Bloom and has said that Bloom was the professor who influenced him most in his undergraduate studies. Keyes has stated that he received death threats for opposing Vietnam war protesters who seized a campus building. Keyes has stated that a passage of Bloom's book, The Closing of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Mind,</b> refers to this incident, speaking of an African-American student [...] "whose life had been threatened by a black faculty member when the student refused to participate in a demonstration" [...] at Cornell. Shortly thereafter, he left the school and spent a year in Paris under a Cornell study abroad program connected with Bloom.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} failure of the court-packing plan, President Roosevelt {{obtained}} his first opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court Justice when conservative Willis Van Devanter retired. Roosevelt wanted the replacement to be a [...] "thumping, evangelical New Dealer" [...] who was reasonably young, confirmable by the Senate, and from a region of the country unrepresented on the Court. The three final candidates were Solicitor General Stanley Reed, Sherman Minton, and Hugo Black. Roosevelt said Reed [...] "had no fire," [...] and Minton did not want the appointment at the time. The position would go to Black, a candidate from the South, who, as a senator, had voted for all 24 of Roosevelt's major New Deal programs. Roosevelt admired Black's use of the investigative role of the Senate to shape <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>mind</b> on reforms, his strong voting record, and his early support, which dated back to 1933. Both Reed and Minton were later appointed to the Supreme Court; Reed was the next Justice appointed by Roosevelt, while Minton was appointed by Harry Truman in 1949.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the Gingrey/Limbaugh {{incident}} House Republicans {{had vowed}} {{to cooperate with}} Democrats on drafting the economic stimulus package. One day after Gingrey was forced to apologize to Limbaugh a vote was taken on the stimulus package, with all 177 House Republicans voting against it. This prompted some to speculate that Limbaugh's castigation of Republican leaders, and subsequent cowing of Gingrey had put the fear of a potential Limbaugh-led conservative revolt against Republicans into the Representatives, causing them to withdraw any support for the package. Observers painted this as a dramatic demonstration of Limbaugh's influence on both the Republican base and <b>the</b> conservative <b>American</b> <b>mind</b> set.|$|R

2500|$|Bloom's The Closing of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Mind</b> is a {{critique}} of the contemporary university and how Bloom sees it as failing its students. [...] In it, Bloom criticizes the modern movements in philosophy and the humanities. [...] Philosophy professors involved in ordinary language analysis or logical positivism disregard important [...] "humanizing" [...] ethical and political issues and fail to pique the interest of students. [...] Literature professors involved in deconstructionism promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with them. [...] To a great extent, Bloom's criticism revolves around his belief that the [...] "great books" [...] of Western thought have been devalued as a source of wisdom. Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society. The Closing of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Mind</b> draws analogies between the United States and the Weimar Republic. The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the Enlightenment thought of John Locke—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Allan David Bloom (September 14, 1930 [...] October 7, 1992) was an American philosopher, classicist, and academician. He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojève. He {{subsequently}} {{taught at}} Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, École Normale Supérieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed {{the idea of}} Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, The Closing of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Mind.</b> Characterized as a conservative in the popular media, Bloom denied {{that he was a}} conservative, and asserted that what he sought to defend was the 'theoretical life'. Saul Bellow wrote Ravelstein, a roman à clef based on Bloom, his friend and colleague at the University of Chicago.|$|E
2500|$|The Closing of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Mind</b> was {{published}} in 1987, five years after Bloom published an essay in National Review about the failure of universities to {{serve the needs of}} students. With the encouragement of Saul Bellow, his colleague at the University of Chicago, he expanded his thoughts into a book [...] "about a life I've led", that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher’s modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews, including one by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in the New York Times and an op-ed piece by syndicated conservative commentator George Will titled, [...] "A How-To Book for the Independent" [...] it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list for four months.|$|E
