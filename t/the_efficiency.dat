5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases <b>the</b> <b>efficiency</b> of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, <b>the</b> <b>efficiency</b> would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>efficiency</b> is {{proportional}} to Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase <b>the</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
