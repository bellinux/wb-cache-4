A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E
25|$|In {{determining}} {{the feasibility of}} extraterrestrial life, astronomers had long focused their attention on stars like the Sun. However, since planetary systems that resemble the Solar System are proving to be rare, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> explore the possibility that life might form in systems very unlike our own.|$|E

25|$|However {{insufficient}} estradiol and progesterone {{are produced}} to induce maturation of an egg and ovulation. Although prepubertal ovaries are inactive enough that no lipid accumulates to cause damage, once <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> produce estrogen, lipid damage begins to accrue {{and the ability}} to produce estrogen, as well as ovulate, is slowly degraded. Cysts also form in the ovaries. Women with lipoid CAH have been infertile presumably due to anovulation.|$|E

For many decades, a leading source of income for the Wyandot of Quebec has been selling pottery, traditional-pattern snowshoes, summer and winter moccasins and other locally produced crafts.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} exports under global demand for wood, Honduras has cut down forest at an increasing rate and by 1996, annual deforestation was at 108,000 ha. About 170,000 ha of land in Honduras are subject to soil erosion. Without forest in place, rains have eroded large areas of land and rivers are carrying valuable topsoil downstream. Where dams are built, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> silt up with the possible effect of reducing their hydroelectric potential.|$|E

25|$|Established in 1908, Toulon {{currently}} {{play their}} home {{games at the}} Stade Mayol, although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> take high-profile matches to the 60,000-seat Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, playing one match there in 2008–09 and two in both 2009–10 and 2010–11. The club colours are red and black. Toulon were Pro D2 champions in 2005, but after finishing 14th in the 2005-06 Top 14 season, they were relegated back down. After signing a number of high-profile players, the club made a strong run at promotion in the 2006–07 season, and succeeded in their promotion quest in 2007–08, winning that season's Pro D2 crown with two rounds to spare. They struggled to avoid relegation {{for much of the}} 2008–09 Top 14 season, but a late-season surge brought them to ninth place and safety.|$|E
25|$|Three {{improvements}} to card security {{have been introduced}} to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant smart cards which are intended to make forgery more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit card security code (CSC) is now present {{on the back of}} most cards, for use in card not present transactions. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the Secure POS Vendor Alliance.|$|E

2500|$|The term Hispanic as an ethnonym {{emerged in}} the 20th century, {{with the rise of}} {{migration}} of laborers from Spanish-speaking countries of the western hemisphere to the United States. It includes people who may have been considered racially distinct (Black, White, Amerindian or other mixed groups) in their home countries. Today, the word [...] "Latino" [...] is often used as a synonym for [...] "Hispanic". Even if such categories were earlier understood as racial categories, today <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> represent ethno-linguistic categories (regardless of perceived race). Similarly, [...] "Anglo" [...] is now used among many Hispanics to refer to non-Hispanic White Americans or European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not of primarily English descent.|$|E
2500|$|Five colours {{have been}} {{recognized}} since {{the earliest days of}} heraldry. [...] These are: gules, or red; sable, or black; azure, or blue; vert, or green; and purpure, or purple. [...] Two more were eventually acknowledged by most heraldic authorities: sanguine or murrey, a dark red or mulberry colour, and tenné, an orange or dark yellow to brownish colour. [...] These were termed [...] "stains" [...] by some of the more influential heraldic writers, and supposed to represent some sort of dishonour {{on the part of the}} bearer; but in fact there is no evidence that they were ever so employed, and they probably originated as mere variations of existing colours. [...] Nevertheless, the belief that they represented stains upon the honour of an armiger served to prevent them receiving widespread use, and it is only in recent times that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> appear on a regular basis.|$|E
