5|$|Reduce {{proteolytic}} susceptibility. The rate {{at which}} proteins are broken down can have a large impact on their activity in cells. Since <b>termini</b> are often accessible to proteases, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible <b>termini</b> can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{stopping}} {{patterns on}} the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line have generally been determined by several different <b>termini.</b> The steam era saw these <b>termini</b> change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had {{been added to the}} list of <b>termini,</b> with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the <b>termini</b> to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new <b>termini</b> elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E

In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display.

50|$|<b>Terminus</b> post quem ("limit after which", often {{abbreviated}} to TPQ) and <b>terminus</b> ante quem ("limit before which") specify the known limits of dating for events.
