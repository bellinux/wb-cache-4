5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; researchers found <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is {{hit by a}} neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E

The second was <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was spread upon a nuptial bed, it ensured fertility. The third was that it brought herring into the loch.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> moves they are carried with it and become flexed {{over the back of the}} insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E
5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone new light on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. The story was criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> works, the story was worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E
5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage of this is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which {{makes it easy to}} turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E

5|$|When at rest, {{the wings}} are held {{over the back}} in most insects, which may involve {{longitudinal}} folding of the wing membrane and sometimes also transverse folding. Folding may sometimes occur along the flexion lines. Though fold lines may be transverse, as in the hindwings of beetles and earwigs, they are normally radial {{to the base of}} the wing, allowing adjacent sections of a wing to be folded over or under each other. The commonest fold line is the jugal fold, situated just behind the third anal vein, although, most Neoptera have a jugal fold just behind vein 3A on the forewings. It is sometimes also present on the hindwings. Where the anal area of the hindwing is large, as in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the whole of this part may be folded under the anterior part of the wing along a vannal fold a little posterior to the claval furrow. In addition, in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the anal area is folded like a fan along the veins, the anal veins being convex, at the crests of the folds, and the accessory veins concave. Whereas the claval furrow and jugal fold are probably homologous in different species, the vannal fold varies in position in different taxa. Folding is produced by a muscle arising on the pleuron and inserted into the third axillary sclerite in such a way <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> contracts, the sclerite pivots about its points of articulation with the posterior notal process and the second axillary sclerite.|$|E
