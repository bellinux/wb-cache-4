5|$|Though not {{the first}} of its kind, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six started a popular trend of {{tactical}} first-person shooters in 1998. It featured a team-based, realistic design and themes based around counter-terrorism, requiring missions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned</b> before execution and in it, a single hit was sometimes enough to kill a character. Medal of Honor, released in 1999, started a long running proliferation of first-person shooters set during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned</b> well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{was fought}} over three days between 3 and 5 January 1941, {{as part of}} Operation Compass, the first {{military}} operation of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. It was the first battle {{of the war in}} which an Australian Army formation took part, the first to be commanded by an Australian general and the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned</b> by an Australian staff. Major General Iven Mackay's 6th Division assaulted the strongly held Italian fortress of Bardia, Libya, assisted by air support and naval gunfire, and under the cover of an artillery barrage. The 16th Infantry Brigade attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to be weak. Sappers blew gaps in the barbed wire with Bangalore torpedoes and filled in and broke down the sides of the anti-tank ditch with picks and shovels. This allowed the infantry and 23 Matilda II tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment to enter the fortress and capture all their objectives, along with 8,000 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned</b> so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} work on Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii, Masahiro Sakurai {{was taken}} out for a meal by Nintendo's then-CEO Satoru Iwata in July 2008. During their meal, Iwata asked Sakurai to develop a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was still in early development at the time, with Sakurai being the first external staff member to learn of its existence. On his way home, Sakurai was faced with both ideas and problems: Sora Ltd., which had developed Super Smash Bros. Brawl, had been drastically reduced in size {{as most of the}} game's staff had been either from other Nintendo teams or outsourced. While he had the option to creating an easy-to-develop port for the system, Sakurai decided to create a game around the third-person shooter genre, which was unpopular in Japan yet seemed suited to the planned 3D effects of the 3DS. At this point, the project was still an original game. In later conversations with Iwata, Sakurai decided to use an existing Nintendo IP as the game's basis. This was inspired by feedback received from players of Super Smash Bros. Brawl that many members of its character roster had not been in an original game for some time. After a positive response from Iwata at the suggestion, Sakurai ran through the possible franchises and decided to use Kid Icarus due to its long absence from the gaming market and continued popularity in the West. He also decided upon him due to his involvement with the character through Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Once he had chosen a possible series, he conceived the basic sequence of five-minute aerial segments, ground-based combat and bosses at the end of chapters. After submitting his plan, Sakurai was given the go-ahead to develop the game. One of the other franchises under consideration by Sakurai for use in the game was Star Fox, but he felt that there were some restrictions in implementing the planned gameplay features within the Star Fox setting. Uprising was the first Kid Icarus game to be developed since the Western-exclusive 1991 Game Boy title , and the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned</b> for Japan since the original Kid Icarus in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned</b> with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

25|$|The {{passing of}} the Urban Transport Act 1980, based on the {{recommendations}} of the Carter Report from 1970, stripped municipal authorities such as the Christchurch Transport Board of their authority to levy rates within their districts. Responsibility for funding public transport was bestowed upon regional authorities – in the Board's case, the Canterbury United (later Regional) Council — in keeping with the view that transport needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned</b> and managed in a co-ordinated way on a regional basis, though this change did not actually take effect until 1 April 1988.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{heritage}} of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, {{oil and gas}} extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, climate change, fire, and invasive species.

After two days of intense fighting that left hundreds of dead the rebels retreated on February 3 calling for reinforcements. These were intercepted and defeated by Déby's Sudanese ally, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), thus forcing the rebels to give up for good and moved to Mongo in central Chad to regroup.|$|E
25|$|Edwards {{began his}} Parliamentary career by moving a motion {{calling for the}} {{location}} of industry <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned,</b> in which he called for an area of 40 miles around London to be closed to new industry. He was concerned about a government proposal to help the {{iron and steel industry}} in Jarrow, arguing that it would become a competitor to his own constituency. In April 1937 he opposed the Conservative government's proposal for assistance to 'special areas', complaining that it had the deliberate intention of depriving Middlesbrough of the advantages other areas were to have. He made a failed attempt to get Middlesbrough included during the passage of the Bill, in which he was joined by the Middlesbrough West MP Frank Kingsley Griffith.|$|E
25|$|In June 1819, modern {{founder of}} Singapore, Thomas Stamford Raffles {{instructed}} the first Resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, to reserve the whole space within the Old Lines and the Singapore River (i.e. the northern bank) for public purposes. However, Farquhar found it expedient to allow European merchants to encroach the reserved space as this {{appeared to be}} the only suitable site for mercantile firms and godowns, since the southern bank was then too swampy. Farquhar also built a temporary home with an attap roof and kajang walls on the current Singapore Cricket Club site, on the edge which {{came to be known as}} Raffles Plain. When Raffles returned to the island in October 1822, Raffles disapproved of the encroaching by mercantile interests of land he had set aside for public use. Raffles immediately countermanded Farquhar's permits, put a stay on all buildings in the area and appointed a committee with strict and explicit instructions on how he wanted the town of Singapore <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>planned.</b> As the Esplanade plan had been broken, it was necessary to designate a new site for the town's public buildings. The area chosen was the Padang Besar or simply the Padang, as it is known today.|$|E
