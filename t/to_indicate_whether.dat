5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E

The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} notes, {{the shapes of}} the rest symbols in mensural {{notation}} are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced {{in the course of the}} period of mensural notation). The rest symbols of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the longa rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the longa was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three longa rests combined. If several longa rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> they were supposed to be grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.|$|E

25|$|Applied seals, by contrast, were {{originally}} used to seal a document closed: {{that is to}} say, the document would be folded and the seal applied {{in such a way}} that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of the page, and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no need to break them, and this use continues.|$|E

They use four 2-satisfiability variables for each square that might be part of the given shape, one <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>whether</b> it belongs to each of four possible [...] "corner regions" [...] of the shape, and they use constraints that force these regions to be disjoint, to have the desired shapes, to form an overall shape with contiguous rows and columns, and to have the desired row and column sums.

40|$|On the accentual {{value of}} Lithuanian nominal suffixes Summary This paper {{presents}} some {{remarks on the}} definition of accentual value of Lithuanian nominal suffixes. All of these suffixes determine the accentuation of derivatives and, therefore, these morphemes {{can be considered as}} dominant. It is argued in this paper that the classification of nominal suffixes into strengthening and weakening ones should be based on the effect these suffixes make on the stems of the derivatives rather than on the stems of the base words. One should note that the weakening suffixes can be not only weak, but also strong in some cases. The description of strong suffixes should not be limited <b>to</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>whether</b> they are acute or non-acute. If the vocal phonemes of the suffix belong to two syllables, the place of the stress also has to be taken into account. In a number of cases the accentual properties of suffixes are conditional (i. e. when the derivatives of these suffixes are described, additional rules have to be provided or at least the irregular items have to be listed). On the other hand, one should note that the majority of suffixes are unconditional (the accentuation of their derivatives is not related to certain conditions) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Balance and {{postural}} stability {{are crucial}} elements in daily {{activities and the}} training of athletes. Volleyball requires the athlete {{to be capable of}} regaining balance after jumping and landing. Gymnastics requires the athlete to have focus on multiple aspects of balance during the execution of a skill. Current literature has examined age, comparison of certain sports to other sports, and children in athletics, all with regards to postural stability. Current literature has shown that there is a correlation between balance training and increase of performance and decrease in injuries (Oliver & Di Brezzo, 2009). This research assessed the balance systems of athletes to determine if there is a relationship between two types of sports and balance function. The comparison of athletes <b>to</b> non-athletes <b>indicated</b> <b>whether</b> athletes have greater postural stability, the comparison of gymnasts <b>to</b> volleyball players <b>indicated</b> <b>whether</b> gymnasts have increased postural stability over volleyball players. A videonystagmography (VNG) and posturography assessment were used to evaluate postural stability. The VNG examines eye movement to check for possible vestibular dysfunction. The posturography assessment measures the participant’s center of pressure in five conditions, eyes open and closed on a rigid surface, eyes open and closed on a compliant surface, and limits of stability. Twenty participants, 6 gymnasts, 6 volleyball players and 8 non-athletes, were tested using the VNG and posturography equipment. There is insignificant statistical difference of postural stability between gymnasts, volleyball players and non-athletes...|$|R
