5|$|Hamilton assumed {{control in}} the War department, and the rift between Adams' and Hamilton's {{supporters}} widened. Many sought to vest Hamilton with command authority over the army, and they also resisted giving prominent Democratic-Republicans positions in the army, which Adams wanted {{to do in order}} to gain bipartisan support. By building a large standing army, Hamilton's supporters raised popular alarms and played into the hands of the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> the entire nation in the face of war with France. Overall, however, patriotic sentiments and a series of naval victories, popularized the war as well as the president.|$|E

However, Douglas was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> various notes on Manx dance into a form fit to be {{presented}} to the Society. Through the assistance of teachers and pupils at Albert Road School in Ramsey, Douglas was able to have three of these reconstructed dances performed: 'The Manx Dirk Dance', 'Hyndaa yn Bwoailley' and 'Eunyssagh Vona'.|$|E

At the same time, Kong Le demanded Souvanna Phouma assume {{the post of}} Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Phoumi was flown by Thao Ma to Savannakhet to establish a headquarters there <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> a resistance movement. On 14 August, 21 members of the deposed administration joined him there. On 16 August, pro-Phoumi propaganda leaflets were airdropped on Vientiane, promising Phoumi's return. However, in Vientiane on 17 August, the National Assembly, while held captive by Kong Le's forces, formed a new Royal Lao Government, naming Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister. Souvanna subsequently appointed General Ouane {{as commander in chief}} of the RLA.|$|E
500|$|After the BNP's poor {{performance}} at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall's leadership grew. His position was damaged {{by a lack of}} financial transparency in the party, with concerns being raised that large donations to the party had been used instead by Tyndall for personal expenses. The modernisers challenged his control of the party, resulting in its first ever leadership election, held in October 1999. Tyndall was challenged by Nick Griffin, who offered an improved administration, financial transparency, and greater support for local branches. 80% of party members voted, with two-thirds backing Griffin; Tyndall had secured only 411 votes, representing 30% of the total membership. Tyndall accepted his defeat with equanimity and stood down as chairman. He stated that he would become [...] "an ordinary member", telling his supporters that [...] "we have all got <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> in the greater cause of race and nation".|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Andrade was {{refining}} {{his theory of}} music. [...] He attempted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> his research into a general theory. [...] Concerned as always with Modernismo's need to break from the past, he formulated {{a distinction between the}} classical music of 18th- and 19th-century Europe, and what he called the music of the future, which would be based simultaneously on modernist breakdowns of musical form and on an understanding of folk and popular music. [...] The music of the past, he said, was conceived in terms of space: whether counterpoint, with its multiple voices arranged in vertical alignment, or the symphonic forms, in which the dominant voice is typically projected on top of a complex accompaniment. [...] Future music would be arranged in time rather than space: [...] "moment by moment" [...] (in Luper's translation). [...] This temporal music would be inspired not by [...] "contemplative remembrance", but by the deep longing or desire expressed by the Portuguese word saudade.|$|E

500|$|The episode's humour {{was praised}} by the {{majority}} of commentators. Julia Raeside, writing for The Guardian, said the writers [...] "managed <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> a loving tribute to [...] cult horror source material with an all-out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with", claiming that [...] "they get the look and tone just right and then inject it with the kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture the fictional world without deflating it". Similarly, Debnath felt that the jokes, including [...] "anachronistic references" [...] and [...] "dark punnery", were [...] "bang on". By contrast, Hawksley claimed that the episode had several [...] "inspired moments", including a [...] "perfectly pitched" [...] joke about selfies, but that the writers had failed to properly exploit the 17th-century setting. Overall, though finding it [...] "occasionally funny", Hawksley thought the episode [...] "fell some way short of what we have come to expect from Pemberton and Shearsmith". For the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the episode was [...] "all the more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight", but he noted that the character of Sir Andrew Pike allowed [...] "some offbeat humour". Chater called the episode [...] "very, very funny", and Philip Cunnington, of the Lancashire Evening Post, called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of TV so far this year" [...] after the conclusion of the series.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that [...] "as Chuck began laying out {{his plan to}} be freelance spies, and as Morgan took out the Intersect sunglasses General Beckman had so thoughtfully hidden in Chuck's going-away box, all I could feel was gratitude: I'm so glad NBC ordered one more season, because that is a show I want to see!" [...] Sepinwall praised Timothy Dalton's ability to deliver both a comic and serious performance, writing that, while on other series Volkoff's back-story [...] "would be an incredibly dark, tragic storyline", Dalton acted well enough that his emotions were not overwhelming. Sepinwall continued that the storyline [...] "would have sucked every last bit of joy out of the episode" [...] if the character had been portrayed by another Chuck actor. In contrast, Sepinwall wrote that he felt no empathy for Volkoff's daughter, as [...] "Lauren Cohan has never managed to make a cohesive and interesting character out {{of a bunch of}} jarring personality shifts". Brody Gibson of Boom Tron wrote," [...] The writers of Chuck sure know how <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> a great finale. I was floored." [...] Gibson agreed with Sepinwall on Timothy Dalton's range of acting skills, praising Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski as well. Gibson wrote that Levi deserved an Emmy nomination for a scene in which Chuck surrenders himself to Vivian to plead for the antidote to save Sarah's life. Gibson also praised Levi and Strahovski's performance in Chuck and Sarah's [...] "practice wedding": [...] "These two have always had such great chemistry, you could swear they're actually in love and not just actors pretending." ...|$|E

[...] Decolonising the Mind is split into four essays: [...] "The Language of African Literature," [...] "The Language of African Theatre," [...] "The Language of African Fiction," [...] and [...] "The Quest for Relevance." [...] Several of the book's chapters originated as lectures, and apparently this format gave Ngũgĩ [...] "the chance <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> in a connected and coherent form the main issues on the language question in literature...." [...] The book offers a distinctly anti-imperialist perspective on the [...] "continuing debate...about the destiny of Africa" [...] and language's role in both combatting and perpetrating imperialism and the conditions of neocolonialism in African nations. The book is also Ngũgĩ's [...] "farewell to English," [...] and it addresses the [...] "language problem" [...] for African authors. Ngũgĩ focuses on questions about the African writer's linguistic medium (should one write in one's indigenous language, or a hegemonic language like French or English?), the writer's intended audience, and the writer's purpose in writing.|$|E
2500|$|The Watts and Mitchell {{families}} have been central to many notable EastEnders storylines, the show having been dominated by the Watts in the 1980s, with the 1990s focusing on the Mitchells. The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female Slater clan, before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, EastEnders has largely been dominated by the Mitchell and Branning families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters. The Beales are the show's longest running family, having been in EastEnders since it began in 1985. Key {{people involved in the}} production of EastEnders have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme. Peggy Mitchell, in particular, is notorious for her ceaseless repetition of such statements as [...] "You're a Mitchell!" [...] and [...] "It's all about family!" [...] Pauline Fowler is also known for her insistence on family and mentioning her brother and husband to instill loyalty from family members. Her mother Lou Beale is renowned for her family meetings and traditional approach to family. More recently, Derek Branning regularly expresses the importance of a strong family unit. As the eldest sibling, he is constantly asserting his position as head of his family and reminding everyone <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> in times of trouble. Additionally, Derek commonly refers to himself, Max Branning and Jack Branning as [...] "the Branning brothers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Various transformations were {{effected}} for {{the relatives}} of the Corsini pope in the Palazzo Riario alla Lungara, which had been modified for Christina, queen of Sweden in the previous century but became now the Palazzo Corsini alla Lungara, purchased on 27 July 1736 by Don Neri and Don Bartolomeo Corsini, for 70 thousand scudi from [...] Duke Riario. [...] After Christina's death in 1689, her sculpture gallery and her library were emptied. Fuga was called in <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together</b> the 15th and 16th-century amenagements for the Corsini brothers, works which took from 1736 to 1758 before all was finally completed. The Corsini retained Christina's bedroom {{just as she had}} left it, and the [...] "urban" [...] front in piazza Fiammetta had to be left untouched, but the weight of her library had produced cracks in the vaulting below it, and repairs to the existing structure were not finished until 1738 (Holste). Fuga worked on the garden front of the palazzo, beginning with work on the library wing for Neri Corsini. In 1751-53 he added an identical central block containing a theatrical divided staircase, lit with large windows that looked onto the garden parterres, which had been modified and brought up to date in 1741. Then the two were linked with a ground-floor portico. In the interiors, fuga managed in innovative ways to maintain a separation of the functional service circulation from the suites of parade rooms.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} raw muscle power needed for tug of war, {{it is also}} a {{technical}} sport. The cooperation or [...] "rhythm" [...] of team members play an equally important role in victory, if not more, than their physical strength. To achieve this, a person called a [...] "driver" [...] is used to harmonize the team's joint traction power. He moves up and down next to his team pulling on the rope, giving orders to them when to pull and when to rest (called [...] "hanging"). If he spots the opponents trying to pull his team away, he gives a [...] "hang" [...] command, each member will dig into the grass with his/her boots and movement of the rope is limited. When the opponents are played out, he shouts [...] "pull" [...] and rhythmically waves his hat or handkerchief for his team <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>together.</b> Slowly but surely, the other team is forced into surrender by a runaway pull. Another factor that affects the game that is little known are the players' weights. The heavier someone is, the more static friction their feet have to the ground, and if there isn't enough friction and they weigh too little, even if he/she is pulling extremely hard, the force won't go into the rope. Their feet will simply slide along the ground if their opponent(s) have better static friction with the ground. In general, as long as one team has enough static friction and can pull hard enough to overcome the static friction of their opponent(s), that team can easily win the match.|$|E

The sense of an unnatural symbolism always settled back on him again. Each figure seemed to be, somehow, on the borderland of things, just as their theory was on the borderland of thought. He knew that each one of these men stood at the extreme end, so to speak, of some wild road of reasoning. He could only fancy, as in some old-world fable, that if a man went westward {{to the end of the}} world he would find something--say a tree--that was more or less than a tree, a tree possessed by a spirit; and that if he went east to the end of the world he would find something else that was not wholly itself--a tower, perhaps, of which the very shape was wicked. So these figures seemed to stand up, violent and unaccountable, against an ultimate horizon, visions from the verge. The ends of the earth were closing in.|$|E
