5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the {{deregulation of the}} market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Two {{members of}} the group, Beyoncé and Rowland each {{released}} one album, while Michelle Williams released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyoncé's had been regarded as the most successful {{with the release of}} Dangerously in Love (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fifth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> that their affinity to each other kept them together.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, the activist announces that the kulaks will be exterminated as a class, {{and then their}} bodies will be sent down the river on a {{makeshift}} raft. Many peasants were expecting this <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> stopped taking care of themselves long ago. One woman, for instance, is alive only to the pain she feels when stray dogs chew on her feet. Others rip their plants {{out of the ground}} by the roots, refusing to let their property be taken into collectivization. The rest of the peasants spend the night involuntarily vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen {{is unusual}} {{in terms of its}} return to ground state: it can take three {{quarters}} of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> eventually even green light emissions are prevented.|$|E
25|$|General Zhao Ponu (趙破奴) {{was sent}} on an {{expedition}} in 108 BC to invade Jushi (Turfan), a critical {{economic and military}} stronghold of the Xiongnu in the Western Regions. After he conquered the region, the Han forces repelled all Xiongnu attacks to regain control over Jushi. When King Angui acceded the throne of Loulan, the kingdom—which was the eastern-most state of the Western Regions—became increasingly apprehensive towards the Han. Their policies became somewhat anti-Han in nature and supportive towards the Xiongnu, such as allowing the killing of passing Han envoys <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> revealing Han military logistics. In 77 BC, King Angui received the Han emissary Fu Jiezi and held a banquet for the envoy, who came {{under the guise of}} bringing many coveted gifts. During the banquet, Fu Jiezi requested a private discussion with King Angui, which was a pretense for the assassination of the Loulan ruler by two of Fu Jiezi's officers. Amid the cries of horror, Fu Jiezi proclaimed an admonition to the Loulan aristocracy and beheaded the dead king. The Han court informed Weituqi—who was an ally of the Han—of his brother's death, had him escorted back from Chang'an to Loulan, and installed him as the new monarch of the kingdom, which was renamed Shanshan. Thereafter, the royal seat was relocated to the southern parts of Shanshan (present-day Kargilik or Ruoqiang), outside the sphere of Xiongnu influence.|$|E

500|$|The band took a {{different}} method in writing new material for The Hunting Party as opposed to their previous albums. While for all their previous albums they used the traditional method of writing, demoing and rerecording in the studio, songs were instead written and composed in the studio itself, with no material being written or composed beforehand. Delson spoke about the methods used on the album {{in an interview with}} Premier Guitar, saying that [...] "Something unintentional might be the coolest sound I make all day, and knowing how to allow those mistakes <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> to shape them potentially makes for some great music." ...|$|E

Philip Ellwood of Entertainment Focus praised the song's chorus, in addition to Ewen's vocal performance. He also wrote that the end result is [...] "a monster hit waiting <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> a single that is better than it has any right to be". Oikotimes.com commended the song as [...] "instantly catchy and memorable". Vicki Lutas of BBC described [...] "My Man" [...] as [...] "sexy, strong and ferocious".

Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, and if I had any inclination it was happening, I would be telling everybody 'cause I don't really give a sh-t.
