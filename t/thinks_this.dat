Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{arrives and}} reveals that Barry's frontal cortex was damaged {{when he was}} shot in the head in 1982; she <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> injury has made Barry a psychopathic {{pathological}} liar. Mulder talks to Barry, who claims that the aliens performed painful tests on him and put tracking devices in his body. Mulder—against Agent Kazdin's orders—tells Barry that he believes his story, convincing him to let two more hostages go. However, when Mulder questions whether Barry is lying, he becomes enraged. Mulder tricks Barry into approaching the front door where Barry is shot by a sniper.|$|E
5|$|The gangsters {{have bought}} a weapon off the Brotherhood {{which can help}} them fight against Inhumans. They open the box {{containing}} the weapon, and unleash a mystical being who turns the gangsters berserk. She secretly infects May as well, as the strike force takes out the gangsters. Johnson meets with Rodriguez, who stole medication from S.H.I.E.L.D. during their brief check with her which can help Johnson heal—her recent over use of her Inhuman abilities as Quake has been fracturing her bones. Johnson then tracks down the Ghost Rider and confronts it, but it defeats her, explaining that it only murders people that deserve to die. She <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> should include her, but it refuses to kill her. She later sees the Ghost Rider's human form, Robbie Reyes, looking after his disabled brother Gabe.|$|E

25|$|After {{her death}} on the pyre, the woman is finally {{transformed}} {{into the shape of}} the satimata, an spiritual embodiment of goodness, with her principal concern of being a family protector. Typically, the satimata occurs in the dreams of the family members, teaching for example, the women how to be good pativratas, herself through her sacrifice having proved she was the perfect pativrata. However, although the satimata's intentions are always {{for the good of the}} family, she is not averse to let, for example, children become sick, or the cows' udders wither, if she <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who had neglected her duties as pativrata.|$|E
25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another sense. He <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> position was what John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I {{will argue that the}} Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E
25|$|However, Ah Jie and Kai Qi's {{happiness}} is short lived {{when her father}} {{is part of a}} gang that kidnaps Ah Jie's brother for ransom. Kai Qi knowing her father is one of the cohorts protects him from the police by withholding information about the kidnappers identities when she <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> will cause her to lose her new-found happiness with Ah Jie. Soon Ah Jie's brother is found badly injured in a comatose state, the authorities show Ah Jie's family that Kai Qi's father is one of the kidnappers. Ah Jie becomes furious with Kai Qi and blames her for not telling the authorities earlier as it might have saved his brother from serious injuries. Due to her father's actions Kai Qi is too ashamed to face others and starts to revert to her isolated self, but once Ah Jie's anger cools down he tries hard to overlook what her father has done to save their relationship.|$|E

25|$|In Gaul, {{the effects}} were {{somewhat}} more significant. Hughes argues that their assistance at the Catalaunian Plains led the Goths {{to destroy the}} Alans and besiege Orleans, believing {{that they had not}} been adequately rewarded for their service. In turn, this led to further concessions to the Goths from Aetius after Thorismund's assassination by his brother, who was amicable to the Romans. He <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> may have been {{the point at which the}} Goths gained the same status of an independent kingdom that Gaiseric had. On the other hand, Kim argues that the Battle led to the decline of Roman influence in north Gaul, and strengthened the position of the Salian Franks and the Burgundians. He argues that it ultimately led to the victory of Childeric and the Franks over the Goths, the Roman comes Paul who had replaced Aegidius, and Odoacer, who return to the Danube. This set the Franks up for dominance in Gaul and put Odoacer back in power as king of the Scirii. This would ultimately lead to his service during the final years of the Western Roman Empire and his establishment of a Kingdom of Italy.|$|E

[...] Arkoff noted that [...] "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture. Michael really brought out the balls in him. I was surprised how terrifying Vincent was in that... I hadn't expected it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title page}} of the {{collection}} Cathay (1915), refers to the poet [...] "Rihaku", the pronunciation in Japanese of the Tang dynasty Chinese poet, Li Bai, whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity. Alexander <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> is the most attractive [...] of Pound's work. Chinese critic Wai-lim Yip writes of it: [...] "One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but {{it seems clear that}} in his dealings with Cathay, even when he is given only the barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author by what we may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'I {{wrote it}} because it was {{necessary}} for me to write it,' Mariah said of her most personal, and angriest, song to date. Fans might be surprised at her references to 'the hell that we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to be kind of on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E
500|$|Molecular {{phylogeny}} {{indicates that}} Phoronida {{are closely related}} to Brachiopoda, but Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) are not closely related to this group, despite using a similar lophophore for feeding and respiration. This implies that the traditional definition [...] "Lophophorata" [...] is not monophyletic. Recently the term [...] "Lophophorata" [...] has been applied only to the Phoronida and Brachiopoda, and Halanych <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> change will cause confusion. Some analyses regard Phoronida and Brachiopoda as sister-groups, while others place Phoronida as a sub-group within Brachiopoda, implying that Brachiopoda is paraphyletic. Cohen and Weydman's analysis (2005) concludes that phoronids are a sub-group of inarticulate brachiopods (those in which the hinge between the two valves have no teeth and sockets) and sister-group of the other inarticulate [...] sub-groups. The authors also suggest that the ancestors of molluscs and the brachiopod+phoronid clade diverged between 900 Ma and 560 Ma, most probably about 685 Ma.|$|E

500|$|Alan Woodhouse from NME was {{unfavorable}} in {{his review}} about the compilation, reckoning Madonna's career as two distinct phases, them being her [...] "80s output" [...] and her later career, or [...] "phaze two", summarizing by saying that [...] "Madonna clearly <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> collection represents a celebration of her longevity [...] in reality all it does it expose her more recent failings", though Woodhouse also called it [...] "unfair to say Madge hasn’t touched magic since 1990" [...] before naming [...] "Hung Up" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Douglas Wolk, from Pitchfork, reviewed the album in the same light, also comparing her early work with the later days, stating that [...] "'Hung Up' is really the only song from the post-GHV2 period that's lodged in the American pop consciousness", concluding with saying that [...] " [...] deserves a retrospective more interesting than this haphazard piece of contract-filling product.", though being positive about the opening sequence, calling that [...] "incredibly strong, a convincing argument for her genius." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hammond {{was a key}} {{instrument}} in progressive rock music. Author Edward Macan <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> is because of its versatility, allowing both chords and lead lines to be played, and a choice between quiet and clean, and what Emerson described as a [...] "tacky, aggressive, almost distorted, angry sound." [...] Emerson first found commercial success with the Nice, with whom he used and abused an L-100, putting knives in the instrument, setting fire to it, playing it upside down, or riding it across stage {{in the manner of}} a horse. He continued to play the {{instrument in}} this manner alongside other keyboards in Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Other prominent Hammond organists in progressive rock include the Zombies' and Argent's Rod Argent, Yes's Tony Kaye and Rick Wakeman, Focus's Thijs van Leer, Uriah Heep's Ken Hensley, Pink Floyd's Rick Wright, Kansas's Steve Walsh, and Genesis's Tony Banks. Banks later claimed he only used the Hammond because a piano was impractical to transport to gigs.|$|E

He persuades Bianca to enact a scene with him before the drawn window curtain in which she is attacked by {{a man with a}} pistol and drawing a dagger from her bosom, defends herself, killing her assailant. Brown, seeing all this in silhouette on the shade, rushes to Bianca's assistance. He finds her reading peacefully, and is told that the incident must have been an hallucination of his own brain. A few evenings after this Bianca actually is attacked by a burglar. Brown, who now is [...] "on" [...] to {{the fact that in the}} former instance his friend Sparks had designs upon him, at first <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> also is another of Sparks' [...] "jokes".
