40|$|Injuries to {{articular}} cartilage {{result in the}} development of lesions that form {{on the surface of the}} cartilage. Such lesions are associated with {{articular cartilage}} degeneration and osteoarthritis. The <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> response often causes collateral damage, primarily an effect of inflammation, which results in the spread of lesions beyond the region where the initial injury occurs. We present a minimal mathematical model based on known mechanisms to investigate the spread and abatement of such lesions. In particular we represent the "balancing act" between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that is hypothesized to be a principal mechanism in the expansion properties of cartilage damage during the <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> response. We present preliminary results of in vitro studies that confirm the anti-inflammatory activities of the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). We assume that the diffusion of cytokines determine the spatial behaviour of injury response and lesion expansion so that a reaction-diffusion system involving chemical species and chondrocyte cell state population densities is a natural way to represent cartilage injury response. We present computational results using the mathematical model showing that our representation is successful in capturing much of the interesting spatial behaviour of injury associated lesion development and abatement in articular cartilage. Further, we discuss the use of this model to study the possibility of using EPO as a therapy for reducing the amount of inflammation induced collateral damage to cartilage during the <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> response. The mathematical model presented herein suggests that not only are anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as EPO necessary to prevent chondrocytes signaled by pro-inflammatory cytokines from entering apoptosis, they may also influence how chondrocytes respond to signaling by pro-inflammatory cytokines.

40|$|BACKGROUND This article {{addresses}} <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> patterns {{related to}} the traditional Swiss team sport of Hornussen. A small plastic disk is struck with a special elastic racket and then intercepted in the field. Severe injuries have occasionally been reported. We present a systematic review of all cases of Hornussen injuries treated in the University Hospital of Bern from 2000 to 2014. METHODS To assess the frequency, type and outcome of Hornussen injuries, we performed a database search of all inpatient and outpatient cases related to Hornussen and that were admitted to and/or treated in Bern University Hospital from 2000 to 2014. RESULTS A total of 28 such patients could be identified. Apart from 1 woman injured as a bystander and treated as an outpatient, all patients were male and active players. <b>Typical</b> <b>injury</b> patterns comprised midfacial fractures and severe ocular traumata, very often in combination. Almost all of these patients had to be hospitalised due to {{the severity of the}} trauma suffered and underwent surgery. 1 patient had to be admitted to the intensive care unit prior to the operation. CONCLUSIONS Eye and face injuries caused by Hornussen can be devastating. This resembles the potential risk of other bat-and-ball sports, such as cricket and baseball. Apart from the economic loss due to treatment costs and sick leave, these injuries can be disabling for life. It should therefore be mandatory for all players to wear protective gear, as is already the case for Hornussen players born in 1984 or later...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} addresses recent {{calls to}} incorporate multidisciplinary approaches {{in the study}} of firearm violence by utilizing an elaborated criminal events perspective to explore the correlates of firearm injury severity. A unique dataset of nonfatal firearm injury data are derived from official police reports, allowing the use of a medically validated measure of injury trauma in place of more <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> indicators. The relative and collaborative contributions of criminological and public health indicators for explaining variation in levels of injury severity are assessed. Multinomial logit models suggest that critical injuries are more likely among older victims, victims who knew their assailants, and victims who refused to cooperate with police. Additionally, the likelihood of critical victim injuries decreased as the time to report an incident to the police increased. The strongest correlates were measures of incident circumstances and the number of gunshot wounds a victim received. In all, these results reveal that a combination of measures from both fields is needed to provide a deeper understanding of injury severity outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this case}} report is to {{characterize}} injury patterns typical for chainsaw injuries to the face. We describe our approach to the soft tissue and skeletal injury patterns seen in these injuries. Methods: We present a case report of a traumatic chainsaw injury to the face. Results: A literature review of the <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> patterns seen in chainsaw injuries to the face is discussed. Fractures to the bony orbit are on {{of the most common}} findings. Traumatic orbital fractures are often associated with other facial fractures, including those of the maxillary sinus and naso-orbitalethmoid (NOE) region. There is a reported 47 % incidence of lacrimal obstruction after NOE fractures, most caused by bone malposition or damage to the lacrimal sac or duct. Misdiagnosis of this injury pattern can lead to chronic patient morbidity. Conclusion: We present a case of traumatic orbital fracture with subsequent bony intrusion into the orbit, necessitating urgent exploration.

The inference is based on decision tree models which recursively split data along explanatory variables, and so practitioners can understand these models. We propose the Bayesian method for estimating the predictive density and show that it outperforms the TRISS method in terms of both goodness-of-fit and classification accuracy.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a synthesis of}} results from different studies on effects of air pollution on crops in two regions of northern (Po Plain) and central (Tuscany) Italy. The methodologies used were: (1) biological monitoring of ozone with indicator plants; (2) ambient air pollution exclusion experiments with open-top chambers; (3) controlled fumigation with sulphur dioxide in greenhouse chambers. The results so far obtained indicate that: (1) photochemical air pollution is widespread at a regional level in northern and central Italy at levels above the thresholds for phytotoxicity; (2) ambient oxidant pollution is probably causing significant biological effects and yield losses to various crop species in the Po Plain (these effects are in some cases coupled to the <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> symptoms caused by ozone-brown stipples or foliar flecks). In contrast, sulphur dioxide fumigation only affects plant growth and physiology at levels above those usually experienced at rural sites.

40|$|Nijmegen {{breakage}} syndrome (NBS) is a genomic instability disease {{caused by}} hypomorphic mutations in the NBS 1 gene encoding the Nbs 1 (nibrin) protein. Nbs 1 is {{a component of}} the Mre 11 /Rad 50 /Nbs 1 (MRN) complex that acts as a sensor of double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA and is critical for proper activation of the broad cellular response to DSBs. Conditional disruption of the murine ortholog of the human NBS 1, Nbs 1, in the CNS of mice was previously reported to cause microcephaly, severe cerebellar atrophy and ataxia. Here we report that conditional targeted disruption of the murine NBS 1 gene in the CNS results in mal-development, degeneration, disorganization and dysfunction of the murine visual system, especially in the optic nerve. Nbs 1 deletion resulted in reduced diameters of Nbs 1 -CNS-Δ eye and optic nerve. MRI analysis revealed defective white matter development and organization. Nbs 1 inactivation altered the morphology and organization of the glial cells. Interestingly, at the age of two-month-old the levels of the axonal guidance molecule semaphorin- 3 A and its receptor neuropilin- 1 were up-regulated in the retina of the mutant mice, a <b>typical</b> <b>injury</b> response.

The {{objective of the}} present study was to assess the outcome of palm burns and to identify the risk factors for long-term sequelae. All patients admitted to our hospital affected with isolated palm injuries between January of 1988 and January of 1998 were reviewed. In total, 120 pediatric patients were admitted with isolated palm burns; 110 patients (91. 7 percent) had partial-thickness burns, and 10 patients (8. 3 percent) had full-thickness burns. Only four patients (3. 3 percent) required excision and skin autografting, but all patients whose palms were operated on in the acute phase developed burn contractures. Sixteen patients (13. 3 per cent) developed palmar contractures, and more than half of them (56 percent) required reconstructive procedures. All palm burns that healed in more than 3 weeks developed scarring and sequelae (p < 0. 05 compared with no sequelae). Pediatric palmar burns are benign injuries with a low incidence of late sequelae. However, flame and contact burns are more prone to develop scarring.
