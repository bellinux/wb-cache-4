5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E

500|$|Known for his charisma, personality, and iconic stature on the court, Rudolph symbolized NBA officiating {{during the}} early years of the NBA to fans of {{professional}} basketball and became the most recognizable official during the NBA's first four decades.

[...] Upon retirement, he set a precedent for <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> future referees are judged. [...] Early in his officiating career, Joe Crawford (later hired by the NBA in 1977) attended games that Rudolph worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and studied his style and approach. [...] Earl Strom credited Rudolph for being an influence on the development of his career in the NBA. [...] In his autobiography, Calling the Shots, Strom described Rudolph as [...] "one of the most prominent referees because of his style, courage, and judgment. [...] He had excellent judgment. [...] He made the call regardless of the pressure, whom it involved, or where it was." [...] Strom later told The New York Times that [...] "Mendy Rudolph was simply the greatest referee of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|Guidelines {{have been}} set up by various {{governing}} bodies regarding <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> are followed by practicing forensic scientists. [...] For forensic chemists, the international Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (SWGDRUG) presents recommendations for the quality assurance and quality control of tested materials. [...] In the identification of unknown samples, protocols have been grouped into three categories based on the probability for false positives. [...] Instruments and protocols in category A are considered the best for uniquely identifying an unknown material, followed by categories B and then C. [...] To ensure the accuracy of identifications SWGDRUG recommends that multiple tests using different instruments be performed on each sample, and that one category A technique and at least one other technique be used. [...] If a category A technique is not available, or the forensic chemist decides not to use one, SWGDRUG recommends that at least three techniques be used, two of which must be from category B. [...] Combination instruments, such as GC-MS, are considered two separate tests as long as the results are compared to known values individually [...] For example, the GC elution times would be compared to known values along with the MS spectra. [...] If both of those match a known substance, no further tests are needed.|$|E

2500|$|Kenny G has {{attracted}} significant criticism from mainstream jazz musicians and enthusiasts.

[...] Branford Marsalis once stated in an interview with Jazziz magazine: [...] "When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He's not stealing jazz.

2500|$|In 2001, a {{consortium}} of news organizations, assisted by professional statisticians , examined numerous hypothetical ways of recounting all the Florida ballots. The study was conducted {{over a period of}} 10 months. The consortium examined 175,010 ballots that vote-counting machines had rejected. In each alternative way of recounting the rejected ballots, the number of additional votes for Gore was smaller than the 537-vote lead that state election officials ultimately awarded Bush. Under the strategy that Al Gore pursued {{at the beginning of the}} Florida recount — filing suit to force hand recounts in four predominantly Democratic counties — Bush would have kept his lead, according to the ballot review conducted by the consortium. Likewise, if Florida's 67 counties had carried out the hand recount of disputed ballots ordered by the Florida Supreme Court on December 8, applying <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> election officials said they would have used, Bush would have emerged the victor by 493 votes. On the other hand, the study also found that if the official vote-counting standards had not rejected ballots containing overvotes (where a voter selects more than one candidate in a race where each voter may only choose one candidate) a statewide tally would have resulted in Gore emerging as the victor by 60 to 171 votes. These tallies conducted by the NORC consortium are caveated with the statement: [...] "But no study of this type can accurately recreate Election Day 2000 or predict what might have emerged from individual battles over more than 6 million votes in Florida's 67 counties." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>that</b> make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
