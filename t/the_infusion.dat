5|$|By {{the end of}} 1943, No. 9 OG, {{originally}} the RAAF's mobile strike formation, had effectively become a static garrison force in New Guinea. Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function. Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation, {{which led to the}} establishment of No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) on 13November 1943 at Nadzab, under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger. In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of No.9 OG, as well as responsibility for the Port Moresby and Milne Bay sectors. Bostock again recommended changing No.9 OG's name to Northern Area, and also proposed changing No.10 OG's name to Tactical Air Force, RAAF, in view of its increased strength from <b>the</b> <b>infusion</b> of new squadrons. No.9 OG became Northern Command on 11April. On 14September, Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin, wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command, particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations, and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces. Bostock concurred; Curtin meanwhile authorised changing No.10 OG's name to First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), with effect from 25October. RAAF Command's complement had now swelled to forty-one Australian squadrons.|$|E

5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make <b>the</b> <b>infusion</b> of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} infusions of Escherichia coli endotoxin on the acute phase {{response in the}} bovine mammary gland was assessed through the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in milk. Four clinically normal lactating cows received two intramammary infusions of E coli endotoxin (33 mu g) 24 h apart in the same mammary quarter. Alone with <b>the</b> second <b>infusion,</b> <b>the</b> cows received one dose of endotoxin in the contralateral quarter. Milk was collected at varying intervals before and after infusion and TNF-alpha concentrations were determined by ELISA. Following <b>the</b> first <b>infusion</b> at 0 h, the mean concentrations of TNF-alpha augmented from undetectable concentrations {{to a maximum of}} 0. 4 ng/mL at 4 h and declined to below 0. 04 ng/mL at 24 h, the time of <b>the</b> second <b>infusion.</b> In <b>the</b> quarters challenged twice, the increase in TNF-alpha concentrations was abrupt, culminating at 11. 7 ng/mL 6 h later (at 30 h). The increases in TNF-alpha concentrations were similar in the contralateral quarters infused once. TNF-alpha concentrations in the control, uninfused quarters of infused cows remained undetectable (< 0. 04 ng/mL). Despite the low TNF-alpha response following <b>the</b> first <b>infusion,</b> mean somatic cell counts increased markedly, bring only slightly lower than after <b>the</b> second <b>infusion</b> (10 (7) /mL and 5 x 10 (7) /mL at 8 h and 32 h, respectively) in the quarters challenged twice. After <b>the</b> first <b>infusion,</b> none of <b>the</b> cows developed fever, but following <b>the</b> second <b>infusion,</b> rectal temperature increased markedly, culminating 6 h after <b>the</b> second <b>infusion.</b> These results show that an infusion in one quarter of an amount of endotoxin sufficient to induce a pronounced cell recruitment but insufficient to induce a marked TNF-alpha secretion following <b>the</b> first <b>infusion</b> sensitized not only that quarter but also the contralateral one to a second <b>infusion</b> with <b>the</b> endotoxin.

40|$|Results of a {{double-blind}} randomized non-crossover {{study of}} rapid (45 min) versus slow (4 h) infusion of amphotericin B administered to 20 patients with proven or suspected fungal infection are reported.

When analyzed on a daily basis, the mean chill score, meperidine dosage, and pulse rise were also higher; and in addition, nausea and vomiting (5 of 11 patients who received a rapid infusion versus 0 of 9 patients who received a slow infusion [P less than 0. 01]) appeared to be more common in those who received amphotericin B rapidly. The daily analysis approach proved that tolerance to these side effects developed with each subsequent infusion day, and by day 7 the incidence and severity were the same.

Recent observations suggest that activation of α-adrenoceptors can inhibit the release of nitric oxide. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the effect of α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor activation on nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. Methodology: In a first set of experiments, the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine (ACh), 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT), and bradykinin (BK), and the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were administered in a random order in the brachial artery together with saline, or the nonselective α-adrenoceptor agonists norepinephrine or clonidine, or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). <b>The</b> <b>infusions</b> of saline, norepinephrine, clonidine, and L-NMMA started 10 minutes before <b>the</b> <b>infusions</b> of ACh, BK, 5 HT, and SNP. In a second set of experiments, cumulative doses of ACh, BK, and 5 HT were infused, in a random order, intra-arterially together with saline or the selective α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. <b>The</b> <b>infusions</b> of saline and methoxamine started 5 minutes before <b>the</b> <b>infusions</b> of ACh, BK, and 5 HT. Forearm blood flow was measured using computerized venous occlusion plethysmography. Results: ACh, 5 HT, BK, and SNP induced a significant increase in forearm blood flow (p < 0. 05 for all). These vasodilator responses were significantly attenuated by norepinephrine, clonidine, and L-NMMA (p < 0. 05 for all), except for SNP. In the second set of experiments, all three endothelium-dependent vasodilators induced a dose-dependent vasodilation, which was significantly inhibited by methoxamine (p < 0. 05).
