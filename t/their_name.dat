5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like <b>their</b> <b>name</b> letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like <b>their</b> <b>name</b> letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E

During baseline, the students were unable to write all of the letters in <b>their</b> <b>names.</b> During intervention, the students traced unknown letters using work sheets made with D’Nealian® Handwriting. In the second intervention, students traced specific letters of <b>their</b> last <b>name.</b> The results suggested that tracing letters using worksheets with D’Nealian handwriting work sheets effectively taught preschool students with disabilities to write <b>their</b> <b>names.</b> Recommendations regarding additional classroom applications of these procedures are made...|$|R
