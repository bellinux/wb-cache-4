5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>of</b> the Shipbuilding Commissariat which {{said it would}} be {{impossible}} to lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E

5|$|Despite Justinian's {{intentions}} and proclamations, however, Roman control over Africa {{was not yet}} secure. During his campaign, Belisarius had secured most of the provinces of Byzacena, Zeugitana and Tripolitania. Further west, on the other hand, imperial control extended {{in a series of}} strongholds captured by the fleet along the coast as far as Constantine, while most of the inland areas of Numidia and Mauretania remained {{under the control of the}} local Moorish tribes, as indeed had been the case under the Vandal kings. The Moors initially acknowledged the Emperor's suzerainty and gave hostages to the imperial authorities, but they soon became restive and rose in revolt. The first imperial governor, Belisarius' former domesticus Solomon, who combined the offices of both magister militum and praetorian prefect, was able to score successes against them and strengthen Roman rule in Africa, but his work was interrupted by a widespread military mutiny in 536. The mutiny was eventually subdued by Germanus, a cousin of Justinian, and Solomon returned in 539. He fell, however, in the Battle of Cillium in 544 against the united Moorish tribes, and Roman Africa was again in jeopardy. It would not be until 548 that <b>the</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>of</b> the Moorish tribes would be finally broken by the talented general John Troglita.|$|E
