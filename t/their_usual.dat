5|$|Leucism {{differs from}} {{albinism}} {{in that the}} melanin is, at least, partially absent but the eyes retain <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> color. Some leucistic animals are white or pale because of chromatophore (pigment cell) defects, and do not lack melanin.|$|E
5|$|The velites {{were used}} against the Carthaginian {{elephants}} in the Battle of Zama.

5|$|Abandoning <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> {{strategy}} {{of trying to}} make major inroads in Liberal-dominated Quebec, the Tories focused on winning seats in the other provinces. They were successful; though they gained few seats in Quebec, they won 112seats overall to the Liberals' 105. With the remaining seats won by other parties, the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons, but the margin was sufficient to make John Diefenbaker Canada's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935.|$|E
5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} palace, three {{servants}} and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{prepared}} for the match by training in the spa town of Buxton. Bolton Wanderers followed <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> training schedule {{for most of the}} week, then travelled to Harrow on the Thursday. All eleven men who played for Bolton in their 1923 triumph were still at the club. Of those, only the injured Alex Finney was absent as they travelled to London. Jack Smith had been injured for several weeks {{in the run-up to the}} final, but recovered in time and participated in Bolton's last league match before the tie.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{applications}} of Hilbert spaces exploit {{the fact that}} Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts like projection and change of basis from <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> finite dimensional setting. In particular, the spectral theory of continuous self-adjoint linear operators on a Hilbert space generalizes the usual spectral decomposition of a matrix, and this often {{plays a major role}} in applications of the theory to other areas of mathematics and physics.|$|E
50|$|Public key {{infrastructures}} (PKIs) {{have been}} proposed as a way around this problem of identity authentication. In <b>their</b> most <b>usual</b> implementation, each user applies to a 'certificate authority' for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a non-tamperable authentication of identity, {{at the risk of}} compromising every user in case the CA itself is compromised.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched {{letters to the}} monarchs of Europe, preaching <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.|$|E
5|$|On the Cardinals' side, {{the media}} {{expressed}} disappointment at the team's failure {{to win a}} game in the Series after recording the team's best regular season in over 60years. Many reporters believed that the Cardinals had not played up to <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> standard, {{and much of the}} blame was directed at Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best hitters, who had combined for one hit in 39at bats in the series.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks {{a departure}} from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> pop punk sound. These elements were inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{this article}} the letters R,L and C are used with <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> {{meanings}} to represent resistance, inductance and capacitance, respectively. In particular {{they are used}} in combinations, such as LC, to mean, for instance, a network consisting only of inductors and capacitors. Z is used for electrical impedance, any 2-terminal combination of RLC elements and in some sections D {{is used for the}} rarely seen quantity elastance, which is the inverse of capacitance.|$|E
5|$|Triarii (singular: Triarius) {{were one}} of the {{elements}} of the early Roman military manipular legions of the early Roman Republic (509 BC – 107 BC). They were the oldest and among the wealthiest men in the army and could afford high quality equipment. They wore heavy metal armor and carried large shields, <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> position being the third battle line. They were equipped with spears and were considered to be elite soldiers among the legion.|$|E
5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have <b>their</b> <b>usual</b> properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
