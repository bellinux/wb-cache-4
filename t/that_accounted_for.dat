5|$|From the 1940s to the 1960s, The Accounting Review {{published}} articles of greater diversity, and leading authors {{during this period}} tended to have less practical accounting experience and more formal education. During this period, the three individuals <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> most of the editorial duties of the journal were A. C. Littleton (1944-1947), Frank Smith (1950-1959) and Robert Mautz (1960-1962), all of whom either had practical accounting experience, or were leading authors prior to 1945, when the journal was oriented towards the accounting practice.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{during the war}} despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure {{to pay for the}} expansion of the military and the air training scheme. Expenditure on the war grew from £1,793,367 in the financial year 1940–41 to £5,334,701 in 1943–44—total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air training scheme was £11,215,522. These sums, while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70,000 <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> most of the colony's economic output. Annual costs for the air training scheme alone far exceeded the pre-war national budget.|$|E
5|$|In Mozambique, Domoina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} {{in the capital}} Maputo <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 40% of the annual total. Floods in the country destroyed over 50small dams and left widespread crop damage just before the summer harvest. Later, the rains caused the worst flooding in over 20years in Swaziland, which damaged or destroyed more than 100bridges. Disrupted transport left areas isolated for several days. In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950mm (37in), which flooded 29river basins, notably the Pongola River which altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. Throughout the region, Domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses, roads, and crops, leaving about $199million in damage. There were 242deaths in southeastern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|With the {{publication}} of his Principia roughly eighty years later (1687), Isaac Newton provided a physical theory <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. In particular, Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a central force F(r) that varied as the inverse square of the distance r between them. Arguing from his laws of motion, Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a conic section, specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity. However, this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present (the two-body problem); the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation (the n-body problem) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton, although solutions to a few special cases were discovered. Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun's gravitation is dominant; to first approximation, the presence of the other planets can be ignored. By analogy, the elliptical orbit of the Moon about the Earth was dominated by the Earth's gravity; to first approximation, the Sun's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected. However, Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions; in particular, he stated that the precession of the Moon's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Aquinas {{claimed that}} X’s soul was X’s only {{substantial}} form, although X also had numerous accidental forms <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> X’s nonessential features. Aquinas defined a substantial form {{as that which}} makes X's matter constitute X, which {{in the case of}} a human being is rational capacity. He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms. However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person. He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person. So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.|$|E

Junior college transfer Terrance Cain won in his debut at quarterback for the Utes, completing 20 of 30 attempts for 286 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, while running back Matt Asiata ran for a career-best 156 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and David Reed caught 10 passes for 172 yards.

A report written in April 16, 1973 to the U.S. Department of State titled “Widespread Arrests And Psychophysical Interrogation Of Suspected Subversive” gave specific details <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> what happened in Brazil. According to the report, there had been dramatically increased in arrests in 1973, with a specific week period. The majority of suspects were university students. These students were arrested within several week period in the Rio area. When arrested and interrogated, the suspects were “submitted to the old methods of physical violence, which sometimes cause death.” The increased in number of suspects stemmed from police report, especially on individual who were jailed before.|$|E
25|$|The Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival was a four-day-long weekend {{music festival}} held {{annually}} in early June just outside Lawrence, at Clinton State Park. After {{its inception in}} 2004, the festival grew dramatically by 2006, with almost 60,000 tickets sold, and developed a nationwide following <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 80% of ticket sales. The festival featured {{an eclectic mix of}} music, with artists like The Flaming Lips, Wilco, STS9, Medeski, Martin and Wood, Neko Case, and Widespread Panic taking the stage. The event is kept smaller than other festivals such as Bonnaroo by an agreement with the state. Activities other than music include disc golf, yoga, hiking, and swimming in Clinton Lake. The festival was relocated to Mulberry Mountain due to a dispute between the organizers and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks over limiting attendees and over rent payment.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Manchester between 1908 and 1913, Rutherford {{directed}} Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in {{a series}} of experiments to determine what happens when alpha particles scatter from metal foil. Now called the Rutherford gold foil experiment, or the Geiger–Marsden experiment, these measurements made the extraordinary discovery that alpha particles would occasionally scatter to high angle when passing through a thin gold foil. The scattering indicated that the alpha particles were reflecting from a small, but dense, component of atoms. Based on these measurements, in 1911 Rutherford developed a model for the atom that consisted of a small massive nucleus with positive charge surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons. The concentrated atomic mass was required to provide the observed reflection of the alpha particles, and Rutherford developed a mathematical model <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> the scattering.|$|E
