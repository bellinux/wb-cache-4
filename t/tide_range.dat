50|$|Rail linkspans are {{generally}} supported at their outer end by counterweights. This {{means that when}} the linkspan is lowered onto the ship’s ledge only {{a small proportion of}} its weight rests there. However half of the weight of the train on the linkspan is transferred to the ledge. When it becomes necessary to make longer linkspans to accommodate a greater <b>tide</b> <b>range</b> the train loads become proportionately higher until a critical reaction is reached. Before this point is reached, it is usual to create a second span with this inner span being adjusted at its outer end, where it is hinged to the outer span. Rail ferries must not only have the correct rail alignment, but their stern configuration and beam must be an exact fit for the berth it is to use.|$|E

5000|$|Spring <b>tide</b> <b>range</b> for {{the islands}} is around 2 m, {{decreasing}} to a neap tide of around 1 m. The deep water {{around the island}} results in only moderate tidal currents. These are around the same magnitude as the prevailing shelf currents. In the general vicinity of the islands mean flows are around 0.2 m/s and run toward the southeast. [...] A remarkable feature of the region is the large internal tides that occur. These are a form of internal wave driven by the local tidal flow forcing the stratification against sloping areas of the shelf face.

Internal wave amplitudes of around 100 m have been observed, generating flow speeds as great as 0.5 m/s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tide</b> <b>range</b> is the {{vertical}} {{distance between the}} highest high tide and lowest low tide. The size of the lunar tide compared to the solar tide (which comes once every 12 hours) is generally about 2 to 1, but the actual proportion along any particular shore depends on the location, orientation, {{and shape of the}} local bay or estuary. Along some shorelines, the solar tide is the only important tide, and ordinary 12-hour clocks suffice since the high and low tides come at nearly the same time every day. Because ordinary tidal clocks only track a part of the tidal effect, and because the relative size of the combined effects is different in different places, they are in general only partially accurate for tracking the tides. Consequently, all navigators use tide tables either in a booklet, computer or digital tide clock.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{constructing}} a {{tidal power plant}} on the Rance dates to Gerard Boisnoer in 1921. The site was attractive because of the wide average-range between low and high tide levels, 8 m with a maximum perigean spring <b>tide</b> <b>range</b> of 13.5 m. The first studies which envisaged a tidal plant on the Rance were done by the Society for the Study of Utilization of the Tides in 1943. Nevertheless, work did not actually commence until 1961. Albert Caquot, the visionary engineer, {{was instrumental in the}} construction of the dam, designing an enclosure in order to protect the construction site from the ocean tides and the strong streams. Construction necessitated draining the area where the plant was to be built, which required construction of two dams which took two years. Construction of the plant commenced on 20 July 1963, while the Rance was entirely blocked by the two dams.|$|E

50|$|This {{beach is}} {{considered}} by many surfers {{to be one of the}} top spots in Costa Rica. It has become famous in part to its ease of access apart from its quality as a surfing wave. Playa Negra has a rock reef bottom with good right-hand barrels and a well defined channel for paddling out. This channel also assists surfers to return to the point where the wave breaks. There is a strong rip current that takes the surfers back through the impact zone. Depending on the swell direction and tides a left breaking wave may also be surfed. The break has good exposure to both Northern and Southern Hemisphere swells and is reasonably consistent year-round. The wave can break well with large and small swells. The 2012 Costa Rica earthquake lifted up the entire plate which caused the wave to have better form on higher tides in combination with smaller swells. It may also produce good surfing waves during the entire <b>tide</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Tidal {{flooding}}, {{also known}} as sunny day flooding or nuisance flooding, is the temporary inundation of low-lying areas, especially streets, during exceptionally high tide events, such as at full and new moons. The highest tides of the year may {{be known as the}} king tide, with the month varying by location. In Florida, controversy was created when state-level government mandated that the term [...] "nuisance flooding" [...] and other terms be used in place of terms such as sea level rise, climate change and global warming, prompting allegations of climate change denial, specifically against Governor Rick Scott. This amid Florida, specifically South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area being one of the most at risk areas in the world for the potential effects of sea level rise, and where the frequency and severity of tidal flooding events increased in the 21st century. The issue is more bipartisan in South Florida, particularly in places like Miami Beach, where a several hundred million dollar project is underway to install more than 50 pumps and physically raise roads to combat the flooding, mainly along the west side of South Beach, formerly a mangrove wetland where the average elevation is less than one meter (3.3 feet). In the Miami area, where {{the vast majority of the}} land is below 10 ft, even a one-foot increase over the average high tide can cause widespread flooding. The 2015 and 2016 king tide event levels reached about 4 ft MLLW, 3 ft above mean sea level, or about 2 ft NAVD88, and nearly the same above MHHW. While the <b>tide</b> <b>range</b> is very small in Miami, averaging about 2 ft, with the greatest range being less than 2 m, the area is very acute to minute differences down to single inches due to the vast area at low elevation. NOAA tide gauge data for most stations shows current water level graphs relative to a fixed datum, as well as mean sea level trends for some stations. During the king tides, the local Miami area tide gauge at Virginia Key shows levels running at times 1 ft or more over datum.|$|E

ST 01 occurs during a neap <b>tide</b> (<b>range</b> 1. 0 m) when peak currents through the inlet are at a minimum, allowing wave action to move sediment onshore from the ebb delta, reducing inlet cross section and promoting closure. ST 02 occurs between spring and neap <b>tide</b> (<b>range</b> 2. 0 m), where ebb tidal currents {{are strong enough to}} inhibit wave action, causing tidal dominance within the channel, delta toe and inlet throat, and wave dominance on the up-drift and down-drift swash platforms and adjacent beaches.

40|$|These Applied Geomorphology Guidelines {{will be used}} by the ESA team’s {{conceptual}} designs. The Guidelines will be used {{as needed}} in the designs and to aid in quality control review. These guidelines may be revised to account for lessons learned during Phase 2 and for subsequent use. The guidelines are intended only for conceptual design by the PSNERP team. These guidelines are established partly to provide a means of developing uniform designs, for quality control and precision, but also to facilitating future refinements. Further research and data collection are required to develop guidelines for broader application. These guidelines use empirical models calibrated with data collected from field sites.

30|$|Zone 3 shows strong {{vertical}} stratification. This type of stratification {{is observed}} mainly in microtidal estuaries (<b>tide</b> <b>range</b> < 1  m) (Davies 1964; Hayes 1975; Allen 1993), although {{in this part}} of the estuary the Oued Loukkos retains its mesotidal property, which qualifies this area of Oued Loukkos as a well stratified mesotidal estuary. This implies that when the flow in the river is low, as it was during this survey, the effect of the bed topography lengthens the residence time of fresh water in the river, and thereby plays a role in freshening the water in this upstream reach of the estuary.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSwash bar {{development}} {{has been well documented}} from coasts with low to moderate tidal ranges, while studies of the effects of these forms on the morphology and dynamics of the adjacent shore in large <b>tide</b> <b>range</b> environments are rare. The analysis of sequential vertical aerial photographs was combined with field work in order to highlight the effects of swash bar development on the adjacent shoreline in the vicinity of a megatidal inlet (mean spring tidal range of 11 m). Swash bars are observed to form on the ebb tidal delta and to migrate landward before welding onto the coast. A close relationship was noticed between the position of the swash bar and shoreline dynamics. The bar protects the shore against wave attack in a sedimentary system controlled by longshore transport. This protective role is, however, modulated by the large tidal range. As the bar migrates upward toward the high‐tide level and the subaerial beach, it develops morphologically into a transverse form that acts as a cross‐shore obstacle to longshore sediment transport, thus resulting in shoreline accretion updrift and in strong erosion downdrift. This disturbance may persist for years because of the relatively slow speed of movement of the bar at this stage, an aspect characteristic of large <b>tide</b> <b>range</b> environments. This pattern of behavior differs fundamentally from that documented in the literature where the perturbation of the longshore sediment transport occurs over shorter periods. An original conceptual model of swash bar morphodynamics and repercussions on the adjacent shoreline for this megatidal environment is proposed...|$|E
