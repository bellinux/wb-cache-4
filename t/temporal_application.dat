40|$|Time is {{a concept}} that highly depends on the {{socio-cultural}} context. Its perception by humans is primarily based on the cultures, nations and social environment they belong to. Hence, different socio-cultural contexts imply different understandings of time. This leads to communication problems when their members start interacting with each other. In a dynamic and multi-cultural environment like today’s Web, where both billions of people with different socio-cultural contexts and numerous context dependent software applications interact, similar communication and inter-operability problems are expected. Expressing socio-cultural temporal information in an unambiguous, explicit and machine processable way can, however, help reduce such communication conflicts. In this way, heterogeneous <b>temporal</b> Web <b>application</b> systems can share the same concept of time. In this paper we present an ontology of socio-cultural time expressions that attempts to formalize the notion of socio-cultural time. The resulting model can then be used in a Web based <b>temporal</b> <b>applications</b> such as automated appointment scheduling services or calendars to provide more context sensitive service to its users...|$|R

This paper addresses this challenge by identifying requirements regarding an information model for <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> landscape management from an extensive survey, during which the demands from practitioners and existing tool support for EA management were analyzed. Furthermore, we discuss shortcomings of existing approaches to landscape management in literature and propose an information model, which can address the identified requirements via modeling techniques from nearby disciplines. ...|$|E

40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{mechanical}} stimulation {{have been shown}} to enhance chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the response of MSCs undergoing chondrogenesis to such signals has been shown to depend on the <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> of loading. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of dynamic compression on cartilage-matrix-specific gene expression and to relate this response to the local biochemical environment and cell phenotype at the time of loading. At 0, 7, 14, and 21 days extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition within MSC-seeded agarose hydrogels due to transforming growth factor-β 3 stimulation was determined biochemically and histologically, and then reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the effects of dynamic compression on cartilage-matrix-specific gene expression. The results of these experiments show that the local environment in the core of the constructs is more favorable for chondrogenesis in comparison to the annulus, as evident from both ECM synthesis and gene expression. Additionally, we found that the response of the cells to mechanical stimulus varied with both the spatial region within the constructs and the <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> of loading. Dynamic compression applied at day 21 was found to enhance levels of cartilage matrix gene expression following a peak in expression levels at day 14 in free swelling constructs, suggesting that mechanical signals play a key role in the maintenance of a chondrogenic phenotype. The application of mechanical stimulus to enhance cartilage ECM synthesis may be an important tool in regenerative medicine-based cartilage repair. The results of this study suggest that a chondrogenic phenotype and/or a well-developed pericellular matrix must first be established before dynamic compression can have a positive effect on cartilage-matrix-specific gene expression...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a framework for}} modeling and developing temporal information systems. The framework defines a model driven development process which automatically transforms temporal system models into executable systems. <b>Temporal</b> <b>applications</b> have semantics not represented in conventional modeling languages, and the main contribution {{in this case is}} a temporal extension to an existing UML profile. The UML profile is extended with temporal concepts and constructs to provide a temporal conceptual modeling language. Temporal features are introduced by model elements defined with valid time semantics, that is, the information model captures earlier and possible future states as well as the current state of entities. The approach is based on timestamping entities with valid time intervals to represent when states of an entity were valid in the modeled reality. Based on the semantically extended models designed using the temporal profile the framework allows automatic code generation of temporal information systems. Thus, we provide model driven tool support for developing <b>temporal</b> valid time <b>applications...</b>|$|R

This is exacerbated in hybrid programming models such as SPMD+OpenMP. We present {{the design of}} a "multi-threaded" runtime able to transparently increase the instantaneous network concurrency and to provide near saturation bandwidth, independent of the application configuration and dynamic behavior. The runtime forwards communication requests from application level tasks to multiple communication servers. Our techniques alleviate the need for spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> level message concurrency optimizations. Experimental results show improved message throughput and bandwidth by as much as 150 % for 4 KB bytes messages on InfiniBand and by as much as 120 % for 4 KB byte messages on Cray Aries. For more complex operations such as all-to-all collectives, we observe as much as 30 % speedup. This translates into 23 % speedup on 12, 288 cores for a NAS FT implemented using FFTW.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of understanding the behavior of applications {{with respect to their}} performance, overhead, and scalability characteristics is knowledge of their execution control flow. High level knowledge of which functions or constructs were executed after which other constructs allows reasoning about <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> characteristics such as cache reuse. This paper describes an approach to capture and visualize the execution control flow of OpenMP applications in a compact way. Our approach does not require a full trace of program execution events but is instead based on a straightforward extension to the summary data already collected by an existing profiling tool. In multithreaded applications each thread may define its own independent flow of control, complicating both the recording as well as the visualization of the execution dynamics. Our approach allows for the full flexibility with respect to independent threads. However, the most common usage models of OpenMP have threads operate in a largely uniform way, synchronizing frequently at sequence points and diverging only to operate on different data items in worksharing constructs. Our approach accounts for this by offering a simplified representation of the execution control flow for threads with similar behavior...|$|E

40|$|Background: Transvenous {{catheter}} cryoablation {{is a novel}} {{technique for}} treating cardiac arrhythmias. However, {{the relative importance of}} <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> parameters on lesion dimension and clinical efficacy has not been studied. Methods and Results: We investigated the effects of (1) application duration: single 2. 5 (2. 5 x 1) versus single 5 versus double 2. 5 (2. 5 x 2) versus double 5 (5 x 2) minutes, (2) number of freeze-thaw cycles: single versus double, and (3) electrode contact area: horizontal versus vertical orientation, on the lesion diameter and depth during catheter cryoablation (10 F, 6. 5 -mm tip-electrode, CryoCor™, San Diego) in a thigh muscle preparation. A total of 175 lesions (horizontal = 90, vertical = 85) were created in thigh muscle preparations on 10 swine. The lesion diameter and depth were significantly greater using 2. 5 x 2 and 5 x 2 application modes as compared with 2. 5 x 1 applications (P 2. 5 minutes were independent predictors for lesion diameter (P 2. 5 minutes was an independent predictor for lesion depth (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The dimensions of lesions created by catheter cryoablation are affected by mode of cryoablation application and electrode orientation. Increasing the duration of application, employing multiple freeze-thaw cycles at shorter cycle durations, and orienting the catheter to enhance/increase tissue contact can create a larger lesion. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Laboratory and field studies were performed using the OP insecticide Trichlorphon. In the laboratory study, experimental groups of Gallotia galloti were treated with 5, 50 and 100 mg/kg of Trichlorphon, respectively, and after 24 h the following enzyme activities were assayed: brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE), serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), microsomal carboxylesterase (CbE) and microsomal 7 -ethoxyresorufin dealkylation (EROD). BChE activity was monitored in two groups of lizards treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of Trichlorphon, respectively, for a period of 21 and 31 days after treatment. In the field study, BChE activity was detected in Gallotia galloti specimens, 24 and 48 h after treatment of an experimental area with 10 kg/ha of Dipterex sp 80 (80 % Trichlorphon). Three conclusions can be drawn. (1) Gallotia galloti has the features of an ideal bioindicator: high sensitivity to OPs and extremely slow recovery of serum BChE with respect to other vertebrate species; this properly extends the <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> of this biomarker in field studies. (2) A high correlation was found between the destructive biomarker brain AChE and the nondestructive biomarker serum BChE, 24 h after treatment.

We argue that the combination of relational databases and temporal constraints offers a powerful framework which addresses these needs. In this thesis we develop the foundations of a theory of temporal constraint databases and indefinite temporal constraint databases. At first, we study a hierarchy of parameterized database models: ML -relational databases, L-constraint databases and indefinite L-constraint databases. The language L, the parameter, defines the constraint vocabulary and ML is the structure over which L-constraints will be interpreted. The models of temporal constraint databases and indefinite temporal constraint databases can then be studied as instances of the last two of the above parameterized models.

40|$|Summary: One of the mantras of European Community Law is {{that which}} defi nes it as “[…] a new legal order of {{international}} law […]”. 1 Like every mantra, this one has become a quasi-compulsory quote {{at the opening of}} every other treatise on EC law. If we take the Van Gend statement as our starting point, how is the “new legal order” doing in the new Member States, some two years after accession? This paper consists of three parts. The fi rst part discusses current “European” case law in national courts, giving examples of the use of EC law before domestic courts. Special attention is paid to cases which “made it to Luxembourg”, i. e. references for preliminary rulings from the new Community courts. The second part of the paper focuses on three particular areas that are currently of great importance to the smooth application of EC law in the new Member States: issues concerning the <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> of EC law and inter-temporal arrangement; the problem of the lack of due publication of EC law provisions in the languages of the new Member States; and the question of who is supposed to be acquainted with, and raise points about, Community law before a court. The third part of the paper makes some generalisations about the current and future application of EC law in Central Europe. The focus of this paper is limited: our area of territorial analysis will be the “Visegrad states”, i. e. the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Poland and Hungary. 2 Of these four, the greatest attention will be paid to the current situation in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|At present credits are an {{inevitable}} foreign source of financing. For starting entrepreneurs {{it is often}} {{the only way of}} acquiring some funds in order to begin the business activity at all. In general, the credit is characterized as a return form of acquiring foreign external sources. It represents an economic relationship between the creditor and debtor which is formed when the particular value is handed over for <b>temporal</b> <b>application</b> on condition of the return. The formation of this relationship has an agreement character. The creditor gives debtor at disposal the certain value in money or goods and takes care of the debt administration. The debtor commits himself to clear off his debt in the stipulated date and form and also to pay the respective interest. From the aspect of the company obtaining financial sources in a credit form and from the viewpoint of a debtor an important role is attributed to conditions in which the given source is acquired. These conditions include mainly the creditor´s right for: returning a debt, interests from the debt. During the hundred years ´ development the number of credit forms and developing financial markets have been formed and followed by a variety of financial innovations. In this way, the new forms and variants of credits and credit instruments have been formed. Key words: credit, lending relationship, forms of financing. Credits forms in Slovakia The credit form is understood as a complex of features characterizing its external existence. The division of credit forms can be done from several aspects according to: subject which grants a credit, object which credits up a credit, forms of granting and crediting techniques, period, for which a credit is granted, way of guarantee, way of repayment and territorial sphere of action.

40|$|Bache (2000 : 235) {{illustrates}} what {{he refers}} to as specifying modification, i. e. the post-deictic (Halliday 1994 [1985]) or postdeterminer (Sinclair et al. 1990) function, with, amongst others, the example my former colleague. Although former can function as a post-deictic in contexts where it is opposed to latter, e. g. in the former example, in this particular example, former does not function as post-deictic. It does not provide secondary identificational information supplementing the deictic. Quite to the contrary, it modifies the information provided by the head. Its function is to assess the relation between that information and the referent (Author 1 & Author 2 2016 a, b) in terms of its <b>temporal</b> <b>application.</b> We argue in this paper that this function, which we have called âdesignation assessorâ, and which is not recognized in traditional functional analyses, applies not only to temporal adjectives such as former and future, but also to epistemic ones such as possible and probable, which Halliday (1994 : 183) lists as post-deictics. Here the assessment pertains to the hypothetical nature of the relation between referent and designation, e. g. the possible leader. For yet other adjectives, the assessment involves the precision of the match, e. g. a true friend, a proper village. In the linear order of the noun phrase, the designation assessor is found in the position immediately {{to the left of the}} head (and classifiers) it modifies, see Figure 1. Evidence for the position is provided by items such as prefix ex- and postmodifier to be, which have the same function and which occur next to the head/categorization. Whereas the post-deictic analysis predicts these adjectives to precede any epithets, our analysis predicts them to follow any epithets and only precede classifiers. In this papers, we test this prediction for six adjectives proper, true, future, former, possible and likely on data from the British National Corpus. We use two queries: the _AJ 0 X _N* (âthe followed by any adjective followed by X followed by any nounâ) and the X _AJ 0 _N* (âthe followed by X followed by any adjective followed by any nounâ), where X stands for the adjectives. For searches with fewer than 100 hits, we analyse exhaustive samples, for the other ones, we analyse random samples of 100 hits. The analysis involves two steps. First, we exclude any of the examples in which X functions as epithet. We use predicative alternation and gradability, which are possible for epithets only, as empirical tests. Secondly, we determine the function of _AJ 0, on the basis of formal characteristics, such as gradability, predicative alternation, coordination with other epithets or classifiers, and the traditional semantic characterizations of the functions. The data confirm our prediction: _AJ 0 consists of classifiers only for the first query; in the second query_AJ 0 can be epithets, post-deictics but no classifiers. As such, we provide evidence for an alternative analysis of adjectives like former and possible, as well as for the inclusion of designation assessor as a function in the English noun phrase.
