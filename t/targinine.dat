40|$|Uptake of arsenate and {{phosphate}} by Streptococcus faecalis 9790 {{is strictly}} dependent on concurrent energy metabolism and essentially unidirectional. <b>targinine</b> supports uptake only in presence of glycerol or related substances; glycerol {{is not directly}} involved in transport but depletes the cellular orthophosphate pool and thus relieves feedback inhibition of transport. Uptake of phosphate and arsenate is stimulated by K+ and by other permeant cations. The results suggest that electroneutrality is preserved by compensatory movement of either H+ or OH minus. Ionophores and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which prevent establishment of a proton motive force, block the accumulation of thiomethylgalactoside and of threonine but not that of arsenate or phosphate. We conclude that arsenate accumulation requires adenosine 5 '-triphosphate but is not driven by the proton-motive force. However, conditions and reagents that lower the cytoplasmic pH do inhibit accumulation of arsenate and phosphate, suggesting that uptake depends on {{the capacity of the}} cells to maintain a neutral or alkaline cytoplasm. We therefore propose that phosphate accumulation is an electroneutral exchange for OH driven by adenosine 5 '-triphosphate or by a metabolite thereof. Accumulation of aspartate and glutamate also requires adenosine 5 '-triphosphate but not the proton-motive force and may involve a similar mechanism...|$|E
