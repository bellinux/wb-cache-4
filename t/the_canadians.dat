5|$|Dispatched to France in February 1915, the Canadian Division {{was briefly}} {{initiated}} to trench warfare {{on the periphery}} of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle before being attached to the British 2nd Army under Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien in the Belgian town of Ypres. It was in front of Ypres on 22 April that <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> bore the brunt of the most furious German attack of the year. In the afternoon at 5.00 pm the Germans began heavy shelling of the French trenches and <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> and the French Algerian troops stationed next to them saw a fog traveling across no-mans land, covering the advance of German forces. The fog was chlorine gas, the first occasion in which this substance had been used in warfare. The Algerians broke and fled, suffering over 6,000 casualties in a matter of minutes and <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> were consequently forced to defend twice the length of their front line in the face of a new and deadly weapon. Although the Canadian Division held on for more than two days, much ground was lost and the division had themselves suffered over 50% casualties, nearly 6,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the strong}} {{resistance}} {{exhibited by the}} Chinese, <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> expected a tough fight as 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives {{as part of the}} second phase of the divisional plan. Yet with the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the Chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill 187 features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 Chinese were also killed. Indeed, the ease with which <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy Chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty-two months of fighting.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on the 28th Brigade's {{left flank}} the Shropshires met slight resistance, {{securing}} Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 10:10. They were then relieved by <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> by nightfall {{in preparation for}} the third phase of the operation. The brigade plan was now a day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by <b>the</b> <b>Canadians,</b> overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan. However, determined to hold on following the loss of Hill 355, the Chinese moved in fresh troops, heavily reinforcing a number of positions, including Maryang San.|$|E

5|$|On 4 July, the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade and an {{attached}} {{battalion of}} the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked Carpiquet, {{supported on the}} flanks by the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. The village was captured by mid-afternoon but German resistance in the south defeated two attacks on the airfield, despite significant Allied tank and air support. Next day <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> repulsed German counter-attacks and held the village, which served {{as a base for}} Operation Charnwood, a Second Army attack on Caen, involving the rest of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division on 8 July and the airfield was captured by <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} games of the series were held in Canada and the final four in Moscow. The Soviet Union {{surprised}} the Canadian team {{and most of the}} hockey media with an opening game victory, 7–3. Many sportswriters had predicted an overwhelming victory for Canada in the series. Canada won the next game 4–1; the third game was a tie and the Soviets won game four to take a two games to one lead after the Canadian segment. The series resumed two weeks later in Moscow. The Soviets won game five to take a three games to one series lead. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> won the final three games in Moscow to win the series four games to three, with one tie. The final game was won in dramatic fashion, with <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> overcoming a two-goal Soviet lead after two periods. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> scored three in the third, the final one scored with 34 seconds left, by Paul Henderson.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron still had to watch for anti-aircraft artillery. The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February, {{while waiting for the}} Canadian push through the Reichwald. Although there was some aerial fighting, the major conflict with the Luftwaffe occurred when <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|At 07:30 on 15 December, two {{companies}} of the Carleton and York Regiment attacked. After {{little more than}} an hour of fighting, however, <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> were forced to call the attack off. In the afternoon, the two heavily depleted companies of the Royal 22e Régiment fought off a large German counterattack on Casa Berardi, with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery firing 5,398 rounds in support of Canadian forces.|$|E

5|$|At the ten-minute mark, Sinden {{noticed that}} the Soviets had changed their style, playing defence to protect the lead, rather than pressing. However, the {{strategy}} back-fired on the Soviets. The change in tactics gave <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> more chances to score and Cournoyer scored to even it up.|$|E
5|$|By 16 December, the British 5th Division had {{completed}} its {{move into the}} line between the New Zealand and the Indian divisions. There followed a period of hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the XIII Corps front. The main burden of the fighting was therefore assumed by V Corps as <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> pushed for Ortona with the Indian Division on their left flank attacking toward Villa Grande and Tollo.|$|E
5|$|Hockey Canada and the Soviet Hockey Federation met in Prague in April 1972 {{during the}} IIHF World Ice Hockey Championships. The two sides {{agreed on the}} terms: four games in Canada, {{to be held in}} Montreal (Montreal Forum), Toronto (Maple Leaf Gardens), Winnipeg (Winnipeg Arena), and Vancouver (Pacific Coliseum) and four games in the Soviet Union, all of them to be held in Moscow at the Luzhniki Ice Palace. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> agreed to hold the series in September and play the games under {{international}} rules. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series, and European referees in the Moscow games. The refereeing would use the international two referee system, not the one referee, two linemen system in place in the NHL, and, at the time, being introduced into international play. The Canadian side agreed to the terms under the belief that <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> would have no difficulty winning under any set of conditions. Joe Kryczka, president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), who was present at the negotiations, felt however, that the Soviets had demanded the concessions for their own benefit, believing that their team was already equal to any NHL team. The NHL later requested dates in October or November but the idea was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} lest {{he and his}} men should be engaged when they reached the Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the Australians, the Canadian fire did not hit them. This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E
5|$|Sinden made {{changes for}} the third period. He benched Awrey and the Jean Ratelle line, going with three lines. In the third, Clarke scored to bring Canada within one. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> {{attempted}} to get the equalizer, and Yvan Cournoyer put a puck off the post, but the Soviets broke out afterwards and Boris Mikhailov scored on the counter-attack to restore the two-goal lead with six minutes to play. Mikhailov skated across the Canadian net about 20 feet out, lured Dryden away from the net, then back-handed the puck into the net between his legs. The strategy of three lines, combined with the heat in the arena, had left <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> exhausted by then and the Soviets scored twice in the final minutes to finish with a 7–3 victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{additional}} artillery units {{immediately went}} to work hampering German consolidation, by shelling their front and support lines and seeking out hostile batteries. The Germans sprung a surprise on <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> by exploding four large mines under trenches of the 2nd Canadian Division covering the spur at the eastern outskirts of the ruins of Hooge and a company of the Canadian 28th (North West) Battalion was wiped out in the explosions. <b>The</b> <b>Canadians</b> managed to hold their position and prevent the Germans from reaching their support line but Byng ultimately {{decided to leave the}} Hooge trenches in German hands and to concentrate on regaining Mount Sorrel and Tor Top. To dissuade the Germans from more attacks on the left flank of the Canadian Corps, the dismounted British 2nd Cavalry Brigade came on loan to the Canadian Corps as a counter-attack force.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, despite poor flying weather, {{an effort}} was made to air-drop {{ammunition}} to the Polish force on the ridge. Learning that <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> had resumed their push and were making for Point 239, at 07:00 a platoon of the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron reconnoitered the German positions below the Zameczek.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the arms}} of the encirclement had now made contact, the Allies were not yet astride Seventh Army's escape route in any great {{strength}} and their positions came under frenzied assault. During the day an armoured column from the 2nd Panzer Division broke through <b>the</b> <b>Canadians</b> in St. Lambert, capturing half the village and maintaining an open road for six hours until being forced out. Many Germans escaped along this route and numerous small parties infiltrated on foot through to the River Dives during the night.|$|E
5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives.
