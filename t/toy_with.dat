5|$|Despite Paramount's {{failure to}} build a {{national}} broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, and executives at Paramount continued to <b>toy</b> <b>with</b> the idea of entering the television medium once more. Paramount sold its library of shorts and cartoons in separate deals to U.M. & M. TV Corporation, Associated Artists Productions and Harvey Comics (the Superman cartoons were already sold to National Comics when Paramount's license to Superman expired). In 1957, Paramount sold most of its pre-1950 sound live action feature film library to EMKA, Ltd., a subsidiary of MCA. The live action films would end up with what became Universal Television after MCA bought Universal Pictures in 1962. KTLA was eventually sold to Golden West Broadcasters, a company owned by actor and singer Gene Autry, for $12 million in 1964.|$|E

25|$|Other {{aspects of}} the game's {{interface}} were set to replicate {{the feel of a}} physical game being watched by an audience: Hearthstone starts with the player opening a box, during gameplay the cards waver and move while in their hand, and cards when played slam down on the board. When attacking, cards leap across the board to strike the target; when a massive spike of damage is dealt, the board shakes; when a massive creature is summoned, an unseen audience gasps in awe. Hearthstone also offers interactive boards. The boards on which the cards are played can be interacted with in various ways, such as virtually petting a dragon, although the feature is purely for entertainment and has no effect on gameplay. This idea came out from the movie Jumanji in which a board game comes to life, and also mimics how physical card players would often <b>toy</b> <b>with</b> their cards while waiting on their opponent.|$|E

500|$|The episode's main villain, the human-bat hybrid, was {{inspired}} by the 1970s comic book villain, Man-Bat, one of the arch-nemeses of Batman.

Furthermore, the episode was the first to test Doggett's skepticism of paranormal activity.
