5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect on the evolution of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place,</b> spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|On {{the episode}} of Nitro after Fall Brawl, Riggs and Bagwell won the World Tag Team Championship after {{defeating}} then-champions Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) in an upset win in an impromptu match. The American Males {{had been scheduled}} to face The Blue Bloods, but Harlem Heat attacked both members of the Blue Bloods prior to the match and volunteered <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> As champions, the pair defeated Harlem Heat and the team of Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. However, Bagwell and Riggs lost the titles back to Harlem Heat one week later on Saturday Night. The American Males remained top challengers for the title belts for the rest of 1995 but were unable to regain the championship from Harlem Heat.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two days}} later, on Sunday 18 June, the Duke of Wellington {{positioned}} his Anglo-allied army along a ridge {{near the village}} of Waterloo, in order to block Napoleon's advance along the road to Brussels. The Brunswick Corps formed part of Wellington's reserve corps, under his personal command. In that capacity, they were kept well behind the crest of the ridge and avoided casualties during the opening French bombardment. In {{the early part of the}} afternoon, the British Foot Guards moved down the slope to reinforce the Château d'Hougoumont, which was under fierce French attack; the Brunswick Corps was brought forward <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Part of these old horse trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E
5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E
25|$|New {{industries}} such {{as information}} technology and financial services are largely centred in Sydney and have risen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place,</b> with many companies having their Australian headquarters in Sydney CBD.

25|$|As {{the bison}} {{disappeared}} from the Canadian west, cattle ranches moved in <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Ranchers {{were among the most}} successful early settlers. The arid prairies and foothills were well suited to American-style, dry-land, open-range ranching. Black American cowboy John Ware brought the first cattle into the province in 1876. Like most hired hands, Ware was American, but the industry was dominated by powerful British- and Ontario-born magnates such as Patrick Burns.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} reforms were mainly intended {{to rescue the}} capitalist system by providing a more rational framework in which it could operate. The banking system was made less vulnerable. The regulation {{of the stock market}} and the prevention of some corporate abuses relating to the sale of securities and corporate reporting addressed the worst excesses. Roosevelt allowed trade unions <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> in labor relations and created the triangular partnership between employers, employees and government.|$|E

25|$|Another {{trend that}} began {{during this period}} was the {{phenomenon}} of NRL clubs 'out-sourcing' competing teams, with several NRL clubs choosing not to field sides in this competition and rather field either merged entities (as in the St Marys Penrith Cougars and Balmain Ryde Eastwood Tigers, both formed with NSWRL Jim Beam Cup sides) or form agreements with another club <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> in the competition, those players being eligible for NRL selection, such as the agreement between Newtown Jets and Sydney Roosters for the 2006 season.|$|E
25|$|Each WAGGGS Member Organization chooses how it {{believes}} it can best promote these goals, {{taking into account}} its culture {{and the needs of}} its young people.

Other Member Organizations prefer to work with mixed groups to enable young women and young men equal partnership within their units. Some Organizations choose to mix co-educational and single sex approaches according to the age and the preferences of the young people.|$|E
25|$|American poetry, {{the poetry}} of the United States, arose first as efforts by colonists to add their voices to English poetry in the 17th century, well before the {{constitutional}} unification of the thirteen colonies (although before this unification, a strong oral tradition often likened to poetry existed among Native American societies). Unsurprisingly, most of the early colonists' work relied on contemporary British models of poetic form, diction, and theme. However, in the 19th century, a distinctive American idiom began to emerge. By the later part of that century, when Walt Whitman was winning an enthusiastic audience abroad, poets from the United States had begun <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> {{at the forefront of}} the English-language avant-garde.|$|E

25|$|If a goalkeeper {{is injured}} or sent off, a {{substitute}} goalkeeper has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place,</b> otherwise an outfield player {{must take the}} ejected keeper's place in goal. In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off, a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper (thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players). They then play {{the remainder of the}} match with nine outfield players. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their permitted substitutions for the match, an outfield player has to take the dismissed goalkeeper's place and wear the goalkeeper shirt.|$|E
25|$|Blood Omen {{introduces}} {{the land of}} Nosgoth, a fantasy setting dominated by humans and vampires. The health {{of the world is}} inextricably connected to the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices, each one protected and represented by a human guardian. These sorcerers collectively comprise the Circle of Nine, and if a member dies, a new guardian is culled <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place</b> by the Pillars. Hundreds of years prior to the events of the story, the Circle formed and sponsored the Sarafan, an order of monastic warriors devoted to eradicating the vampire race, and in the game's prologue, the vampire Vorador reacts vengefully by killing six of the guardians and defeating Malek, the Sarafan leader. Though the Sarafan disband, vampires continue to be persecuted.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s New South Wales has {{undergone}} an increasingly rapid {{economic and social}} transformation. Old industries such as steel and shipbuilding have largely disappeared, and although agriculture remains important, {{its share of the}} state's income is smaller than ever before. New industries such as information technology, education, financial services and the arts, largely centred in Sydney, have risen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>place.</b> Coal exports to China are increasingly important to the state's economy. Tourism has also become hugely important, with Sydney as its centre but also stimulating growth on the North Coast, around Coffs Harbour and Byron Bay. As aviation has replaced shipping, most new migrants to Australia have arrived in Sydney by air rather than in Melbourne by ship, and Sydney now gets the lion's share of new arrivals, mostly from Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.|$|E
