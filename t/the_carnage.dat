5|$|After Shinzaemon dies, Shinrokurō wanders through <b>the</b> <b>carnage.</b> He {{meets the}} hunter Koyata, {{who has made}} a miraculous {{recovery}} after being stabbed in the neck by Naritsugu. The two then make their separate ways out of the town. An epilogue states that the Shogun and his government covered up what really occurred, announcing that Naritsugu died of illness on the journey back to his lands. Twenty-three years later, the Tokugawa Shogunate would be overthrown with the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
5|$|One of the robbers, Eliso Lominadze, stole a teacher's uniform to {{disguise}} herself {{and came back}} to the square, gazing at <b>the</b> <b>carnage.</b> Fifty casualties lay wounded in the square along with the dead people and horses. The authorities stated that only three people had died, but documents in the Okhrana archives reveal that the true number was around forty.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in <b>the</b> <b>carnage</b> that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In 1275, Magnús Óláfsson's illegitimate son, Guðrøðr, led {{a revolt}} on Mann and {{attempted}} to establish himself as king. According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and {{early the next morning}} the revolt was crushed as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway. Guðrøðr may very well have been slain in the defeat, although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, states that he, his wife and his followers escaped <b>the</b> <b>carnage</b> to Wales.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is coincidentally in the area, {{taking a}} {{vacation}} in Maine. After stumbling upon <b>the</b> <b>carnage</b> in the grocery store, Scully telephones Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and describes the bizarre situation. Mulder tells Scully that the incident might {{be the result of}} witchcraft or sorcery. Scully, however, can find no physical evidence that might support his theory. Assisted by the local police, Scully reviews the store's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene, the only customer unaffected. Jack Bonsaint, the police chief, tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch. Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} from Gallipoli, the AIF was re-organised in Egypt. This saw the splitting of the veteran battalions to provide cadres for new battalions as the AIF's infantry divisions in Egypt were doubled. As {{a part of}} this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 47th Battalion, and the 4th Brigade became part of the Australian 4th Division. After a further period of training, in June 1916 the battalion sailed for France aboard the transport Transylvania. After landing at Marseilles, the 15th Battalion moved to northern France via rail to Beilleul, moving into the line around Bois Grenier for a brief period on 15 June. Amidst <b>the</b> <b>carnage</b> of the Battle of the Somme which was launched in July, the following month, the 15th Battalion was committed to fighting on the Western Front for the first time, entering the line around Pozières on 5 August, as the 4th Division relieved the shattered 2nd.|$|E

A lieutenant, he also witnessed the effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, {{as one of the first}} Americans to see the ruins of the city (later, as Senator, Hatfield opposed arms proliferation and the Vietnam War). After Japan, he served in French Indochina, where he witnessed firsthand the wealth divide between the peasant Vietnamese and the colonial French bourgeoisie. After his discharge, he spent one year at Willamette’s law school, but decided politics or teaching better suited him.|$|E
5|$|In Parenthesis (1937) by David Jones, {{in which}} he {{reflects}} on <b>the</b> <b>carnage</b> he witnessed in the First World War. Jones put a quotation from the Gododdin {{at the beginning of}} each of the seven sections of In Parenthesis. Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used Y Gododdin as the basis of his difficult but much-admired poem For the Fallen (1997), written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line 'Men went to Catraeth', using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of Y Gododdin are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheers’s Pink Mist (2012), an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan; the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play.|$|E
5|$|Tegettoff {{turned his}} ships {{back to the}} south to chase Suenson, who in turn altered course to try {{to cut off the}} Prussian gunboats. As Schwarzenberg turned, the {{distance}} closed to just over , and she came under fire from all three Danish vessels. Jylland and Hejmdal then shifted fire to Radetzky. The Prussian vessels remained on the disengaged side of the Austrian frigates, firing at the Danish vessels with little effect. One of the Austrian vessels scored a hit on Jylland that killed or wounded all the men in one of her gun crews. The crews of the guns on either side fled their positions at the sight of <b>the</b> <b>carnage</b> until one of the men returned, calling his comrades to join him. During this period of the battle, Schwarzenberg suffered multiple shell hits and was set afire three times. Her crew extinguished the first two, but the third, in her foretopsail, proved to be too difficult to fight.|$|E

5|$|However, {{when the}} marine {{catches up with}} Campbell in the central {{computer}} processing sector of the base, Campbell is mortally wounded and only has enough strength to say that Kelly has taken Campbell's BFG 9000 weapon before expiring. Kelly then begins to taunt the marine in a demonic voice. The marine eventually faces off with Kelly in the central computer core, revealing Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base. The marine is able to kill Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 before proceeding deeper under the Martian surface to Site 3, the archaeological dig site where the Soul Cube was unearthed. At the primary excavation site, the marine discovers the Hellmouth, defended by Hell's mightiest warrior, the Cyberdemon. Using the Soul Cube, the marine defeats the Cyberdemon in combat, and the Soul Cube then seals the Hellmouth. The ending cut scene shows the reinforcements from Earth arriving at the base to discover <b>the</b> <b>carnage.</b> They find the marine alive, but discover that Swann has died. They are, however, unable to locate Betruger, who in the final scene is shown in Hell, reincarnated as a dragon-like demon.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by <b>the</b> <b>carnage</b> of the airplane crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent. A Korean man, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), tells his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), in Korean that she should remain close to him at all times.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald is a {{painting}} by Matejko that portrays events {{from the history of}} Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the struggles of Eastern European principalities against Teutonic knights in general. In the center of the painting is the Lithuanian duke Vytautas (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. Vytautas holds a more prominent position in the painting than his cousin, Polish king Władysław Jagiełło (Jogaila), who is visible in the second plan, mounted, in the top right side. According to Scales and Zimmer, by focusing on Vytautas rather than Jagiełło, Matejko stressed the importance of Lithuania for Poland, and the value of cooperation between the two countries in the Polish–Lithuanian union. Others have noted that this placement likely was influenced by Matejko's reliance on the writings of Jan Długosz, who attributed greater importance to Vytautas than to Jagiełło, who, by some polish sources, commanded the battle. While Lithuanian sources claim that Vytautas The Great have got the very major role in the battle by actually commanding troops. In the skies above <b>the</b> <b>carnage,</b> Saint Stanislaus, a patron of Poland, overlooks the fighting.|$|E
