5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is off to}} Philadelphia to {{interview}} at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin {{in a state of}} indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E

25|$|According to the Vietnamese Legislation, {{the entire}} {{population}} owns the water resources and single users and organizations are legally allowed to use {{them in order to}} meet their daily life and production. Apart from that, they are obligated <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> responsible water use and are supposed to protect all water resources. Nevertheless, the management of water resources is uniformly organized by the state. The legal framework concerning the management of water resources in general and the irrigation framework in particular is quite complicated in structure. Mainly, there are two documents providing rules and regulations for the use of water resources for irrigation. These are the Law on Water Resources (from the year 1998) and the Law on Land (replaced 1993). Especially for irrigation, there is the ordinance for the Exploitation and Protection of Irrigation Works and there are different secondary regulations concerning water use and the protection of water resources. Besides, Vietnam has approved of and ratified different international conventions. The most important ones are the Ramsar convention (1989), the International Convention on Biodiversity (1993), the Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin (1195), the Basel Convention (1995), the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2002), the UN Framework on Climate Change (2002), the Kyoto Protocol on the Clean Development Mechanism (2002).|$|E

She is nearly run over as she confronts Will and Emma when they begin to go for a test drive in his spontaneously {{acquired}} Corvette. Terri tells Will {{to get out of the}} car and they get into an argument, which causes Emma to leave the scene. The words simmer down and Terri advises Will to return the car to the dealership, because he cannot afford it. Before leaving, she says that Emma will break Will's heart again and he'll return to her eventually. In [...] "The Substitute", Terri returns <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sick Will. They have sex, but the next day when she sees Will's substitute, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) at his apartment having a beer with him, she becomes suspicious and makes several snarky comments to Holly.

In the episode [...] "A Night of Neglect", Sue Sylvester recruits Terri for her [...] "League of Doom", a new group that Sue hopes will help her bring down Will and the glee club before they can compete in Nationals.

2500|$|On August 15, 2001, a jury awarded Idema $781,818 for {{property}} damage and $1 million for punitive damages. The award {{came after a}} jury decided that a property manager improperly sold some of his belongings while Idema was serving his fraud sentence. Two property managers were hired by Idema <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building that housed equipment for two of his businesses, Special Operations Exposition and Trade Show Inc., and Idema Combat Systems. According to the lawsuit, equipment was missing, damaged or destroyed, and holes were punched in {{the walls of the}} building. Idema sued both property managers and their wives on April 10, 2000, but everyone except for one property manager was later dropped from the suit. [...] Idema never collected the 1.8 million because the property manager that was found liable declared bankruptcy and Idema settled for 650,000 dollars that he obtained through law suits filed against insurance carriers. Idema's father was the insured.|$|E
