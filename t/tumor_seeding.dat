40|$|A {{deformable}} registration method is proposed to register a brain atlas with tumor-bearing brain scans.

PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present a case of <b>tumor</b> <b>seeding</b> in the omentum found in a female patient after previous transperitoneal robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy (RARN) for papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Two years after the robotic operation, the patient was diagnosed with cervical clear cell carcinoma and underwent radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy and omentectomy. A neoplastic omental nodule was incidentally identified intraoperatively. Pathological characteristics and immunohistochemistry revealed features of papillary RCC.

40|$|SummaryCells {{released}} from primary <b>tumors</b> <b>seed</b> metastases to specific organs by a nonrandom process, implying {{the involvement of}} biologically selective mechanisms. Based on clinical, functional, and molecular evidence, we show that the cytokine TGFβ in the breast tumor microenvironment primes cancer cells for metastasis to the lungs. Central to this process is the induction of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL 4) by TGFβ via the Smad signaling pathway. TGFβ induction of Angptl 4 in cancer cells that {{are about to enter}} the circulation enhances their subsequent retention in the lungs, but not in the bone. Tumor cell-derived Angptl 4 disrupts vascular endothelial cell-cell junctions, increases the permeability of lung capillaries, and facilitates the trans-endothelial passage of tumor cells. These results suggest a mechanism for metastasis whereby a cytokine in the primary tumor microenvironment induces the expression of another cytokine in departing tumor cells, empowering these cells to disrupt lung capillary walls and seed pulmonary metastases...|$|R
40|$|Background Cellular {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs), {{which are}} normally associated with leukocyte trafficking, {{have also been}} shown to play an essential role in tumor metastasis to non-CNS sites. However, the role played by CAMs in brain metastasis is largely unexplored. It is known that leukocyte recruitment to the brain is very atypical and that mechanisms of disease in peripheral tissues cannot be extrapolated to the brain. Here, we have established the spatiotemporal expression of 12 key CAMs in the initial phases of <b>tumor</b> <b>seeding</b> in 2 different models of brain metastasis. 	 Methods BALB/c or SCID mice were injected intracardially (10 5 cells/ 100 μL phosphate-buffered saline with either 4 T 1 -GFP or MDA 231 BR-GFP cells, respectively (n = 4 - 6 /group), and expression of the CAMs was determined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence colocalisation. 	 Results Endothelial expression of E-selectin, VCAM- 1, ALCAM, ICAM- 1, VLA- 4, and β 4 integrin was markedly increased early in <b>tumor</b> <b>seeding.</b> At the same time, the natural ligands to these adhesion molecules were highly expressed on the metastatic tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Two of these ligands showed particularly high tumor cell expression (ALCAM and VLA- 4), and consequently their functional role in <b>tumor</b> <b>seeding</b> was determined. Antibody neutralization of either ALCAM or VLA- 4 significantly reduced <b>tumor</b> <b>seeding</b> within the brain (> 60 % decrease in tumor number/mm 2 brain; P 	 Conclusions These findings suggest that ALCAM/ALCAM and VLA- 4 /VCAM- 1 interactions play an important functional role {{in the early stages of}} metastasis seeding in the brain.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{level of}} the thecal sac ending in unaffected individuals of young age-group and in patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>seeding</b> <b>tumor</b> using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

Sagittal MR images {{were used to determine}} the {{level of the}}cal sac ending by referencing on the corresponding vertebral body and intervertebral disc. Results: The range of the thecal sac ending level in unaffected population varied from the lower one-third of L 5 to the middle one-third of S 3.

40|$|International audienceElectrochemotherapy is an {{effective}} local treatment of solid tumors which combines delivery of chemotherapeutic drug and electric pulses. Electric pulses increase permeability of plasma membrane transiently and reversibly, leading to increased transport of the drug into the cell.

Electric pulses are delivered to tissue by electric pulses generator via electrodes. In general {{there are two types of}} electrodes, plate electrodes and needle electrodes. The target tissue, i. e. tumor, is to be positioned well in-between the electrodes. The electrodes should thus fit the size of the tumor for good electric field distribution.

Each site was asked to complete a 2 -page survey regarding the volume of laparoscopic urological procedures and port site recurrences. Results: Nineteen sites elected to participate. A total of 18, 750 laparoscopic procedures were performed, of which 10, 912 were for cancer. These included 2, 604 radical nephrectomies, 559 nephroureterectomies, 555 partial nephrectomies, 27 segmental ureterectomies, 3, 665 radical prostatectomies, 1, 869 pelvic lymph node dissections, 479 retroperitoneal lymph node dissections, 336 adrenalectomies and 108 procedures listed as other. <b>Tumor</b> <b>seeding</b> was reported in 13 cases (0. 1 %), including 3 nephroureterectomies for transitional cell carcinoma, 4 nephrectomies (incidental transitional cell carcinoma), 4 adrenalectomies for metastases, 1 retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer and 1 pelvic lymph node dissection for cancer of the penis.

40|$|Tumor {{cells that}} {{disseminate}} {{from the primary}} tumor and survive the vascular system can eventually extravasate across the endothelium to metastasize at a secondary site.

40|$|Late relapse {{of breast}} cancer can occur more than 25 years after primary diagnosis.

In this study, we applied a probabilistic mathematical model to long-term follow-up studies of postresection patients to investigate the factors involved in mediating breast cancer dormancy. Our results suggest that long-term dormancy is maintained most often by just one growth-restricted dangerous micrometastasis. Analysis of the empirical data by Approximate Bayesian Computation indicated that patients in dormancy have between 1 and 5 micrometastases at 10 years postresection, when they escape growth restriction with a half-life of 0. 4 mm in diameter. Before resection, primary <b>tumors</b> <b>seed</b> at most an average of 6 dangerous micrometastases that escape from growth restriction with a half-life of at least 12 years. Our findings suggest that effective preventive treatments will need to eliminate these small numbers of micrometastases, which may be preangiogenic and nonvascularized until they switch to growth due to one oncogenic mutation or tumor suppressor gene inactivation. In summary, breast cancer dormancy seems to be maintained by small numbers of sizeable micrometastases that escape from growth restriction with a half-life exceeding 12 years...|$|R

40|$|Targeted {{therapy in}} {{retinoblastoma}} (RB) is widely accepted {{as the current}} management tool with an aim of increasing drug availability at the tumor location. Inevitably the effect is several times higher compared to systemic delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and carries less systemic toxicity. Despite tremendous advancement in saving life, eye salvage in advanced RB especially with active vitreous seeds remains a challenge. The hypoxic environment of the vitreous and reduced vitreous concentration of the drugs delivered makes these <b>tumor</b> <b>seeds</b> resistant to chemotherapy. Direct delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs into the vitreous cavity aids to overcome these challenges and is progressively being accepted worldwide. However, intraocular procedure in RB was abandoned due to high risk of extraocular tumor dissemination. Recently, the forbidden therapeutic technique was re-explored and modified for safe use.
