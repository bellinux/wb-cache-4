25|$|Today, {{black bears}} are only legally hunted for sport in Japan and Russia. In Russia, 75–100 black bears are legally {{harvested}} annually, though 500 {{a year are}} reportedly harvested illegally. Russian sport hunting of black bears became legalised in 2004. According to a 2008 article written in The Sun, Russia's Slavic Hunting Club offers four day trips with four guaranteed black bear kills for the sum of £16,000. The article indicated <b>that</b> <b>clients</b> receiving permits for black bear hunts included people from Britain, the United States, Germany, Spain, Poland and Finland.|$|E

25|$|The Perspectives Project {{operates}} network notaries <b>that</b> <b>clients</b> can use {{to detect}} if a site's certificate has changed.

Use of network notaries from a multitude of perspectives {{makes it possible for}} a target to detect an attack even if a certificate appears to be completely valid.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. was {{the fifth}} largest {{investment}} bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through {{the second half of}} 2007. On Friday, March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns lost 47% of its equity market value to close at $30.00 per share as rumors emerged <b>that</b> <b>clients</b> were withdrawing capital from the bank. Over the following weekend, it emerged that Bear Stearns might prove insolvent, and on or around March 15, 2008, the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of Bear Stearns.|$|E

Madlada-Routledge was appointed a parliamentary caucus chair of the African National Congress in 2008 but left the following year to study Social Science at the University of Cape Town, graduating in 2010.

25|$|Documents under seal in {{a decade-long}} lawsuit {{concerning}} eToys.com's IPO but obtained by New York Times Wall Street Business columnist Joe Nocera alleged that IPOs managed by Goldman Sachs and other investment bankers involved asking for kickbacks from their institutional clients who made large profits flipping IPOs which Goldman had intentionally undervalued. Depositions {{in the lawsuit}} alleged <b>that</b> <b>clients</b> willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was {{necessary in order to}} participate in future hot issues. Reuters Wall Street correspondent Felix Salmon retracted his earlier, more conciliatory, statements on the subject and said he believed that the depositions show that companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice, which may be widespread throughout the IPO finance industry. The case is ongoing, and the allegations remain unproven.|$|E
25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these {{is the issue of}} power. In this regard there is a concern <b>that</b> <b>clients</b> are persuaded—both inside and outside the {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because it}} {{may not always be}} the case that a {{wrongdoing}} trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust. Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged for other things (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the new thing can potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given £22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for Sir Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a get-away to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Plumer, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown an investment manager wrongfully took £20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out £1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid out anyway. The majority of the House of Lords held <b>that</b> <b>clients</b> could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (£400,000). Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon unjust enrichment, as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.|$|E
