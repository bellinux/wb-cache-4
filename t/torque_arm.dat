25|$|GNX #001 is the 1986 {{prototype}} currently {{owned by}} Buick and sometimes makes appearances at car shows around the US. The GNX used a unique <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased traction. The <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> rear suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction.|$|E
25|$|Drum brakes provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum brake wheel requires the operator to disconnect the brake cable {{as well as}} the axle. They also require a <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the G/S {{name was}} changed to GS with the S meaning [...] "Sport" [...] rather than [...] "Straße" [...] and the Monolever was {{replaced}} with the Paralever swingarm, which included a <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> intended to lessen shaft effect and strengthen the swingarm-to-final drive connection.

50|$|The {{support arm}} carried all the load; the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> carried the {{accelerating}} and decelerating torque; the upper A-arm controlled the camber. Advantages claimed {{for the system}} included superior maintenance of wheel alignment from the wide spread of the lower A-arm, a permanent fixing of the caster angle, and an increased percentage of the braking force transmitted to the frame through the <b>torque</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{means for}} {{measuring}} torque is {{to mount the}} dynamometer housing {{so that it is}} free to turn except as restrained by a <b>torque</b> <b>arm.</b> The housing can be made free to rotate by using trunnions connected to each end of the housing to support it in pedestal-mounted trunnion bearings. The <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> is connected to the dyno housing and a weighing scale is positioned so that it measures the force exerted by the dyno housing in attempting to rotate. The torque is the force indicated by the scales multiplied by the length of the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> measured {{from the center of the}} dynamometer. A load cell transducer can be substituted for the scales in order to provide an electrical signal that is proportional to torque.|$|E

5000|$|Systems {{which require}} the torque {{of the system}} under test to be {{measured}} typically use a strain gauge mounted on a <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> that {{is attached to the}} housing perpendicular to the input shaft. The housing/stator is mounted on roller bearings and the rotor is mounted on roller bearings within the housing/stator so that it can turn independently of the rotor and frame. The strain gauge connects the <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> to the frame assembly and keeps the housing from spinning as housing tries to turn in the same direction of the turbine.

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal wheel control. One or more <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> may be added to provide supplementary wheel control, particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the wheels, improving wheel control on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to control wheel movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced wheel hop in hard stops.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} milestone 1941 Clipper {{rode the}} senior wheelbase of 127 in {{and used the}} One Twenty's [...] straight eight, but produced 125 bhp (five more than the One Twenty). Despite the familiar engine, few Clipper parts were interchangeable with other models. The chassis was entirely new: a double-drop frame allowed a lower floor without reducing road clearance. The engine was mounted well forward and the rear shocks were angled to assist the traditional Packard fifth shock in controlling side-sway. The front suspension was entirely new, since the lower frame eliminated the need for Packard's traditional long <b>torque</b> <b>arms.</b> A double-link connection between the Pitman arm and steering brackets, with a cross bar and idler arm and two cross tubes, controlled wheel movement.|$|R
50|$|A {{radius rod}} (also called a radius arm or a <b>torque</b> <b>arm)</b> is a {{suspension}} link intended to control wheel {{motion in the}} longitudinal (fore-aft) direction. The link is connected (with a rubber or solid bushing) on {{one end to the}} wheel carrier or axle, on the other to the chassis or unibody of the vehicle. Radius rods are also sometimes used in aircraft with fixed (non retractable) undercarriages.|$|E
50|$|The Honda RC30 had a 'Pro Squat Rear Brake Linkage' {{that linked}} the rear caliper {{to the frame}} via a linkage through the swingarm, {{reducing}} rear wheel hop under braking. The NC30 had the swingarm machined to allow a <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> shaft and featured the cast boss on the frame but the linkage was not fitted and the caliper was instead held in place with a simple torque reaction arm bolted into the swingarm.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} parts to an {{electromagnetic}} brake: field, armature, and hub (which is the input on a brake) (A-3). Usually {{the magnetic field}} is bolted to the machine frame (or uses a <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> that can handle the torque of the brake). So when the armature is attracted to the field the stopping torque is transferred into the field housing and into the machine frame decelerating the load. This can happen very fast (.1-3sec).|$|E

50|$|The {{axle track}} {{provides}} {{the resistance to}} lateral weight transfer and body lean. The wheelbase provides resistance to longitudinal weight transfer and to pitch angular inertia, and provides the <b>torque</b> lever <b>arm</b> to rotate the car when swerving. The wheelbase, however, {{is less important than}} angular inertia (polar moment) to the vehicle's ability to swerve quickly.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring scale}} {{measures}} weight by reporting {{the distance that}} a spring deflects under a load. This contrasts to a balance, which compares the <b>torque</b> on the <b>arm</b> due to a sample weight to the <b>torque</b> on the <b>arm</b> due to a standard reference weight using a horizontal lever. Spring scales measure force, which is the tension force of constraint acting on an object, opposing the local force of gravity. They are usually calibrated so that measured force translates to mass at earth's gravity. The object to be weighed can be simply hung from the spring or set on a pivot and bearing platform.|$|R
5000|$|Backstopping {{prevents}} {{a loaded}} inclined conveyor from running {{back when the}} drive system is stopped. The outer race of the sprag clutch is fixed to the machine frame, usually via a <b>torque</b> <b>arm.</b> The inner race rotates freely in the forward direction of the conveyor drive. When the machine tries to run backward, the sprag clutch prevents this motion. In this application the sprag clutch is often called a [...] "backstop" [...] or [...] "holdback".|$|E
50|$|Scheidegger {{was killed}} while leading a race at Mallory Park in 1967. Scheidegger's BMW outfit crashed {{at high speed}} at Shaw's Corner after a {{defective}} bracket holding both the rear brake <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> and the gear change cross shaft failed. At the following inquest, it was also disclosed that the bracket had not been properly brazed and that it's brazing had been cracked for some considerable time. John Robinson suffered a broken leg and retired from the sport.|$|E
5000|$|A more {{expensive}} track-day {{version of the}} BMW R1100S, the BoxerCup Replika (or [...] "BCR"), was available from 2003-2005. The BCR had twin Laser under-seat exhausts, braided brake lines, carbon-fibre cylinder head protectors, a carbon-fibre oil-catcher bellypan, uprated Öhlins suspension, and a shorter paralever <b>torque</b> <b>arm</b> which raised the rear end to quicken the steering and increase cornering clearance. [...] Later BoxerCup and Sport models had matte black engines, with the cylinders and cylinder heads remaining silver.|$|E
40|$|In a space telerobotic service scenario, {{cooperative}} {{motion and}} force control of multiple robot arms are of fundamental importance. Three paradigms {{to study this}} problem are proposed. They are distinguished by the set of variables used for control design. They are joint <b>torques,</b> <b>arm</b> tip force vectors, and an accelerated generalized coordinate set. Control issues related to each case are discussed. The latter two choices require complete model information, which presents practical modeling, computational, and robustness problems. Therefore, {{focus is on the}} joint torque control case to develop relatively model independent motion and internal force control laws. The rigid body assumption allows the motion and force control problems to be independently addressed. By using an energy motivated Lyapunov function, a simple proportional derivative plus gravity compensation type of motion control law is always shown to be stabilizing. The asymptotic convergence of the tracing error to zero requires the use of a generalized coordinate with the contact constraints taken into account. If a non-generalized coordinate is used, only convergence to a steady state manifold can be concluded. For the force control, both feedforward and feedback schemes are analyzed. The feedback control, if proper care has been taken, exhibits better robustness and transient performance...|$|R
40|$|Vibrational energy {{harvesters}} (VEH) are one way {{to generate}} electricity. Though the energy quantities are not enough to run desktop computers, they can power remote devices such as temperature, pressure, and accelerometer sensors or power biological implants. New versions of the Bluetooth protocol can even be used with VEH technology to send wireless data. An important aspect of VEH devices is the power output, operating frequency, and bandwidth. This dissertation investigates a novel method of actuating the primary buckled energy harvesting structure using <b>torque</b> <b>arms</b> as a force amplification mechanism. Buckled structures can exhibit snap-through and {{has the potential to}} broaden the operating frequency for the VEH. Macro and MEMS size prototypes are fabricated and evaluated via a custom made shaker table. The effect of compliance arms, which pin the center beam with piezoelectric strips, are also evaluated along with damping ratios. ANSYS models evaluating generated power are created for use in future optimization studies. Lastly, high energy orbitals (HEO) are observed in the devices. Results show that buckling lowers and broadens the output power of the new devices. Reverse sweeps drastically increase the operating frequency during snap-through. Rectangular compliance arms made of poly-lactic acid (PLA) generated the most power of all compliance arms tested. HEO performance can be induced by perturbing the system while maintaining the same input force which increases power output...|$|R

The main aim {{of this paper is}} to support the concept studies and research for large offshore wind turbines by providing a baseline gearbox model with detailed modeling parameters. This baseline gearbox follows the most conventional design types of those used in wind turbines. It is based on the four-point supports: two main bearings and two <b>torque</b> <b>arms.</b> The gearbox consists of three stages: two planetary and one parallel stage gears. The gear ratios among the stages are calculated in a way to obtain the minimum gearbox weight. The gearbox components are designed and selected based on the offshore wind turbine design codes and validated by comparison to the data available from large offshore wind turbine prototypes. All parameters required to establish the dynamic model of the gearbox are then provided. Moreover, a maintenance map indicating components with high to low probability of failure is shown. The 5 MW reference gearbox can be used as a baseline for research on wind turbine gearboxes and comparison studies. It can also be employed in global analysis tools to represent a more realistic model of a gearbox in a coupled analysi...|$|R
