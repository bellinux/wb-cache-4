5|$|The Australian Team's {{performance}} {{was affected by}} the death of para-snowboarder Matthew Robinson just prior to <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> <b>and</b> injuries to Cameron Rahles-Rahbula and Joany Badenhorst forcing them to withdraw from their events.|$|E
5|$|Andorra {{made its}} début in the Summer Paralympics, having already made three {{appearances}} at the Winter Paralympics. Malawi, {{which would have}} been making its debut at <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> <b>and</b> Botswana, were both due to send delegations but withdrew hours before the opening ceremony citing a lack of government funds.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E
25|$|Lara won {{the skills}} {{competition}} preceding <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> Sands homered in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> {{was selected as}} its Most Valuable Player.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{reception}} of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was positive, with critics {{surprised by the}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> protagonist Tembo. Comparisons were drawn between <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sonic the Hedgehog series.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} Voodoo Vince is told {{through the course}} of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> manual, which reveals the names of some of the {{characters}} in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> has bios of <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> main characters.|$|R
5|$|As in {{previous}} generations, Nintendo provided {{strong support for}} its new console with popular first-party franchises like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokémon, among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games, consisting of Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, and Wii Music, where players {{make use of the}} motion-sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities. With the exception of Wii Music, <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> their sequels have all been highly successful.|$|E
5|$|As {{the torch}} bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, {{picks up the}} torch, and completes the run to light the Olympic Flame. The heat of the flame and the emotion of the crowd power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch <b>the</b> <b>games,</b> <b>and</b> Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Many of those in {{attendance}} had come to see the explosion rather than <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Eddie Mathews {{scored the}} first run of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> later hit his league-leading 46th home run, but his Braves {{ultimately}} lost <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pennant 6-5 in extra innings.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} pyramids to start <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> one more is added every round thereafter.The team that {{gets all the}} pyramid pieces wins <b>the</b> challenge, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grand prize trip.|$|R
50|$|The Times {{correspondent}} {{was very}} disappointed with <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> felt <b>the</b> one all score line fair. The Guardian was much more enthusiastic <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> in particular about Barnsleys play and felt they should have won.|$|R
5|$|Early Games {{were not}} clearly {{documented}} {{with respect to}} participating nations. Competitors from 11 to 16 different nations participated in the inaugural 1896 Games, in Athens. Eleven nations (Australia, Austria, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) are mentioned in the official report for <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> <b>and</b> the International Olympic Committee (IOC) states that 14 nations were represented.|$|E
5|$|Held at a {{price of}} C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics cost more to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter. The high cost was anticipated, as organizers were aware {{at the outset of}} their bid that most facilities would have to be constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> <b>and</b> were planned to become the home of several of Canada's national winter sports teams.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, a {{month before}} the game's {{scheduled}} release, LucasArts signed a worldwide agreement with Nintendo concerning three new Star Wars video games. It granted Nintendo the rights to market <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> hold exclusive, worldwide distribution rights for five years following each release. Rogue Squadron was the first game released under this agreement.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} streetball {{feature is}} having an MC call <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> <b>The</b> MC is on the court during <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> is often {{very close to the}} players (but makes an effort to not interfere with <b>the</b> <b>game)</b> <b>and</b> uses a microphone to provide <b>game</b> commentary for <b>the</b> fans.|$|R
50|$|An {{editorial}} in the May/June 2006 Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine brought attention to <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> its risk of concussion. The teenagers also frequently video tape <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> post <b>the</b> videos to video sharing websites like Myspace or YouTube.|$|R
50|$|IGN praised <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> {{compared}} it to Interplay's first DSi game—one of familiar theme and positive reviews: Prehistorik Man. Nintendo Life lamented <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> bugs, glitches, <b>and</b> lackluster artificial intelligence. Official Nintendo Magazine UK similarly criticized <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> bugs <b>and</b> glitches.|$|R
5|$|In addition, the {{hospitality}} sector received a major boost {{due to the}} games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who were coming to see the Games - media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> <b>and</b> the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city. Many famous places such as the Charminar and the Chowmahalla Palace saw record number of visitors.|$|E
5|$|It {{was agreed}} for a {{secondary}} Olympic Flame to be lit in Torquay during <b>the</b> <b>games,</b> <b>and</b> a secondary torch relay {{was conducted to}} take the flame from Wembley south to the coast to Torquay. The arrangements {{were the same as}} from Dover to Wembley but in reverse.|$|E
5|$|Mysts effects {{extended}} {{to those who}} played <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> technology. The title was widely credited {{as one of the}} first games to appeal not just to hardcore gamers but to casual players and demographics that generally did not play games, such as women. Mysts lack of conventional game elementsviolence, dying, and failureappealed to nongamers and those contemplating buying a computer. The Millers' decision to develop Myst for the nascent CD-ROM format helped boost interest and adoption of disc drives.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{inspector}} Kevin Klapper, an ex-football addict, {{has come}} for a random inspection. He disapproves of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> writes a scathing report. He too succumbs to the lure of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> stalls, ignoring his job to help coach the team.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{position}} player bats for a pitcher, {{you have to}} remove the pinch hitter from <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> replace him with another pitcher. There's no way to take another person out of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> put <b>the</b> pinch hitter in his spot.|$|R

5|$|On 4 March 2014, he {{was named}} as the Australian flag bearer at the 2014 Winter Paralympics Opening Ceremony. Less than a day after being named as flag bearer, he {{suffered}} a knee fracture and ankle injury in a training accident and {{was not able to}} compete in any of his events. He {{played an important role in}} supporting the Australian Team during <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> <b>and</b> announced that he was retiring.|$|E
5|$|Players can gamble. They {{can do this}} {{by visiting}} casinos, buying chips with the three major {{currencies}} in <b>the</b> <b>games,</b> <b>and</b> playing either blackjack, slots, or roulette within them. Players can also play a card game called Caravan, which was specifically designed for the game and has its own rules, and can be played with certain people outside of the casinos.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian city of Innsbruck was {{the host}} in 1964. Although Innsbruck was a {{traditional}} winter sports resort, warm weather caused {{a lack of}} snow during <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> <b>and</b> the Austrian army was asked to transport snow and ice to the sport venues. Soviet speed-skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by sweeping all four speed-skating events. Her career total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes. Luge was first contested in 1964, although the sport received bad publicity when a competitor {{was killed in a}} pre-Olympic training run.|$|E

50|$|Southwestern began {{quickly with}} an opening {{touchdown}} 58 seconds into <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> held <b>the</b> lead until a last second pass found {{the end zone}} for Friends. Southwestern's penalties on the final drive of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> four-yard pass from Jayme Bristow to Josh Womack sealed <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with only 11 seconds left on the clock.|$|R
50|$|The match {{officials}} {{decided to}} stop <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> have <b>the</b> stadium cleared of all fans. 75 minutes went by, and 100+ Olympiacos fans had still not vacated the stadium, so <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> series was officially called off. A technicality win of 0-20 was granted to Panathinaikos, despite there still being 01:27 left on <b>the</b> <b>game</b> clock.|$|R
5|$|The God of War novels {{recount the}} events of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> offer deeper {{insights}} into their stories. God of War, the official novelization of {{the first game of}} the series, was written by Matthew Stover and Robert E. Vardeman. It was published on May 25, 2010, by Del Rey Books. God of War II, the second novelization of the series, was written by Vardeman alone and was published by Del Rey Books on February 12, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The film follows Alice {{searching for}} and rescuing the {{remaining}} survivors in Los Angeles after the T-virus outbreak, and teaming up against Albert Wesker, {{the head of}} the Umbrella Corporation. Chris Redfield, a primary character from the video games, was featured {{for the first time in}} the film franchise. Other characters from <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>and</b> films who returned are: Claire Redfield, Chris's sister who has lost her memory prior to the film's events; Albert Wesker, the film's main antagonist; and Jill Valentine, who made a cameo appearance.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-two nations earned {{medals at}} <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> <b>and</b> {{nineteen}} won {{at least one}} gold medal. Antigua and Barbuda and El Salvador won their first ever gold medals. The Netherlands Antilles, the Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, the Cayman Islands, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Saint Lucia improved {{their position in the}} general medal table compared to the 2003 Pan American Games, held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.|$|E
40|$|Serious games- {{games that}} are {{intended}} to educate in addition to simply entertain- can be a valuable asset {{in an effort to}} educate teenagers and young adults, who prefer learning through programs that they can control, such as video games (Corriveau, Shi, 2010). In this thesis we present the development of this mobile multi-platform serious game intended to teach the basic information about asthma to teenagers and young adults. We review the design of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mobile technologies used to create <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> We present conclusions based on observations made while interviewees played <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> detail <b>the</b> changes made to <b>the</b> <b>game</b> based on these observations. Each interviewee also provided feedback on <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> completed several assessments to measure their knowledge of asthma before <b>and</b> after playing <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> We review <b>the</b> knowledge each interviewee gained from the interaction with <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> draw and present conclusions based on the background each subject comes from. i II.
