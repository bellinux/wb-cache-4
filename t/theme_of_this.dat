5|$|Other {{members of}} this {{earliest}} generation of heroes such as Perseus, Deucalion, Theseus and Bellerophon, have many traits in common with Heracles. Like him, their exploits are solitary, fantastic and border on fairy tale, as they slay monsters such as the Chimera and Medusa. Bellerophon's adventures are commonplace types, similar to the adventures of Heracles and Theseus. Sending a hero to his presumed death is also a recurrent <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> early heroic tradition, used {{in the cases of}} Perseus and Bellerophon.|$|E
5|$|II. Adagio in A-flat major, A–B–A–B–A form. Nostalgic in its {{traditional}} classical character (one {{of the few}} instrumental adagios Schubert wrote), the opening <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> movement is an elegant, touching melody that eventually undergoes remarkable tonal and cadential treatment, undermining the peaceful setting. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} the voice-leading of the first phrase, 1–7–1–2–3–4–3, is based on the initial A-flat digression {{in the beginning of the}} Allegro. The unorthodox, chromatic harmonic structure of this movement is generated from a short progression that appears towards the end of the A section, leading to a plagal cadence in the subdominant key (D-flat), chromatically colored with its own minor subdominant chord (G-flat minor). The importance of this progression and of D-flat in general is emphasized by its quotation in a climax of the finale's exposition. This diversion of the main theme's expected cadence leads to the haunted atmosphere of the B section, which is full of chromatic modulations and startling sforzandos. In the second appearance of the A and B sections, almost the entire music is shifted a semitone up, further cementing the importance of the ascending minor 2nd in the sonata as a whole. The focal plagal progression returns transformed at the end of the movement, with even subtler chromatic coloration and more distant modulations, touching on C major, before the piece finally ends in the tonic, the theme now weakened and given an illusory quality due to the evasion of cadences, free modulation, and tendency toward digression into troubled minor passages.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographical}} <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{region is}} shaped by rolling hills, Great Lakes shorelines including coastal dunes on the west coast, large inland lakes, numerous rivers and large forests. A tension zone is identified running from Muskegon to Saginaw Bay marked by a change in soil type and common tree species. North of the line the historic presettlement forests were beech and sugar maple, mixed with hemlock, white pine, and yellow birch which only grew on moist soils further south. Southern Michigan forests were primarily deciduous with oaks, red maple, shagbark hickory, basswood and cottonwood which are uncommon further north. Northern Michigan soils tend to be coarser, and the growing season is shorter with a cooler climate. Lake effect weather brings significant snowfalls to snow belt areas of Northern Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{until the}} late 20th century {{emphasised}} class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution. The central <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, {{with support from the}} sans-culottes, who fought to destroy the aristocracy. However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support. Nevertheless, as Spang has shown, there persists a very widespread agreement to the effect that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of Western history.|$|E

500|$|Vacancy {{diffusion}} {{can occur}} as the predominant method of surface diffusion at high coverage levels approaching complete coverage.

[...] Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop praised the episode for having [...] "a refreshing {{change from the}} usual <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> series", with Rhys' performance and the sub plot of the Sugarhorse story arc adding [...] "definitely {{one of the best}} stories so far in what has been an impressive series, if a little heavy on the Islamic terrorist side at times.

You know, a dog and its owner and they both were separated, but they love each other so much — there's such an emotional payoff when these characters get reunited, and I think that's what this song's about." [...] Lasseter thought that solely the song worked, but it worked better for the film. [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] {{is one of two}} songs on the Bolt soundtrack and was released to Radio Disney to promote Bolt and its accompanying soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Espenson {{said that}} this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they {{realized}} {{it was going to be}} airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to [...] "lean into" [...] this theme. Unusual for Once Upon a Time, the <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode changed during the writing process. It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love. However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he is doing this, but really his actions are motivated by not believing that he is worthy of love at all. In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle. Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and [...] "preserve as much as we could of the fairy tale side," [...] as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.|$|E
