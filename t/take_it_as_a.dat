The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E

25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E
25|$|Shen Teh is {{rewarded for}} her hospitality, as the gods <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{sure sign of}} goodness. They give her money and she buys a humble tobacco shop which they intend as both gift and test: will Shen Teh be able to {{maintain}} her goodness with these newfound means, however slight they may be? If she succeeds, the gods' confidence in humanity would be restored. Though at first Shen Teh seems {{to live up to the}} gods' expectations, her generosity quickly turns her small shop into a messy, overcrowded poorhouse which attracts crime and police supervision. In a sense, Shen Teh quickly fails the test, as she is forced to introduce the invented cousin Shui Ta as overseer and protector of her interests. Shen Teh dons a costume of male clothing, a mask, and a forceful voice to take on the role of Shui Ta. Shui Ta arrives at the shop, coldly explains that his cousin has gone out of town on a short trip, curtly turns out the hangers-on, and quickly restores order to the shop.|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} main {{traditional}} accounts of vagueness : one <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> genuinely metaphysical phenomenon, one <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> phenomenon of ignorance, and one <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> linguistic or conceptual phenomenon. In this paper I first very briefly present these views, especially the epistemicist and supervaluationist strategies, and shortly point to some well-known {{problems that the}} views carry. I then examine a 'statistical epistemicist' account of vagueness {{that is designed to}} avoid precisely these problems – it will be a view that provides an account of the phenomenon of vagueness as coming from our linguistic practices, while insisting that meaning supervenes on use, and that our use of vague terms does yield sharp and precise meanings, which we ignore, thus allowing bivalence to hold...|$|R

In 2011, Kajol participated in a fashion show organised by the Cancer Patients Aid Association, to generate funds for the organisation.

The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape.

500|$|Steinbrenner named Lemon the team's {{field manager}} {{a second time}} on September 6, 1981, the sixth Yankees' manager change since 1978. Lemon {{moved on to the}} post-season and {{dispatched}} the Milwaukee Brewers and the Billy Martin-led Oakland Athletics, and won the first two games of the 1981 World Series against the Dodgers, only to lose four straight and the Series. Lemon survived just a few weeks into the 1982 season (the Yankees were 6–8) before Steinbrenner dismissed him one last time, despite a promise for Steinbrenner he would manage the season [...] "no matter what." [...] Of the agreement between Lemon and Steinbrenner, Steinbrenner said, [...] "Lem and I talked. He said it was O.K. He said he didn't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> promise anyway."

500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E

500|$|On 26 May 2012, it was {{reported}} that Cheryl would perform [...] "Call My Name" [...] with live vocals on The Voice UK, following allegedly pre-recorded performances that occurred the previous year on The X Factor UK. It was also reported that The Voice executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would [...] "provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast." [...] As the performance began, Cheryl swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly ellaborated routine. Following the broadcast, Cheryl received mixed comments from viewers, with a few who accused the singer of lip synching, while others, including pop singers Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, Cheryl addressed the negative comments, and said that [...] "if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compliment." [...] She performed the track again on The Graham Norton Show on 8 June 2012, and was also accused of lip synching. Cheryl also performed [...] "Call My Name" [...] at Capital FM Summertime Ball on 9 June 2012 in front of 80,000 fans at the Wembley Stadium, she was a surprise artist. During the energetic performance, the singer sported an outfit designed by Pam Hogg, and was accompanied by 12 backing dancers. Colette Fahy of the Daily Mail accused Cheryl of lip synching and stated that [...] "it was evident to the crowd that [...] was miming." [...] Cheryl performed [...] "Call My Name" [...] at Stand Up to Cancer. However, the performance was also subject of controversy after technical errors with her microphone occurred, meaning that viewers could only hear her voice faintly singing along to a musical backing track. Cheryl also performed the track on a T4 special, at The Voice Denmark, and at the 2012 Jingle Bell Ball. [...] "Call My Name" [...] was also performed on Cheryl's debut headlining solo concert tour, named A Million Lights Tour, in October 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Although in {{the first}} 30 years of the {{existence}} of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuits who were conversos (Catholic-convert Jews), an anti-converso faction led to the Decree de genere (1593) which proclaimed that either Jewish or Muslim ancestry, no matter how distant, was an insurmountable impediment for admission to the Society of Jesus. This new rule was contrary to the original wishes of Ignatius who [...] "said that he would <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage."
