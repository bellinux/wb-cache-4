40|$|Expectation {{gap between}} users of {{financial}} statements with auditor's failure {{to reveal the}} presence of auditors in performing their roles and responsibilities. The general public often assumes that the auditing and accounting are the same thing, although it is fundamentally different.

Samples obtained by convenience sampling. Data obtained by using questionnaires that were then analyzed with a different test t-test. The results of the study {{is that there is a}} significant expectation gap on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of auditors and the audit process, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of <b>the</b> role of auditors, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of competence and independence, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of auditor performance between users of governmental financial statements with government auditors. Government auditors have a more positive perception of the auditors and the audit process, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of <b>the</b> role of auditors, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of competence and independence, and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of auditor performance in comparison with users of government financial statements...|$|R
