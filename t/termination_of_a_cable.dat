50|$|Termination of modular {{connector}} cables is very similar, {{regardless of}} the number of positions and contacts in the plug. To prevent damage to the plug (and the expensive crimp die-set), the crimp tool must be carefully matched to the plug being attached. For example, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> with an 8P8C plug involves using a hand crimper or crimp machine containing an 8P8C die-set or an A67T standard die-set. An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug. As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching the plug to the cable.|$|E
40|$|In this work, <b>a</b> novel {{formulation}} <b>of</b> crosstalk (XT) is developed, {{in which}} the perturbation/loading effect that the generator circuit exerts on the passive part of the receptor circuit is elucidated. Practical conditions (i. e., weak coupling and matching/mismatching of the generator circuit) under which this effect can be neglected are then discussed and exploited to develop an alternative radiated susceptibility (RS) test procedure which resorts to crosstalk to induce at the <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cable</b> harness the same disturbance that would be induced by an external uniform plane-wave field. The proposed procedure, here developed with reference to typical RS setups foreseen by Standards of the aerospace sector, assures equivalence with field coupling without a priori knowledge and/or specific assumption on the units connected to the <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> the cable harness. Accuracy of the proposed scheme of equivalence is assessed by virtual experiment carried out in a full-wave simulation environment...|$|R

This thesis will examine the immediate <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{employment and}} the consequences that this form <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment brings for the company. The first part defines the term employment and immediate <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment and simultaneously describes the situations in which the employee or employer has the right for immediate <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment. Attention is also paid to the validity <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment and delivery method. The Thesis will also include analysis of specific situations in a particular company in which <b>an</b> immediate <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment had occurred. The analysis will examine several points of view which will include: the reasons and the process <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment, accordance with the law, assessment of the consequences and possible costs for the company...|$|R

40|$|As {{the title}} already suggests, this {{rigorous}} thesis {{is focused on}} the invalid <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment. The aim is to answer questions of legal defects of the juridical act leading to the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment relationship which are concerned with the recodification of the Czech private law made by the Act no. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code. The Civil Code as a lex generalis brought into the Czech legal order expressly provisions not only about invalid juridical acts, but also about putative juridical acts. These distinguishing consequences of defects of any juridical acts must be reflected in the matter <b>of</b> the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment relationship. The crucial part of this rigorous thesis is therefore a description and analysis of defects of juridical acts in general and their specifics when terminating an employment relationship. Another equally important part is the analysis of the procedural context associated with the claiming for invalid or putative juridical acts aimed at <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment relationship in the civil proceedings. This rigorous thesis provides <b>a</b> comprehensive view <b>of</b> the institutes of invalid and putative <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employment relationship in the context of applicable judicial decisions and even through <b>a</b> description <b>of</b> some practical situations [...] ...|$|R
