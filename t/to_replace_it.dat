5|$|Before his death, Henry {{instructed}} the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, {{place it in}} a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik’s remains were to be buried.|$|E
5|$|Following {{criticism}} of BMO Field's use of FieldTurf and its rapid deterioration, MLSE {{agreed to a}} deal with the city <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a natural grass surface in time for the 2010 MLS Season. Along with the grass, a heating and drainage system was also installed at a cost of $3.5million to MLSE.|$|E
50|$|Sales of the Mustang {{remained}} strong, {{although in}} the 1980s Ford gave serious consideration <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a front-drive model (which eventually appeared as the Ford Probe instead). Emissions and fuel economy concerns led many of the latter-day pony cars to offer four-cylinder engines (sometimes with turbocharging), although they were never as popular as six-cylinder and V8 models.|$|R
50|$|Only one half-block office {{building}} was constructed, the 15-story Gateway One. The building was criticized as demonstrating the very qualities <b>it</b> was created <b>to</b> <b>replace.</b> <b>Its</b> height obstructed {{the view of}} the Arch, which was supposed to be highlighted along the Mall. In addition, its mass made the section of the mall on its block seem private and inaccessible.|$|R

5|$|The World Meteorological Organization retired {{one name}} {{in the spring of}} 1998: Pauline. It was {{replaced}} in the 2003 season by Patricia. In 2006, a name from the Central Pacific list was retired due to its effects west of the International Dateline in this season: Paka. The name set <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> is Pama.|$|E
5|$|Amon's reign was in {{the midst}} of a {{transitional}} time for the Levant and the entire Mesopotamian region. To the east of Judah, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate while the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b> To the west, Egypt was still recovering under Psamtik I from its Assyrian occupation, transforming from a vassal state to an autonomous ally. In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} north, it crosses an isthmus between Hamilton Harbour and Cootes Paradise alongside several roads {{which it has}} served <b>to</b> <b>replace.</b> <b>It</b> circles around the northern shore of Hamilton Harbour and returns to an eastward orientation. The concurrency with Highway6 ends at an interchange where Highway403 continues east and Highway6 travels north towards Guelph. The freeway continues straight for several kilometres and meets the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway407 at the Freeman Interchange.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the ageing Model 1914 grenade {{and was used}} during World War II. The grenade was complicated to use and manufacture. After the German invasion of the USSR, the simple and crude RG-42 was developed <b>to</b> slowly <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because {{it was not}} {{possible}} to upgrade Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, was built <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b> Gardner became an assessment centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses both on and off campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students can choose to be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.|$|E
5|$|By 1953, the {{lighthouse}} was in poor {{condition and the}} U.S. Coast Guard opted <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a skeleton tower. The lighthouse was sold to the Fairfield Dock Company, which initially planned to move it ashore, but it was later decided to dismantle and scrap it. A plan existed to move {{the lighthouse}} ashore to a city park as a monument to Connecticut's maritime heritage, but the location could not be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Due to the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township {{was washed}} {{out and the}} New Jersey Department of Transportation had <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic {{traveling}} between Vineland and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. This bridge replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a wider and higher crossing of the river.|$|E

5|$|Hindley's {{first job}} {{was as a}} junior clerk at a local {{electrical}} engineering firm. She ran errands, made tea, and typed. She was well liked at the firm, enough so that when she lost her first week's wage packet, the other girls had a collection <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b> Beginning at Christmas 1958, Hindley began a short relationship with Ronnie Sinclair, and became engaged at 17. The engagement was called off several months later; Hindley apparently thought Sinclair immature, and unable to provide her with the life she envisaged for herself.|$|E
5|$|The Grey Cup {{has been}} stolen on two occasions: it {{disappeared}} {{for three days}} in 1967 when it {{was taken from the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a prank, and in December 1969 it was stolen from the offices of the Ottawa Rough Riders at Lansdowne Park. The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy's recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. The thieves were never found.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structure}} {{in what is}} now Sheerness was a fort built by order of Henry VIII to prevent enemy ships from entering the River Medway and attacking the naval dockyard at Chatham. In 1666 work began <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed during the 1667 Dutch raid on the Medway. The Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, subsequently ordered the construction of Sheerness Dockyard as an extension to that at Chatham.|$|E

5|$|When the Buffalo nickel {{had been}} struck for 25 years and could be {{replaced}} without an act of Congress, the Mint moved quickly <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b> Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, {{and there was no}} public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. Anticipating the 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson's birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E

5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid {{greater attention to}} the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a classical statue.|$|E
5|$|During {{its history}} {{spanning}} seven centuries, the castle {{was owned by}} a succession of seven families. One of the owners, the count Lafaurie of Monbadon, peer of France, was a catalyst {{to the construction of}} the Eiffel bridge. In March 1891, the Quancard brothers Jean and Eugène bought the property for 110 000 francs, and the Quancard family remains the last owners. The purchase came after a severe phylloxera outbreak, causing the death of over half of French vineyards, devalued the property. The land area was covered mostly with rock until the Quancard brothers used explosives to remove it, and large amounts of clay-limestone soil, known to be beneficial for the wine produce, was brought <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{armistice}} with Germany in November 1918, {{the majority of}} the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Bayern was listed as one of the ships to be handed over, though Baden initially was not. The battlecruiser , which the British believed to be completed, was requested instead. When it became apparent to the Allies that Mackensen was still under construction, Baden was ordered <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b> On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Baden arrived at Scapa Flow separately on 14 December 1918.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, President Manuel L. Quezon dreamt {{of a city}} that would become the future capital of the country <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> Manila. <b>It</b> is {{believed}} that his earlier trip to Mexico influenced his vision.|$|R
