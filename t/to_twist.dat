5|$|Tiger sharks {{have a large}} upper lobe, {{which allows}} for slow {{cruising}} and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark must be able <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.|$|E
5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders {{and consume}} {{a range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegree (Emex australis) <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> out and remove the underground parts.|$|E

5|$|The pivot catapult, {{known as}} the {{traction}} trebuchet, had existed in China since the Warring States period (as evidenced by the Mozi). It was regularly used in sieges during the Han dynasty, by both besiegers and the besieged. The most common projectile weapon used during the Han dynasty was the small handheld, trigger-activated crossbow (and to a lesser extent, the repeating crossbow), first invented in China during the 6th or 5th century BCE. Although the nomadic Xiongnu were able <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> their waists slightly while horse-riding and shoot arrows at targets behind them, the official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) deemed the Chinese crossbow superior to the Xiongnu bow.|$|E
5|$|After the war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved, and Phleps {{returned}} to his homeland, which had become part of Romania under the Treaty of Trianon. He joined the Romanian Army and was appointed as commander of the Saxon National Guard, a militia formed from the German-speaking people of Siebenbürgen. In this role he opposed the Hungarian communist revolutionary government of Béla Kun, which fought Romania in 1919. During a battle at the Tisza river against Kun's forces he disobeyed direct orders and was subsequently court-martialled. The trial concluded that Phleps had saved the Romanian forces through his actions, and {{he was promoted to}} Oberst (colonel). He commanded the 84th Infantry Regiment, then joined the general staff and taught logistics at the War Academy in Bucharest. He attended the V Army Corps staff college in Brașov, and published a book, Logistics: Basics of Organisation and Execution, in 1926 which became the standard work on logistics for the Romanian Army. Ironically, after the book was published, Phleps failed his first general's examination on the topic of logistics. He commanded various Romanian units, including the 1st Brigade of the vânători de munte (mountain troops) and also acted as a military advisor to King Carol II in the 1930s. Phleps reached the rank of General-locotenent (major general) despite his reported disdain for the corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy of the royal court. After criticising government policy and publicly calling King Carol a liar when another general tried <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> his words, he was transferred to the reserves in 1940 and dismissed from the service at his own request in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

25|$|The {{twist drill}} bit {{was invented by}} Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1861. The {{original}} method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the drill bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a grinding wheel to cut the flutes {{in the same manner}} as cutting helical gears.|$|E
25|$|As {{the piston}} moves in and out, the seal drags and {{stretches}} on the piston, causing the seal <b>to</b> <b>twist.</b> The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. The piston {{is allowed to}} move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops the piston from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes up the slack caused by the wear of the brake pads, {{eliminating the need for}} return springs.|$|E

25|$|After {{hearing all}} the evidence, {{it was decided}} that the weather had caused a freeze–thaw action which had led to {{settlement}} in the ground. Another contributory factor was the construction work being carried out during poor weather, and then not being checked for settlement when the weather had improved. The settlement was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> the tracks and reduce the contact between the rack (on the track) and the pinion (on the locomotive). The weight and speed of the train did the rest. The damage caused by the first derailment made the second almost inevitable.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} above common forms, body casts could come in nearly any size and configuration. For example, from the 1910s to the 1970s, use of a {{turnbuckle}} cast, which used metal turnbuckles <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> two halves of the cast so as to forcibly straighten the spine before surgery, was common. The turnbuckle cast had no single configuration, and could be {{as small as a}} body jacket split in half, or could include the head, one or both legs to the knees or feet, and/or one arm to the elbow or wrist depending on the choice of the doctor.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{diseases}} {{can affect}} the Leonberger—certain types of cancers are very common in the breed. Gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly called bloat, is another serious condition that affects many of the large and giant breed dogs, particularly those with deep chests. It causes the stomach <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> and can be fatal quite quickly. Adult Leonbergers should always be fed twice a day rather than one large meal {{in order to reduce}} the likelihood of bloat. Leonbergers are not alone in inheriting serious diseases and according to the University of Sydney's LIDA taskforce, Leonbergers have relatively few health issues compared to other dog breeds.|$|E

You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw.

25|$|In {{materials}} science, {{and especially}} elasticity theory, ideas of torsion also {{play an important}} role. One problem models the growth of vines, focusing {{on the question of}} how vines manage <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> around objects. The vine itself is modeled as a pair of elastic filaments twisted around one another. In its energy-minimizing state, the vine naturally grows {{in the shape of a}} helix. But the vine may also be stretched out to maximize its extent (or length). In this case, the torsion of the vine is related to the torsion of the pair of filaments (or equivalently the surface torsion of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (geodesic) configuration of the vine and its energy-minimizing configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{torsion balance}} {{consists}} of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak torsion spring. In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an insulating rod with a metal-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a silk thread. The ball was charged with a known charge of static electricity, and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the instrument. By knowing how much force it took <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his inverse-square proportionality law.|$|E

25|$|In early November 1993, Reveille V {{underwent}} {{emergency surgery}} for gastric volvulus, which causes an animal's stomach <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> out of place. The surgery was successful, {{and she made}} a full recovery. Later that month she relinquished her spot as mascot to Reveille VI. For {{the next six years}} she lived with a local veterinarian and graduate of Texas A, Dr. Joe West. Reveille V was euthanized in June 1999 because she suffered from arthritis and a neurological disorder. Her funeral was delayed until September to enable students to attend. Over 3,000 students and alumni attended the funeral, which included Taps, a prayer from a campus chaplain, and eulogies from her former handlers. Reveille V was initially buried at Cain Park on the Texas A campus, but her grave was relocated to the north end of Kyle Field once stadium renovations were finished.|$|E
25|$|Further explosions by {{two more}} torpedoes that hit under the second stack, port side (near frame 82 and about frame 85) {{less than two}} minutes later at about 0205 caused catastrophic and {{terminal}} damage. Men were thrown about twice with each following explosion and the force was greater the higher up in the ship's structure. This is the time that Carpenter was injured. The forward movement of the ship along with the massive structural frame damage caused the ship <b>to</b> <b>twist</b> and jackknife around the damaged area. The ship's momentum quickly fell off and began to flood. The center part twisted to 45 degrees port sinking first. It dragged the rear of the ship down until the stern was vertical. Men quickly realized that the damage was fatal and began to abandon ship. About 22 minutes after the ship was first hit the ship sunk, at about 0225. In the meantime, Carpenter - who had been wounded in the legs - and others of the crew abandoned ship by going over the side after cutting free all the surviving lift rafts into the ocean. Even though the forward momentum of the ship dropped off rapidly the survivors were scattered over several hundred yards, at night, amidst a raging naval battle. Later currents would separate them even more.|$|E
