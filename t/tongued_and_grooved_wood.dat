50|$|Ideally shearers {{should not}} have to cross the {{shearing}} board with their sheep or move them excessive lengths. Earlier shed plans often had the catching pen {{on the opposite side of}} the release chutes which necessitated shearers crossing the board and paths with the roustabout.

Sheep may be released through the wall or through a chute in the floor, depending on the plan used. A <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> wooden floor is best for the shearing board and wool processing area (wool room) as it is easier to keep clean, especially with scrapers and to slide butts of wool along.|$|R

50|$|Aboriginals {{had long}} known the Maleny district, on the Blackall Range behind Nambour, {{as an area}} where the {{important}} Bunya Pine (Araucaria bidwilli) grew. The first Europeans to live in the district were transient timber getters who heard from local Aborigines of the huge red cedar (Toona australis) trees on the Blackall Range. While timber was cut, it was not always shifted {{due to the lack of}} roads and steepness of the terrain. The first non-indigenous person to settle in the area was Isaac Burgess, who took up residence on his selection on 1 January 1872; others followed in the late 1870s. They built their homes using pit-sawn timber from their own land. Pits were dug near where the trees stood and there they were sawn down to scantlings and boardings, <b>and</b> afterwards planed, <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> by hand as required. As the red cedar was cut out attention turned to the beech trees and Maleny pioneers of the timber industry include Isaac Burgess, Francis and William Dunlop, Joseph McCarthy, and JD Campbell.|$|R

The river bed is protected against erosion for a width of 67 ft upstream by a stone paving laid on a puddle clay blanket to check infiltration, and on the downstream side for the same width by a stone paving having an inverted filter bed underneath, so that any springs that may be caused by the water above the sluices shall not carry sand with them from beneath the paving.|$|R
40|$|Stricter Swedish {{building}} regulations {{require a}} moisture safety design process {{to be carried}} out before houses are built. In order to predict moisture-critical conditions, a properly verified, user-friendly and reliable calculation tool {{that could be used in}} this design phase, is required. This paper initially presents a blind method that could be used in order to verify hyg-rothermal calculation tools in a reliable manner. Furthermore, general results and findings from blind validations of a transient heat and moisture calculation tool carried out in cold roofs are summarized and presented. The comparisons include measurements and calculations of temperature and relative humidity and were carried out in Northern European climates. In general, the results show a good correlation between measured and calculated values. Comparisons show that the studied tool can be used during the design phase to predict moisture risks. However, factors such as the influence of impaired temperature measurements on relative humidity have to be taken into account. There is also a need for outdoor climate boundary conditions that take into account critical periods. Measurements and calculations also established that the most moisture-critical conditions in general occurred in the <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> wooden roof boarding located under the roof membrane.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} novel electrotactile display {{that can be}} {{integrated}} into current handheld devices with touch screens. In this display, tactile information is presented to the fingertip of the user by transmitting small currents through electrodes. Experiments were conducted to investigate the perception of simulated textures using this electrotactile display technique. One fundamental feature of texture, which {{is the focus of}} this study, is roughness. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the relationship between electrotactile stimulation parameters such as current and pulse frequency and the perception of roughness. An increase in the current magnitude resulted in an increase in perceived roughness. The aim of the second experiment was to investigate parameter combinations of electrotactile stimuli can be used to simulate textures. Subjects adjusted the intensity and frequency of the current stimuli until the simulated textures were perceived as being equal to reference textures such as sandpapers of varying grit numbers <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> <b>woods</b> with varying <b>groove</b> widths. Subjects tended to find an electrotactile stimulus with a high current magnitude and a low pulse frequency more suitable to represent rough surfaces. They tended to find just-perceptible current magnitudes suitable for very smooth surfaces and did not show a preference for any frequency.

40|$|Mould {{and blue}} stain attacks {{has become a}} growing problem in the {{construction}} industry. These attacks cause problems of various kinds. If it occurs indoors, it may cause health problems and in cases where mould is outside and fully visible problems become mainly of aesthetic nature. This thesis {{is a part of}} a TCN-project (Mould growth on sapwood boards exposed outdoors: Impact of drying process) which was conducted in 2009 at LTU Skellefteå and SP Trätek. One of the goals of the TCN-project was to reduce mould risk of <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boards by temperature treatment. This thesis is a part of that work. The thesis consists of two parts: A. Determine whether heat pressing on the flat sides of unplaned lateral exchange of spruce has any effect on mould susceptibility. Is it possible to make the sugars at the surface and the surface itself less attractive to fungi by contact heating? The work contains the following main elements: § Scanning of wood surfaces with line camera before and after mould test § Heating experiments in veneer press § Mould test in climate chamber § Visual assessment of mould growth with self-made grading system B. Evaluation of the software MouldAnalyser 1. 0. The purpose of the program is to determine percentage of mould growth in scanned RGB images of infested wood surfaces. The wood used in conducted experiments was 22 x 100 mm boards of spruce. The test material consisted of five 30 cm long specimens per group (= 10 surfaces) and nine references (untreated). Three temperatures and three treatment times were selected for the heat pressing. Temperatures: 140 °C, 170 °C and 200 °C Times: 1 min, 3 min and 10 min A total of 9 groups (3 times x 3 temperatures) The mould test lasted for eight weeks in a climate chamber with a relative humidity of 95 % and a temperature of 22 °C. The evaluation of the mould growth was made with a four-point mould scale. Conclusions A. It is possible to make wood surfaces less attractive to mould by contact heating. All three press temperatures and two out of three (3 min and 10 min) press times resulted in significantly lower mean mould growth than the reference group. (All significant differences are at significance level 0, 05). B. MouldAnalyser 1. 0. + Works well when mould growth is heavy Works well with contrasty fouling Works well with homogeneous material - When mould growth is moderate, a unreasonable amount of noise occurs Wane and knots are classified as mould Sometimes veining and other surface roughnesses are classified as mould Recommended for analysis of microscopy images or other selected (homogeneous) surfaces.

40|$|Plank (tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove)</b> <b>wood</b> decking is {{a product}} that is {{commonly}} used in post and beam timber construction to transfer gravity loads on roofs and floors. In 2010, The National Building Code of Canada changed the application area of the specified concentrated roof live loads from 750 mm x 750 mm to 200 mm x 200 mm. The change was made to better reflect the area which a construction worker with equipment occupies. Preliminary analysis showed that {{the change in the}} application area of concentrated loads may {{have a significant impact on}} the design of decking systems. Little research or development has been done on plank decking since the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s. An experimental program was undertaken at the University of Ottawa’s structural laboratory to better understand the behaviour of plank decking under uniformly distributed and concentrated loads. Non-destructive and destructive tests were conducted on plank decking systems to investigate their stiffness and failure mode characteristics under uniformly distributed as well as concentrated loads. The experimental test program was complimented with a detailed finite element model in order to predict the behaviour of a plank decking system, especially the force transfer between decks through the tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> joint. The study showed that the published deflection coefficients for uniformly distributed loads can accurately predict the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009). For unbalanced uniformly distributed loads on two-span continuous layup, it was found that the deflection coefficient of 0. 42 was non-conservative. It was also found that under concentrated loads, the stiffness of the decking system increased significantly as more boards were added. A deflection coefficient of 0. 40 is appropriate to calculate the deflection for the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009) under concentrated load on an area of 200 mm by 200 mm. Significant load sharing was observed for plank decking under concentrated loads. An increase in capacity of about 1. 5 to 2. 5 times the capacity of the loaded boards was found. Furthermore, it was found that placing sheathing on top of a decking system had a significant effect in the case of concentrated load with an increase of over 50 % in stiffness and over 100 % in ultimate capacity...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increased}} awareness of climate change and higher energy costs, well-insulated buildings have become more common. Furthermore, interest {{in the use of}} wood in building to produce more carbon dioxide-efficient buildings has increased. However, thicker thermal insulation in building envelopes increases the risk of high relative humidity levels and the risk of mold-related damage in wood frame buildings. In order to predict the risk of moisture damage {{it is important to have}} a properly verified, user-friendly and reliable calculation tool that can be used in the design phase. The first part of the thesis presents a blind validation method that can be used in order to verify heat and moisture calculation tools in a reliable manner. General results and findings from blind validations using a one-dimensional transient heat and moisture calculation tool are summarized and presented. The comparisons include measurements and calculations of temperature and relative humidity in wood frame walls and ventilated roofs carried out in Northern European climates. The thesis shows and discusses examples of how the validated tool can be applied as a tool in the moisture safety design process in practice. Furthermore, a parametric study is presented in which moisture-critical positions in traditional Swedish wood frame designs in Northern European climates are investigated by using hygrothermal modeling. Traditional Swedish designs are compared to more energy-efficient designs with thicker thermal insulation, and alternative designs and important factors affecting the risk of mold growth in well-insulated wood frame constructions are presented. In general, the comparisons of measured and blindly calculated values show a good correlation. The results indicate that the validated tool can be used during the moisture design process in a reliable manner. However, factors such as the influence of impaired temperature readings on relative humidity have to be taken into account. There is also a need for developing outdoor climate boundary conditions that include critical periods and variations between different years. Unexpected human behavior, poor workmanship and poor design may have major influences on the hygrothermal conditions in the wood frame construction. Several unexpected leakages caused by driving rain penetrating deep into different wooden frame walls, on the inside of the air gap, were noticed. It has to be discussed and further investigated what appropriate safety margins should be used in future hygrothermal calculations. It has been found that there is a higher risk of moisture-related damage in thicker insulated walls and roofs. However, this risk can be reduced by choosing more suitable designs in which well-ventilated air gaps behind the cladding and exterior vapor-permeable moisture-proof thermal insulation boards are of great importance in walls. Wooden roof constructions were found to be very sensitive to all kind of leakages, both from exterior precipitation penetrating the roofing felt and interior humid air penetrating cracks or poorly executed joints in the interior vapor membrane. The ventilation rate in a cold roof air gap or cold attic must, primarily, be sufficiently high to remove all moisture. However, high ventilation rates decrease the temperature which, in turn, increases the relative humidity and this may cause damage. An unnecessarily high ventilation rate in the cold attic or air gap in roofs should therefore be avoided. This is possible to achieve if the exterior and interior membranes are water- and vapor-tight. The results also show that exterior insulation, on the outside of <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> wooden roof boarding limits the risk of damage...|$|R
