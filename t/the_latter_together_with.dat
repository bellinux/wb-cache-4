Among the more famous works {{dedicated to the}} uprising are the poem Septemvri by Geo Milev, the novel Horo by Anton Strashimirov and the painting Septemvri 1923 by Ivan Milev. Others include the books of poetry Proleten vyatar (Spring Wind) by Nikola Furnadzhiev and Zhertveni kladi (Sacrificial Stakes) by Asen Raztsvetnikov. <b>The</b> <b>latter,</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> Angel Karaliychev, {{author of the book}} Razh (Rye), were later classed as the [...] "September generation of writers".|$|E

2500|$|In {{classical}} music, Jan Sweelinck {{ranks as}} the Dutch most famous composer, with Louis Andriessen amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers. Ton Koopman is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Notable violinists are Janine Jansen and André Rieu. <b>The</b> <b>latter,</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> his Johann Strauss Orchestra, has taken classical and waltz music on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts. The most famous Dutch classical composition is [...] "Canto Ostinato" [...] by Simeon ten Holt, a minimalistic composition for multiple instruments. Acclaimed harpist Lavinia Meijer in 2012 released an album with works from Philip Glass that she transcribed for harp, with approval of Glass himself.

2500|$|When {{one goes}} from {{geometric}} dimension one, e.g. an algebraic number field, to geometric dimension two, e.g. a regular model of an elliptic curve {{over a number}} field, the two-dimensional part of the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the arithmetic zeta function of the model deals with the poles of the zeta function. In dimension one {{the study of the}} zeta integral in Tate's thesis does not lead to new important information on the Riemann hypothesis. Contrary to this, in dimension two work of Ivan Fesenko on two-dimensional generalisation of Tate's thesis includes an integral representation of a zeta integral closely related to the zeta function. In this new situation, not possible in dimension one, the poles of the zeta function can be studied via the zeta integral and associated adele groups. [...] Related conjecture of [...] on the positivity of the fourth derivative of a boundary function associated to the zeta integral essentially implies the pole part of the generalized Riemann hypothesis. [...] proved that <b>the</b> <b>latter,</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> some technical assumptions, implies Fesenko's conjecture.|$|E
2500|$|The early {{occupation}} of the Euphrates basin was limited to its upper reaches; that is, the area that is popularly known as the Fertile Crescent. Acheulean stone artifacts {{have been found in}} the Sajur basin and in the El Kowm oasis in the central Syrian steppe; <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> remains of Homo erectus that were dated to 450,000 years old. In the Taurus Mountains and {{the upper part of the}} Syrian Euphrates valley, early permanent villages such as Abu Hureyra – at first occupied by hunter-gatherers but later by some of the earliest farmers, Jerf el-Ahmar, Mureybet and Nevalı Çori became established from the eleventh millennium BCE onward. In the absence of irrigation, these early farming communities were limited to areas where rainfed agriculture was possible, that is, the upper parts of the Syrian Euphrates as well as Turkey. Late Neolithic villages, characterized by the introduction of pottery in the early 7th millennium BCE, are known throughout this area. Occupation of lower Mesopotamia started in the 6th millennium and is generally associated with the introduction of irrigation, as rainfall in this area is insufficient for dry agriculture. Evidence for irrigation has been found at several sites dating to this period, including Tell es-Sawwan. During the 5th millennium BCE, or late Ubaid period, northeastern Syria was dotted by small villages, although some of them grew to a size of over [...] In Iraq, sites like Eridu and Ur were already occupied during the Ubaid period. Clay boat models found at Tell Mashnaqa along the Khabur indicate that riverine transport was already practiced during this period. The Uruk period, roughly coinciding with the 4th millennium BCE, saw the emergence of truly urban settlements across Mesopotamia. Cities like Tell Brak and Uruk grew to over [...] in size and displayed monumental architecture. The spread of southern Mesopotamian pottery, architecture and sealings far into Turkey and Iran has generally been interpreted as the material reflection of a widespread trade system aimed at providing the Mesopotamian cities with raw materials. Habuba Kabira on the Syrian Euphrates is a prominent example of a settlement that is interpreted as an Uruk colony.|$|E
