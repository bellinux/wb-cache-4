Some people were leaving at that time but, really, it was after Milliken <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> mass flight to the suburbs. If the case had gone the other way, it is likely that Detroit would not have experienced the steep decline in its tax base that has occurred since then." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evel Knievel {{took great}} pride in his core values. Throughout his career and later life he would {{repeatedly}} talk {{about the importance of}} [...] "keeping his word". He stated that although he knew he may not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the canyon jump, Knievel stated, [...] "If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor. Tell him <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Milliken {{was perhaps}} the {{greatest}} missed opportunity of that period," [...] said Myron Orfield, {{professor of law at}} the University of Minnesota. [...] "Had that gone the other way, it would have opened the door to fixing nearly all of Detroit's current problems." [...] John Mogk, a professor of law and an expert in urban planning at Wayne State University in Detroit, says, [...] "Everybody thinks that it was the riots [...] that caused the white families to leave.

2500|$|Experimenting {{with the}} use of {{negative}} space and organic forms in the late 1940s, by the mid-1950s Alston began creating notably modernist style paintings. Woman with Flowers (1949) {{has been described as a}} tribute to Modigliani and African art makes another strong appearance in Ceremonial (1950). Untitled works during the era show his use of color overlay using muted colors to create simple layered abstracts of still live. Symbol (1953) relates to Picasso's Guernica, which was a favorite work of Alston's. His final work of the 1950s, Walking, was inspired by the Montgomery Bus Boycott and has come to represent [...] "the surge of energy among African Americans to organize in their struggle for full equality." [...] About the artwork, Alston is quoted [...] "The idea of a march was growing....It was in the air...and this painting just came. I called it Walking on purpose. It wasn't the militancy <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> later. It was a very definite walk-not going back, no hesitation." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.2 out of 10. He was {{critical}} of the general gameplay, which he argued [...] "quickly boils down to you running from room to room, killing anything that pops up along the way." [...] He was also critical of the creature design, which he felt was [...] "largely recycled from last year's game, which is disappointing. The way the monsters in the last game were based on various methods of execution was interesting, but retrofitting them to fit Baltimore street crime seems cheap." [...] He concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind has its moments, {{but most of these}} moments are the same sorts of moments <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> in last year's game. If you're a fan of the previous game and you're looking for more of the same, Ties That Bind fits the bill, but more expansion on the themes of the first game would have made for a much more interesting final product." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{years after}} Bodhidharma's death, Ambassador Sòngyún of {{northern}} Wei {{is said to}} have seen him walking while holding a shoe at the Pamir Heights. Sòngyún asked Bodhidharma where he was going, to which Bodhidharma replied [...] "I am going home". When asked why he was holding his shoe, Bodhidharma answered [...] "You will know when you reach Shaolin monastery. Don't mention <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me or you will meet with disaster". After arriving at the palace, Sòngyún told the emperor that he met Bodhidharma on the way. The emperor said Bodhidharma was already dead and buried and had Sòngyún arrested for lying. At Shaolin Monastery, the monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead and had been buried in a hill behind the temple. The grave was exhumed and was found to contain a single shoe. The monks then said [...] "Master has gone back home" [...] and prostrated three times: [...] "For nine years he had remained and nobody knew him; Carrying a shoe in hand he went home quietly, without ceremony." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1890s Dresser began {{composing}} {{his most}} famous songs, including [...] "Just Tell Them <b>That</b> <b>You</b> <b>Saw</b> Me" [...] (1895). Dresser's songs, along with others published by Howley, Haviland and Company, {{were included in the}} top minstrel acts and shows around the country.

In [...] "Wabash" [...] Dresser reminisced about his childhood home in Indiana, which was near the Wabash River. With the success of [...] "Wabash", many newspapers compared Dresser to popular music composer Stephen Foster. When asked what inspired him to compose the song, Dresser replied, [...] "The same sweet memory that inspired that other Hoosier, James Whitcomb Riley, to sing the 'Old Swimmin' Hole." [...] The location of where the song was written is referenced in a short story in The Atlantic by Elizabeth Stuckey-French. She wrote, [...] "Paul Dresser wrote 'On the Banks of the Wabash' at Mudlavia." ...|$|E
