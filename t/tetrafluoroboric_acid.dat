The reason that these complexes are so remarkably stable is due to significant delocalization of the cationic charge onto the Co2(CO)6 moiety. Experimental evidence for the charge delocalization shows {{an increase in the}} IR absorption frequencies of the C-O ligands present in the cations compared to those in the parent alcohols. Also, when the cation is formed the central carbon is rehybridised from sp3 to sp2 Orbital hybridisation. This causes the atoms to exhibit a trigonal planar arrangement and shortens the covalent bonds around the central carbon in the cation due to the increase in S character.|$|E

The cleanest {{synthetic}} {{strategy for}} the preparation of M–NHC complexes (M = transition metal) is the direct metalation. This method requires the presence at the starting complex of a strong Brønsted base as ligand, which becomes labile by deprotonating the imidazolium salt. Neutral transition-metal polyhydride complexes are basic enough to produce this deprotonation. In addition, the complex OsH 6 (PiPr 3) 2 has demonstrated to activate σ bonds {{of a wide range}} of organic molecules. 1 In the light of these precedents, we reacted this hexahydride with N-heterocyclic carbenes in order to obtain the corresponding neutral trihydride derivatives OsH 3 (C,C'–L) (PiPr 3) 2 (C is referred to ortho-metalated phenyl carbon atom; C' to N-heterocyclic carbene carbon atom; L to chelate NHC ligand).

The major findings from the performed viscosity measurements and single coreflood experiments can be summarized as follows: the crosslinking of the polymer occurred at a pH value of 1. 8. At a pH of less than 2, doubling the breaker concentration did not affect the viscosity of the acid. However, at a pH of greater than 2, the viscosity of acid was reduced by 30 percent. At a breaker concentration of 0 ppm, the appearance of Zr in the core effluent sample was delayed by 0. 25 PV compared to the reaction product, while at 100 ppm, Zr was delayed by 0. 75 PV. At 200 ppm breaker, no Zr ions were detected in the effluent samples. Additionally, it was observed that as the breaker concentration increased, more Zr remained inside the core, as ZrF 4, which is water-insoluble. Increasing the breaker concentration from 100 to 200 ppm reduced the final normalized pressure drop by 50 percent at injection rate of 2. 5 cm 3 /min.

40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Susan Lever, ChemistryThe di-iodinated peptide DMT-D-Ala-Phe-Phe (DAPP) {{was found}} to have high {{affinity}} and selectivity for µ-opioid receptors of cancer cells. Radioiodination of this peptide could aid in imaging of tumors; however, the molecule's high lipophilicity would not allow easy travel in vivo. In order to reduce lipophilicity but keep the µ-receptor affinity, two alternative peptides were produced using solid phase synthesis: DMT-D-Ala-Phe-Orn and DMT-Nva-Phe-Orn. Their structure and purity were evaluated using LCMS and amino acid analysis. To further reduce the lipophilicity, two methods for mono-iodination were investigated on Boc protected dimethyltyrosine (Boc-DMT). In the first, commonly accepted iodination method, N-iodosuccinamide (NIS) was used as the iodinating reagent. Two equivalents of NIS were reacted with Boc-DMT in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7. 4). A mixture of mono- and di-iodinated products was produced, and the percent di-iodinated product increased with reaction time. The second iodination method used bis(pyridine) iodonium tetrafluoroborate (IPy 2 BF 4) as the iodinating agent with <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4) catalyst. Optimization of this method was done by varying the reaction time, solvent, and equivalents of IPy 2 BF 4.

The scale of the reaction did not affect the reaction speed or product distribution. After work up with water and ethyl acetate, the mono-iodinated Boc-DMT will be purified through column chromatography. The 2 new peptides should be synthesized again with the iodinated Boc-DMT. Lipophilicity of these new molecules should be tested. Mono-radio-iodination can be done using the same method, and biological evaluations of the molecules will be conducted...|$|E

Many of those scaffolds {{can be achieved}} by difunctionalizations of tethered aminoalkenes. The main focus of this dissertation is the development of more efficient methods of alkene difunctionalizations that lead to substituted piperidines and pyrrolidines. Palladium-catalyzed method featured incorporation of alcohols to yield exo-cyclized products. Diamination and aminofluorination methods were developed under metal-free conditions with hypervalent iodine as oxidant and showed high preference for endo cyclization. A scope of carbamate-protected aminoalkenes were cyclized in presence of palladium catalyst and alcohol solvents acted as external nucleophiles. Primary and secondary alcohols and acetic acid were suitable nucleophiles and afforded cyclic aminoethers and aminoesters in good yields. This method was highly regioselective for formation of 5 -exo products. Interestingly, use of a palladium catalyst with halide ligands in polar solvents favored endo cyclization. Oxidative difunctionalizations under metal-free conditions were also developed. Hypervalent iodine reagents served as oxidants and were activated by strong Bronsted acids. Diamination products were achieved by employing various sulfonimides as external sources of nitrogen while <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> effectively gave aminofluorination products. The counterions of these Bronsted acids were incorporated into the product to yield substituted amino- and fluoropiperidines with high preference for endo cyclization. We sought to develop an enantioselective version of aminofluorination method by employing chiral iodine reagents. In order to make the use of chiral reagents practical conditions with catalytic amount of iodine were developed. Alternative oxidants such as xenon difluoride and meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid were used to reoxidize the aryl iodide and products were afforded in yields comparable with conditions employing stoichiometric amounts of hypervalent iodine. Chiral iodine reagents were also tested in catalytic amounts and afforded products in very good yields but did not induce enantioselectivity...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{economical}} and environ-mental driving force to develop a direct pro-cess for the conversion of hydrocarbons to fluorocarbons, selectively, without generat-ing large quantities of waste. The direct syn-thesis of CF bonds from CH bonds with HF is thermodynamically unfavorable. How-ever, the presence of oxygen and subsequent formation of water provide the thermody-namic driving force for the reaction to pro-ceed via an intermediate metal fluoride. This concept provides the basis for an alternate synthesis route. A previous attempt at oxy-fluorination of alkanes with CuF 2 was rela-tively unsuccessful {{because of the high}} CH bond strength (1). Fluorinated aromatics are widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals (2), with a volume exceeding 4000 metric tons per year (3). In particular, fluorobenzene is extensively used as a starting material for the industrial-scale manufacture of many fungicides and drugs (3). The classical synthetic route for fluoro-benzene is the Balz-Schiemann reaction (4) involving diazotization of an aromatic amine in the presence of <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (Scheme 1). The reaction in Scheme 1 produces large quantities of waste (such as NaBF 4 and NaCl) and is typical of the poor atom economy associated with fine chemi-cal manufacturing. Recent industrial advances (5) use HF in place of the fluoroboric acid; however, stoi-chiometric amounts of NaF and NH 4 F salts are produced as waste with the fluoroben-zene. Other approaches using HF exchange of chlorobenzene also generate HCl as waste (6). Aliphatic fluorocarbons are also pro-duced by initial chlorination of a hydrocarbon followed by catalytic exchange with HF, yielding 2 mol of HCl waste for every car-bon-fluorine bond produced (7). We now report an environmentally ac-ceptable process for the preparation of flu-orobenzene from benzene, HF, and oxygen. This process produces H 2 O as the only by-product.

The quantitation of Al, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Si and Mn in biofuels was carried out according to EN 15290 using acid decomposition of solid samples followed by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). A microwave-assisted acid digestion with a HNO 3 /H 2 O 2 /HF mixture was used, followed by HF complexation using H 3 BO 3. Due {{to the presence of}} <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> complex in the digestion solution, matrix effects were noticed during elemental quantification by AAS. Standard addition calibration methods did not compensate for this matrix effect. Matrix effects that constrain an analytical response may be overcome by applying the procedure used for samples to the calibration standards using the same reagents. However, this entails using large amounts of toxic reagents. In this work, the fluoric–boric acid matrix matching was assessed statistically using one-way ANOVA tests.

40|$|We {{report the}} effects of {{protonation}} on the structural and spectroscopic properties of 1, 4 -dimethoxy- 2, 5 -bis(2 -pyridyl) benzene (9) and the related AB coploymer poly 2, 5 -pyridylene-co- 1, 4 -[2, 5 - bis(2 -ethylhexyloxy) ]phenylene (7). X-ray crystallographic analysis of 9, 1, 4 -dimethoxy- 2, 5 -bis(2 -pyridyl) - benzene bis(formic acid) complex 10, and 1, 4 -dimethoxy- 2, 5 -bis(2 -pyridinium) benzene bis(tetrafluoroborate salt) (11) establishes that reaction of formic acid with 9 does not form an ionic pyridinium salt in the solid state, rather, the product 10 is a molecular complex with strong hydrogen bonds between each nitrogen atom and the hydroxyl hydrogen in formic acid. In contrast, reaction of 9 with <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> leads to the dication salt 11 with significant intramolecular hydrogen bonding (N-HâââO-Me) causing planarization of the molecule. The pyridinium and benzene rings in 11 form a dihedral angle of only 3. 9 ° (cf. pyridinebenzene dihedral angles of 35. 4 ° and 31. 4 ° in 9, and 43. 8 ° in 10). Accordingly, there are large red shifts in the optical absorption and emission spectra of 11, compared to 9 and 10. Polymer 7 displays a similar red shift in its absorption and photoluminescence spectra upon treatment with strong acids in neutral solution (e. g. methanesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, and hydrochloric acid). This is also observed in films of polymer 7 doped with strong acids. Excitation profiles show that emission arises from both protonated and nonprotonated sites in the polymer backbone. The protonation of the pyridine rings in polymer 7, accompanied by intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the oxygen of the adjacent solubilizing alkoxy substituent, provides a novel mechanism for driving the polymer into a near-planar conformation, thereby extending the ð-conjugation, and tuning the absorption and emission profiles. The electroluminescence of a device of configuration ITO/PEDOT/polymer 7 /Ca/Al is similarly red-shifted by protonation of the polymer...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{cyclopentadienyl}} and olefin substitution on preferred stereochemistry, the preparation of a series of singly bridged ansa-niobocene olefin hydride complexes is described. These complexes serve as stable transition state analogues for the much more kinetically labile group 4 metallocenium cationic intermediates in metallocene-catalyzed olefin polymerization. Characterization of the thermodynamically preferred isomers of niobocene olefin hydride complexes reveals that placement of a single alkyl substituent on the cyclopentadienyl ligand array may have a moderate effect on the stereochemistry of olefin coordination. Using dynamic NMR methods the rates of hydrogen exchange following intramolecular ethylene insertion into the metal-hydride bond have been measured for singly and doubly bridged group 5 ansa-metallocene complexes. The singly bridged ansa-niobocenes exchange up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than unbridged complexes. However, the doubly bridged ansa-tantalocene complex exchanges at a rate comparable to that previously reported for the unlinked and much slower than a singly bridged complex. These "ansa-effects" were investigated by DFT calculations on model complexes. The computed exchange pathway showed the presence of an agostic ethyl intermediate. The calculated barriers for hydrogen exchange of model unbridged, singly bridged, and doubly bridged niobocenes correlate with the experimental results. N,N'-Diaryl-diimine-ligated Pd(II) dimethyl complexes undergo protonolysis with <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (aq) in trifluoroethanol (TFE) to form cationic monomethyl complexes and methane. The cations activate benzene C-H bonds at room temperature. Kinetic analyses reveal trends similar to those observed for the analogous Pt complexes: the C-H activation step is rate determining and is inhibited by water, which is consistent with a mechanism in which benzene substitution proceeds by a solvent- (TFE-) assisted associative pathway. After benzene C-H activation under 1 atm dioxygen, the products of the reaction are biphenyl and a dimeric hydroxide complex. The Pd(0) formed in the reaction is reoxidized by dioxygen after the oxidative C-C bond formation. Toluene and trifluorotoluene were investigated as substrates to examine the regioselectivity of arene coupling. ...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{robust and}} {{reliable}} analytical procedure for {{the determination of}} 15 elements, namely Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Ag, Cd, Ba, Tl, Th and U in peat and plant materials by inductively coupled plasma-quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS) was developed. Powdered sample aliquots of approximately 220 mg were dissolved with various acid mixtures in a microwave heated high-pressure autoclave capable to digest 40 samples simultaneously. The selection of appropriate amounts of digestion acids (nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid or <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid)</b> was crucial to obtain accurate results. The optimized acid mixture for digestion of plant and peat samples consisted of 3 ml HNO 3 and 0. 1 ml HBF 4. An ultrasonic nebulizer with an additional membrane desolvation unit was found beneficial for the determination of Co, Ni, Ag, Tl, Th and U, allowing to aspirate a dry sample aerosol into the ICP-QMS. A pneumatic cross flow nebulizer served as sample introduction device for the other elements. Internal standardization was achieved with 103 Rh for all elements, except for Th whose ICP-QMS signals were corrected by Rh- 103 and Re- 185. Quality control was ascertained by analysis of the certified plant reference material GBW 07602 Bush Branches and Leaves. In almost all cases HNO 3 alone could not fully liberate the analytes of interest from the peat or plant matrix, probably because of the silicates present. After adding small amounts (0. 05 - 0. 1 ml) of either HF or HBF 4 to the digestion mixture, concentrations quantified by ICP-QMS generally increased significantly, {{in the case of}} Rb up to 80 %. Further increasing the volumes of HF or HBF 4 in turn, resulted in a loss of recoveries of almost all elements, some of which amounted to approximately 60 %. The successful analytical procedures were applied to the determination of two bulk peat materials. In general, good agreement between the found concentrations and results from an inter-laboratory trial or from instrumental neutron activation data were obtained, underpinning the suitability of the developed analytical approach.

40|$|Analytical {{procedures}} for the determination of rare earth elements (REE) in 250 mg aliquots of difficult-to-digest peat and plant matrices by ICP-MS were developed. Three different pressurised digestion approaches were tested for this purpose, namely (i) closed vessel acid digestion on a hot-plate at 180 degreesC, (ii) digestion in a microwave high pressure autoclave at a temperature of 240 degreesC and (iii) high pressure ashing (HPA) at a temperature of 320 degreesC. Acid mixtures for digestion contained concentrated nitric acid (3 - 5 ml) alone or additions of hydrofluoric acid (HF) or <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid</b> (HBF 4) at volumes of 0. 05 - 1. 0 ml. The selection of appropriate volumes of HF or HBF 4 {{was identified as a}} critical step in obtaining accurate results. For several reasons, HBF 4 is preferred in comparison with the normally used addition of HF for the destruction of siliceous matter in the samples investigated. The optimum acid mixture consisted of 3 ml of HNO 3 and 0. 1 ml of HBF 4. High sample throughput (40 samples simultaneously in about 2 h) favours the microwave autoclave over the other two digestion systems. An ultrasonic nebuliser (USN) with membrane desolvation used for sample introduction reduced the spectral interferences originating from oxide formation of lighter REE and Ba to a negligible extent. Internal standardisation with Rh and Re proved to be essential for obtaining correct results. In this way, all REE could be reliably quantified by USN-ICP-MS without applying any mathematical correction equations. The accuracy of the optimised procedures was assessed by the determination of REE in digests of the certified reference material GBW 07602 Bush Branches and Leaves and of the candidate reference material CRM 670 Aquatic Plant. The developed analytical procedures were applied to the determination of REE in two different peat matrices. Results for these peat samples obtained by USN-ICP-MS showed good agreement with INAA values. Strong fractionation of REE caused by the addition of HF or HBF 4 in excess, known as lanthanide contraction, could be experimentally established, except for europium, which revealed a different behaviour...|$|E

40|$|This thesis details an {{investigation}} into the development of a novel annulation reaction for the synthesis of bridged ring systems. Using the Nicholas reaction, that is, the reaction of a stabilised dicobált hexacarbonyl propargyl cation with an intramolecular nucleophile, cyclisation was achieved to suggest a novel variant of this reaction. In all examples studied, the variant key step involved a double bond isomerisation of the pendant alkenyl nucleophile, that led to the observed novel allylic anion mediated attack onto the cobalt stabilised cation. In addition, the observed incorporation of a halogen atom observed in the cyclised product, further contributed to the novel variance of this reaction. After the initial discussion, a review of the biological importance and past synthetic approaches for the construction of the bridged ring system in taxane, aphidicolane, stemodane and gibanne families is given. This is followed by a general review of the cobalt-alkyne chemistry, that details the structure and properties of the cobalt-alkyne complex and its chemistry in context with the Nicholas reaction. The results of these investigations into this novel methodology is then detailed. These studies commenced with the successful cyclisation of a 1, 3 -difunctionalised cycloalkane. The reaction between the dicobalt hexacarbonyl complexed propynyl alcohol and the pendant pentenyl group, gave in the presence of titanium (IV) chloride, the chloro-substituted bicyclo[3. 3. l]nonane ring system. When conducting preIiminary studies into the mechanism for the reaction, that initially involved {{an investigation}} into the halogen atom incorporation, additional cyclisation was observed. Using the Lewis acids, titanium (IV) bromide and titanium (IV) fluoride, the successful syntheses of the bromo- and fluoro-substituted bicyclo[3. 3. l]nonanes were achieved respectively. In addition to this, the consequence of. using other Lewis acids, that included boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, <b>tetrafluoroboric</b> <b>acid,</b> tin (IV) chloride and zinc chloride, is also discussed. The investigations were continued with optimising the reaction conditions for the cyclisation step. An examination into the effect of changing the solvent, temperature, reaction time, and the stoichiometry of the Lewis acid is included. During the course of these studies, a range of decomplexing agents was also examined. In extending these investigations, the generality of this protocol was looked into. The consequence of reducing the pendant alkenyl group in the 1, 3 -difunctionalised cycloalkane, led to the successful synthesis of other bicyclic systems. This included bicyclo[3. 2. 1]octane and bicyclo[4. 3. 1]decane. A subsequent study in which the size of the first ring was changed, led to the synthesis of 5, 6 and 7, 6 - bridge ring systems. In the later stages of the research programme, a stereoselective approach for the synthesis of bicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane, using the precursor derived from (S) -(+) -carvone was studied, in which no significant stereoselective control was achieved. Additional work involving procedures undertaken to obtain a crystalline derivative to determine the absolute stereochemistry for the bicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane system is also included. In conclusion to these studies, {{an investigation into}} the synthesis of the challenging 6, 8 membered ring system, present in taxol, is discussed. Preliminary results for this study, show that success may have been achieved...|$|E
