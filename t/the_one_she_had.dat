25|$|The {{programme}} has {{its roots}} firmly in the desire of Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner to get Elisabeth Sladen back into the TARDIS. He had wanted her to have the contract eventually awarded to Janet Fielding in late 1980. John Nathan-Turner's preferred plan for the transition from Baker to Davison was to have Sarah Jane be {{along for the ride}} from Logopolis to the second story of series 19. However, Sladen had no interest in returning simply to reprise a role and function identical to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left years before.|$|E
25|$|Other musicians, such as Pink and Gwen Stefani, were advertised and {{scheduled}} {{to perform on}} the show, but neither of their performances were aired. Although their numbers were pre-taped {{along with the other}} guests', American Idol claimed they were not broadcast due to time constraints, but that their appearances will be featured in future episodes of the show. Gwen Stefani sang during the season finale, however it was a performance aired via satellite, and not <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> pre-recorded for Idol Gives Back. Pink's performance was shown on one of the later episodes of the season.|$|E
25|$|In 1884 Van and Ada, age 14 and 12, fall passionately in love, {{and their}} affair {{is marked by}} a {{powerful}} sense of romantic eroticism. The book opens with their discovery that they are in fact not cousins but brother and sister. The passage is notoriously difficult, more so as neither of them explicitly states the conclusion they have drawn (treating it as obvious), and it is only referred to in passing later in the text. Although Ada's mother keeps a wedding photo dated August 1871, eleven months before her birth, they find in a box in the attic a newspaper announcement dating the wedding to December 1871; and furthermore that Dan had been abroad since that spring, as proved by his extensive filmreels. Hence he is not Ada's father. Furthermore, they find an annotated flower album kept by Marina in 1869–70 which indicates, very obliquely, that she was pregnant and confined to a sanatorium {{at the same time as}} Aqua; that 99 orchids were delivered to Marina, from Demon, on Van's birthday; and that Aqua had a miscarriage in a skiing accident. It later transpires that Marina gave the child to her sister to replace <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lost—so she is in fact Van's mother—and that her affair with Demon continued until Ada's conception. This makes Lucette (Dan and Marina's child) the uterine half-sister of both of them.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the early}} turning points for the {{character}} came in season one's [...] "X-Ray", when Lana discovers information about her parents that changes her perspective on them. It began with her mother's graduation speech, which showed {{that her mother was}} not as happy as her aunt had led her to believe. Lana's perception of her mother drove the way she led her own life, which was based on the idea of everyone perceiving her in a good light. In season two, Lana discovers that her mother had had an affair with a man named Henry Small, and that he was her biological father. This continued the idea established in season one that Lana's perception that her parents were this perfect couple was wrong. According to Kreuk, meeting her biological father allowed the character to realize that she had to create her own life, as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> envisioned did not actually exist.|$|E
500|$|In Miami, Florida, Furtado {{collaborated with}} Pharrell (who {{introduced}} her to reggaeton and who gave her a [...] "shout-out" [...] in his 2005 single [...] "Can I Have It Like That") and Scott Storch (with whom she recorded a [...] "straight-up rap song") before entering the studio with Timbaland. He and his protégé at the time, Danja, co-produced eight of the tracks, with another produced solely by Danja. For some of the beats on the songs, Timbaland finished work on ones already present in the studio that were half-developed or just [...] "nucleuses"; the rest were completely reworked. Furtado recorded around forty tracks for Loose, deciding which she would include based on the s of the album—she called Timbaland [...] "a sonic extraterrestrial" [...] {{who came up with}} a sequence of songs that flowed, and said that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> devised was supposedly unsatisfactory. She recorded an unreleased collaboration with Justin Timberlake, [...] "Crowd Control", which she described as [...] "kind of sexy" [...] and [...] "a cute, clubby, upbeat, fun track". Other songs considered for inclusion on the album include [...] "Chill Boy", [...] "Friend of Mine", [...] "Go", [...] "Hands in the Air", [...] "Pretty Boy", [...] "Vice" [...] and [...] "Weak".|$|E

2500|$|The exit of Treadwell from Vaughan's {{life was}} precipitated by {{the entry of}} Clyde [...] "C.B." [...] Atkins, a man of {{uncertain}} background whom she had met in Chicago and married on September 4, 1959. Although Atkins had no experience in artist management or music, Vaughan wished to have a mixed professional and personal relationship like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> with Treadwell. She made Atkins her personal manager, although she was still feeling the sting of the problems she had with Treadwell and initially kept a slightly closer eye on Atkins. Vaughan and Atkins moved into a house in Englewood, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Deutsch {{retired as}} a {{training}} analyst {{in part due to}} her husband, Felix’s, declining health and memory loss. In 1963, Felix Deutsch died. Following his death, Helene Deutsch began to reminisce about her life with Felix and all that he had given her. Her relationship with Felix, up to that point, had always been a little bit strained. Through numerous affairs, like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> with Sándor Rado, Deutsch had always felt that Felix was more of the mother figure than she. According to Deutsch, [...] "Felix seemed to have no trouble in 'naturally' displaying all the motherly ease. Even in situations in which a child usually calls for his mother, [...] turned more often to Felix than to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1922, Tsvetaeva and Ariadna {{left the}} Soviet Union and were reunited with Efron in Berlin, {{whom she had}} thought killed by the Bolsheviks. There she {{published}} the collections Separation, Poems to Blok, and the poem The Tsar Maiden, much of her poetry appeared in Moscow and Berlin, consolidating her reputation. In August 1922, {{the family moved to}} Prague. Living in unremitting poverty, unable to afford living accommodation in Prague itself, with Efron studying politics and sociology at the Charles University and living in hostels, Tsvetaeva and Ariadna found rooms in a village outside the city. She writes [...] "we are devoured by coal, gas, the milkman, the baker...the only meat we eat is horsemeat". When offered an opportunity to earn money by reading her poetry, she describes having to beg a simple dress from a friend to replace <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been living in.|$|E

Now, the two are second-year high school students, but Hotaru is {{anything}} but innocent. Yuma gets her first boyfriend and is nervous about it, so a more experienced Hotaru suggests a [...] "dress rehearsal" [...] to help her out. The helping out later on leads to a deep kiss with Hotaru, who says that Yuma now knows how to kiss a guy. This leaves her thinking about how much better this kiss was than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> shared with her boyfriend. As time goes on, Yuma worries that her boyfriend will {{find out what is}} going on between her and Hotaru.

2500|$|... 2013–4: Boston Children's Hospital {{became part}} of a dispute between medical doctors, the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and {{the parents of a}} teenager, Justina Pelletier.

Boston Children's Hospital requested that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Children and Families protect and remove the patient from her parent's custody, due to concern for a situation of [...] "medical child abuse." [...] At the request of the Department of Children and Families and Boston Children's Hospital officials, the girl was made a ward of the state of Massachusetts. Justina Pelletier was held in Boston Children's Hospital's psychiatric ward, Bader 5, from February 14, 2013, until January 2014, when she was transferred to Wayside Youth and Family Support Network, a residential treatment center in Framingham.
