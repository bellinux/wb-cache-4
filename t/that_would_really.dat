5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> happen.|$|E
500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve gave you the opportunities to do things <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> be memorable, if you could sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> {{be the way to}} break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.|$|E

500|$|Working {{closely with}} Midway Games (which {{developed}} four launch titles for the system) and {{taking advantage of}} the ten months following the Dreamcast's release in Japan, Sega of America worked to ensure a more successful U.S. launch with a minimum of 15 launch games. Despite lingering bitterness over the Saturn's early release, Stolar successfully managed to repair relations with major US retailers, with whom Sega presold 300,000 Dreamcast units. In addition, a pre-launch promotion enabled consumers to rent the system from Hollywood Video in the months preceding its September launch. Sega of America's senior vice president of marketing Peter Moore, a fan of the attitude previously associated with Sega's brand, worked with Foote, Cone & Belding and Access Communications to develop the [...] "It's Thinking" [...] campaign of 15-second television commercials, which emphasized the Dreamcast's hardware power. According to Moore, [...] "We needed to create something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> intrigue consumers, somewhat apologize for the past, but invoke all the things we loved about Sega, primarily from the Genesis days." [...] On August 11, Sega of America confirmed that Stolar had been fired, leaving Moore to direct the launch.|$|E
500|$|Amy Pettifer of The Quietus {{said the}} song is [...] "scuzzy and {{repetitive}} with a danceable hook—but her voice is at its thinnest and the dynamics a little lacking. Despite all this, it does contain the great lyric, 'It's time to dance and turn this dark into something', which could be the album's epigram." [...] Lee DeVito of Metro Times called it [...] "a bit repetitive" [...] but said it is probably his favorite track on the album. Saeed Saeed of The National said he favored the album's version over its demo, and that, [...] "hankfully, Kanye West rescued it by throwing out the lameness and added the dark and claustrophobic sounds of his seminal 2013 album Yeezus". Bernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald said it is [...] "colder and harder sounding, {{in the way of}} West's own recent work. There's some edge to it but not much menace <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> thrust it into compelling." [...] For Kitty Empire of The Guardian said [...] "Rebel Hearts key collaboration with Kanye West finds two of pop's biggest egomaniacs starring in a wiggly club banger that doubles as a take-down of the internet's most nutzoid meme". Mark Lore of Paste called it [...] "dark and creepy, and it's one of the best tracks on Rebel Heart".|$|E
2500|$|When Grey {{told his}} friend Lichnowsky that [...] "Any nation that {{accepted}} conditions like <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> cease to count {{as an independent}} nation", Wilhelm wrote on the margin of Lichnowsky’s report [...] "That would be very desirable. It [...] is not a nation in the European sense, but a band of robbers!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bioethicist Alice Dreger {{studied the}} {{reactions}} of trans activists and other controversies in her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger. She argued that although the science appears correct that eroticism is behind the typology of transgenderism, activists in the trans community preferred the simpler narrative of literally being one sex trapped {{in the body of}} the other. [...] Dreger says, [...] "Autogynephilia is perhaps best understood as a love <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> rather we didn’t speak its name", in reference to the famous expression the love that dare not speak its name formerly used to refer to homosexuality or pederasty.|$|E
2500|$|Garcia was well-noted for his [...] "soulful {{extended}} guitar improvisations", {{which would}} frequently feature interplay {{between him and}} his fellow band members. His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice. Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that [...] "there are some [...] kinds of ideas <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [...] innovative bass playing. Weir's ability to solve that sort of problem is extraordinary. [...] Harmonically, I take a lot of my solo cues from Bob." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 25, 2006, Colbert {{responded to}} {{television}} networks—specifically Fox News, NBC's The Today Show and ABC's Good Morning America—which took {{comments made by}} Florida Congressman Robert Wexler on The Colbert Report out of context (e.g.: [...] "I enjoy cocaine and the company of prostitutes because they are a fun thing to do."). Wexler, who ran unopposed in the then-upcoming election, made the comments in response to urging by Colbert that he [...] "say some things <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> lose the election for [...] if [...] were contested." [...] Colbert criticized the major networks' morning news shows that featured the interview in a misleading and a negative light, by showing clips {{from many of the}} [...] "fluff" [...] pieces they favored instead of [...] "real" [...] news. Colbert subsequently told his viewers to [...] "vote Wexler, the man's got a sense of humor, unlike, evidently, journalists." ...|$|E

2500|$|The cover art for {{the album}} is an adapted version of Bowie's 1977 album, [...] "Heroes", with a white square with the album's title {{obscuring}} Bowie's face. Designed by Jonathan Barnbrook, who also designed packaging for Heathen and Reality and follow-up Blackstar, the obscuring of the photograph connotes [...] "forgetting or obliterating the past". The original cover image was shot by Masayoshi Sukita. Barnbrook explained the cover, saying: [...] "If {{you are going to}} subvert an album by David Bowie there are many to choose from but this is one of his most revered, it had to be an image <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> jar if it were subverted in some way and we thought [...] "Heroes" [...] worked best on all counts." [...] A viral marketing campaign was launched to promote the album on 15 February 2013. The campaign grew out of the concept behind the album cover, taking seemingly ordinary images and subverting them through the addition of a white square.|$|E
