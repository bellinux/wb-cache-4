25|$|After {{asking a}} flight {{attendant}} for permission to move to seat 26K, saying {{he could get a}} better view from that seat, Yousef moved to that seat and <b>tucked</b> <b>the</b> assembled bomb into the life vest pocket under that seat. He exited the aircraft in Cebu. Philippine domestic Flight Attendant Maria De La Cruz noticed that Yousef had switched seats {{during the course of the}} Manila to Cebu flight and got off the plane in Cebu with the domestic cabin crew, but did not pass the information along to the international flight crew that boarded at Cebu for the trip to Tokyo. 25 other passengers also got off the plane at Cebu, where 256 more passengers and a new cabin crew boarded the plane for the final leg of the flight to Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, George is {{ineligible for}} service {{because of his}} bad ear. Harry becomes a Navy pilot and shoots down a kamikaze plane that would have bombed an amphibious transport; he is awarded the Medal of Honor. On Christmas Eve morning 1945, the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry. Uncle Billy goes to Potter's bank to deposit $8,000 for the Building and Loan. (The $8,000 was worth over $100,000 in 2017 dollars.) He teases Potter, taking his {{newspaper}} and bragging about Harry being on the front page; the banker angrily grabs the newspaper, inside of which Billy has unintentionally <b>tucked</b> <b>the</b> envelope containing the money. Upon seeing the money, Potter realizes the potential scandal {{could lead to the}} Building and Loan's downfall. Potter hides the money, knowing its loss will cause severe financial problems for the Building and Loan. When Uncle Billy cannot find the money, he and George frantically search for it. When the bank examiner arrives to review their records, George berates his uncle for endangering the Building and Loan, goes home and takes out his frustration on his family. He apologizes to his wife and children, then leaves.|$|E

25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's trochoid chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the semi-monocoque frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used to lubricate the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply <b>tucked</b> <b>the</b> pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the main bearings and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E

5000|$|Some men use the {{waistband}} {{in order to}} hide a bulge {{in order to avoid}} embarrassment. During an erection, this is done by jutting it upwards beneath {{the waistband}}.
