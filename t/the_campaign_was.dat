Carlsen, playing white, won in 43 moves. In February 2014, {{he appeared in}} G-Star Raw's Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> usually {{originated}} and {{at least}} initially concocted internally by a media organization with a particular agenda in mind, within a closed loop of reportage and opinionation, <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> said to have [...] "pulled itself up by its own bootstraps".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to create a dialogue {{about the problem of}} litter, creating a foundation to build awareness and affect long-term behavior change. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> being executed across the country through Keep America Beautiful’s national network of affiliates, which bring <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> to <b>the</b> streets at public events and through traditional media.|$|R
5|$|On this basis, an anti-drug {{campaign}} was initiated by Baba lovers in the United States, Europe and Australia.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{abandoned}} while Michael and Basil {{returned to}} Constantinople, where Michael adopted {{his friend and}} made him co-emperor.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{perceived}} as a decisive Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command {{and the birth of}} heroic tales in Israel.

5|$|The {{first game}} of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> against Lithuanian team FK Sūduva. Sūduva stated {{that they could not}} send a scout to Glasgow to spy on Celtic to prepare for their match, and instead had to watch videotapes of their opponents.|$|E
5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any way he could.|$|E
40|$|Disasters {{related to}} natural hazards have {{increased}} {{in the last few}} decades. This increment makes it necessary to develop non-structural risk prevention and mitigation measures to improve people’s safety. An effective non-structural measure that can improve the preparedness of the population is a locally adapted communication <b>campaign</b> that <b>is</b> focused on natural hazards. We have developed a hypothetical communication campaign for a specific area in the north of Italy, in which hydro-geological risk is of considerable importance. The content of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> defined by <b>the</b> combination of the requirements of the law with the results of a survey conducted in the study area. The aim of the survey is to evaluate the level of risk perception among the residents, and their attitudes towards prevention activities. The operative procedure of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> modeled on advertising strategies. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> designed to reach each family, and it is aimed at affecting people’s everyday life through a horizontal communication strategy that involves flyers, billboards, umbrellas and a website. The use of umbrellas as a medium for <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> key. People mostly use umbrellas when it rains. Rain is linked with hydrogeological risk. As the content of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> printed on <b>the</b> umbrellas, each time people use these umbrellas, they remember <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> integrated into a broader communication program that includes meetings with stakeholders, activities in schools, and public conferences. The final goal is to foster the creation of a shared knowledge about risk in the whole population. </p...|$|R
50|$|Expenses for <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>were</b> $197,641.00, {{resulting}} in a deficit of $7,260.04.|$|R

Other major gifts included funding of faculty and nursing classes at King's Daughters Medical Center, the Booth Foundation, Saul and Harriett Kaplan Foundation scholarships, Lincoln and Katherine and Scott scholarships and partial funding of evening nursing classes at Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital.

5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised. The churchwardens and the MPGA began to consider ideas for initiatives which would publicise {{the campaign and}} provide a reason to justify preserving {{the whole of the}} park.|$|E
5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability {{by the political}} and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{a disaster for the}} ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E

5|$|Bo's {{tenure in}} Chongqing was {{dominated}} by a protracted war against organized crime and corruption known as dahei ("striking the black"). Between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 5,700 people were arrested in the sweeping campaign that ensnared not only criminals, but also businessmen, members of the police force, judges, government officials, and political adversaries. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> overseen by Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, whom Bo had worked with previously in Liaoning.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy {{early for the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the gold standard or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{used the}} Ministry of Information's electoral {{education}} campaign as a partisan political tool.

After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act.

5|$|Garnering a {{great degree}} of {{attention}} from the Mighty Ducks' fanbase, Kariya's first public practice at Arrowhead Pond drew an attendance of 9,000, while 16,000 fans watched his first exhibition game.
