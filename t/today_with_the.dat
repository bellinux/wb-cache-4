However, an agnatic but illegitimate male line still exists <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> current Duke of Beaufort.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was assumed}} in 1937, {{following}} {{the merger of}} the Department of Northern Development (DND) into the Department of Highways (DHO), predecessor to the modern Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). It travelled from what was then Highway11 (Main Street) in downtown North Bay northeast to its present terminus. The highway follows the same route <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of the westernmost , which were transferred to the City of North Bay in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, Griffin {{became a}} {{political}} worker at the National Front headquarters. As a teenager he had accompanied {{his father to}} a National Front meeting, and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party. He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979, and several years later worked with white power skinhead band, Skrewdriver. In 1980, he {{became a member of}} the party's governing body, the National Directorate, and in the same year launched Nationalism <b>Today</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aid of Joe Pearce, then editor of the NF youth paper Bulldog. As a National Front member, Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in the 1981 by-election and 1983 general election, securing 1.2% and 0.9% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist <b>today.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much as it is <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of the high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E

5|$|During the Triassic {{period of}} some 251–199.6Ma, the Indian subcontinent {{was part of}} a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea. Despite its {{position}} within a high-latitude belt at 55–75°S—latitudes now occupied by parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35°N—India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons. India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana, a process beginning some 550–500Ma. During the Late Paleozoic, Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator, where the Indian craton (stable continental crust) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-biomass ecosystems. This is underscored by India's vast coal reserves—much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence—the fourth-largest reserves in the world. During the Mesozoic, the world, including India, was considerably warmer than <b>today.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> coming of the Carboniferous, global cooling stoked extensive glaciation, which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the Permian.|$|E
5|$|In Schenectady County, Schoharie Creek {{breaks from}} NY30A {{and returns to}} the {{vicinity}} of NY30 as it intersects U.S. Route20 (US20) in Esperance. From Esperance northward, the creek becomes roughly equidistant from both NY30 and NY30A as all three entities cross into Montgomery County. Near the northeastern corner of the county, NY30 enters the city of Amsterdam. The route meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY5S via separate interchanges before heading downhill as a four-lane divided highway approaching the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal). Historically, the bridge over the river was a straight line to Market Street, which is visible as one approaches northbound. Segments of downtown Market Street remain in use <b>today.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> 1977 creation of the Amsterdam Mall, NY30, together with NY5 and NY67, were re-routed onto splits. After the splits rejoin, NY30 continues on Market Street and leaves the city and, for all purposes, the county.|$|E
