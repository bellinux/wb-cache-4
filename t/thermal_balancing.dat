40|$|The strong {{trend toward}} nanosatellites creates new {{challenges}} {{in terms of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>balance</b> control. The <b>thermal</b> <b>balance</b> of a satellite {{is determined by the}} heat dissipation in its subsystems and by the thermal connections between them.

40|$|Among {{the factors}} causing intradialytic haemody-namic instability, dialysate {{temperature}} {{has been shown}} to play a relevant role. An improved car-diovascular response during isolated ultrafiltration or with cooled dialysate has been described in the past. Cold dialysate may increase the external heat loss compensating for the increase in core temperature, thus avoiding vasodilatation, but it also increases myocardial contractility. However, a better haemody-namic response to dialysis treatment has long been known in convective therapies as well, and the hypothesis of a leading role for <b>thermal</b> <b>balance</b> is under discussion. In conventional haemofiltration (HF), venous blood cooling is expected, {{on the basis of the}} infusate temperature and the filtration fraction. In on-line HF, the infusate temperature and its volume may have a different impact on <b>thermal</b> <b>balance</b> depending on the site of infusion (pre- or post-dialyser). In an in vitro study comparing haemodialysis (HD) (conventional HD, dialysate 37 C; and cold HD, dialysate 35. 5 C) with HF (pre- and post-dilution, 37 C), we observed a more negative <b>thermal</b> <b>balance</b> with cold HD (130 kJ/h) and with post-dilution HF (75 kJ/h). The beneficial pressor effects of HF have been confirmed even in on-line HF, which actually has very few differences in the <b>thermal</b> <b>balance</b> compared with conventional HD (dialysate 37 C). In on-line HF, the amount of warm infusion, often exceeding the blood flow, makes the achievement of a negative <b>thermal</b> <b>balance</b> highly unlikely. Thus, there is not sufficient evidence that vascular stability in on-line HF is solely related to different <b>thermal</b> energy <b>balances.</b> Other factors playing a relevant role in the cardio-circulatory response to convective dialysis should thus be considered...|$|R

40|$|Water-loop {{heat pump}} (WLHP) systems are an {{important}} option for space conditioning of commercial buildings. They provide the opportunity of saving energy through heat recovery and <b>thermal</b> <b>balancing</b> when heating and cooling occur simultaneously. WLHP systems typically operate with loop water temperature between 16 C and 32 C.

The proposed balancing controller is devised by investigating structural properties of constrained linear quadratic (LQ) model predictive controller (MPC) introduced in our earlier study.

40|$|Abstract. 3 D stacked chips {{have become}} a {{promising}} integration technology for modern systems. The complexity reached in multi-processor systems has increased the communication delays between processing cores, and {{an effective way to}} diminish this impact on communication is the 3 D integration technol-ogy and the use of through-silicon vias (TSVs) for inter-layer communication. However, 3 D chips present important ther- mal issues due to the presence of processing units with a high power density, which are not homogeneously dis-tributed in the stack. Also, the presence of hot-spots creates thermal gradients that impact negatively on the system reliability and relate with the leakage power consumption. Thus, new approaches for thermal control of 3 D chips are in great need. This paper discusses the use of a grid and non-uniform placement of TSVs as an effective mechanism for <b>thermal</b> <b>balancing</b> and control in 3 D chips. We have modelled the material layers and TSVs mathematically using a detailed calibration phase based on a real 5 -tier 3 D chip stack, where several heaters and sensors are manufactured to study the heat diffusion.
