Saggers made his {{first-class}} debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after <b>the</b> <b>resumption,</b> was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E

5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which <b>the</b> <b>Resumption</b> Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of <b>the</b> <b>Resumption</b> Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter.

40|$|We study a {{model of}} side-effecting {{processes}} obtained by starting from a monad modelling base effects and adjoining free operations using a cofree coalgebra construction; one thus arrives at what one may think of as types of non-wellfounded side-effecting trees, generalizing <b>the</b> infinite <b>resumption</b> monad.

Monads of this kind have received some attention in the recent literature; in particular, {{it has been shown}} that they admit guarded iteration. Here, we show that they also admit unguarded iteration, i. e. form complete Elgot monads, provided that the underlying base effect supports unguarded iteration.
