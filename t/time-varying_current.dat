50|$|A {{critical}} {{issue in the}} analysis of power grids is the large size of the network (typically millions of nodes in a state-of-the-art microprocessor). Simulating all the non-linear devices in the chip together with the power grid is computationally infeasible. To make the size manageable, the simulation is done in two steps. First, the non-linear devices are simulated assuming perfect supply voltages and the currents drawn by the devices are measured. Next, these devices are modeled as independent <b>time-varying</b> <b>current</b> sources for simulating the power grid and the voltage drops at the transistors are measured. Since voltage drops are typically less than 10% of the power supply voltage, the error incurred by ignoring the interaction between the device currents and the supply voltage is small. By doing these two steps, the power grid analysis problem reduces to solving a linear network which is still quite large. To further reduce the network size, we can exploit the hierarchy in the power distribution models.|$|E

Glider submersibles are highly sensitive to prevailing currents so mission planners must account for ocean tides and eddies.

40|$|To {{understand}} sensory processing in neuronal populations, it {{is necessary}} to deliver stimuli to the sensory organs of animals and record evoked population activity downstream. However, the pathways from sensory input to synaptic currents in cells that are several synapses removed from sensory organs are complex. Intrinsic noise and uncontrolled modulatory input from other brain regions can interfere with the delivery of well-defined stimuli. Here we investigate the ability of channelrhodopsins to deliver precise <b>time-varying</b> <b>currents</b> to neurons at any point along the sensory-motor pathway. To do this, we first deduce the amplitude response function of channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) using a three state Markov model of channel kinetics. With biophysically realistic parameters, this function supports a relatively broad signal passband and contains a resonance. We confirm the validity of our predicted amplitude response function using time-varying optical stimulation of excitatory neurons that express either wild type ChR 2 or the ChR 2 (H 134 R) mutant. Together, our results indicate that ChR 2 -derived optogenetic tools are useful for delivering repeatable, <b>time-varying</b> <b>currents</b> to genetically-specified populations over a physiologically-relevant frequency band.

40|$|Abstract Background Magnetic {{stimulation}} {{has gained}} relatively wide application in studying nervous system structures. This technology {{has the advantage}} of reduced excitation of sensory nerve endings, and hence results in quasi-painless action. It has become clinically accepted modality for brain stimulation. However, theoretical and practical solutions for assessment of induced current distribution need more detailed and accurate consideration. Some possible analyses are proposed for distribution of the current induced from excitation current contours of different shape and disposition. Relatively non-difficult solutions are shown, applicable for two- and three-dimensional analysis. Methods The boundary conditions for field analysis by the internal Dirichlet problem are introduced, based on the vector potential field excited by external current coils. The feedback from the induced eddy currents is neglected. Finite element modeling is applied for obtaining the electromagnetic fields distribution in a non-homogeneous domain. Results The distributions were obtained in a non-homogeneous structure comprised of homogeneous layers. A tendency was found of the induced currents to follow paths in lower resistivity layers, deviating from the expected theoretical course for a homogeneous domain. Current density concentrations occur at the boundary between layers, suggesting the possibility for focusing on, or predicting of, a zone of stimulation. Conclusion The theoretical basis and simplified approach for generation of 3 D FEM networks for magnetic stimulation analysis are presented, applicable in non-homogeneous and non-linear media. The inconveniences of introducing external excitation currents are avoided.
