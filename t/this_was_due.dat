5|$|A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle {{went on to}} {{face each}} other in a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice. This bout was {{announced}} on the July31 episode of Impact!, when Styles challenged Angle to a match at Hard Justice to end their rivalry. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to Angle assaulting Styles from behind earlier in the episode. Styles defeated Angle at the event.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Puerto Rico, {{the hurricane}} passed {{just north of}} the Dominican Republic, producing very little damage. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center.

5|$|An {{official}} 2-CD soundtrack album for the game, Mobius Final Fantasy Original Soundtrack, {{was released}} through Square Enix's music label on February 26, 2015 under the catalog number SQEX-10534-5. The {{music on the}} album covers Chapters 1 to 3. According to Suzuki, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the music feeling like it had reached a natural transition point by that stage of the game.|$|E

5|$|Became {{the first}} player in history with more times on base (376) than {{official}} at-bats (373) in 2004. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the record number of walks, which count as a time on base but not an at-bat. He had 135 hits, 232 walks, and 9 hit-by-pitches for the 376 number.|$|E
5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to {{the differences between the}} masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant shortfall in many items. In part <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, as he {{was writing}} Parts II and IV, Joyce's {{progress}} slowed considerably. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> {{to a number of}} factors including {{the death of his father}} John Stanislaus Joyce in 1931; concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia; and his own health problems, chiefly his failing eyesight.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964–65 Football League Championship, Liverpool {{dropped from}} first to seventh with 13 fewer points than the {{previous}} season. According to the Liverpool site, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the exertion of lengthy participation in the FA and European Cups.|$|E

5|$|Lem {{singled out}} only one American science fiction writer for praise, Philip K. Dick, {{for example in}} his 1986 English-language {{anthology}} of his critical essays, Microworlds. In fact, initially Lem held an equally low opinion of Philip K. Dick together with the bulk of American science fiction, explaining later <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to limited familiarity with Dick's work.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines retired the Flight 370 (MH370) {{flight number}} and {{replaced}} it with Flight 318 (MH318) beginning 14 March. This follows a common practice among airlines to rename flights following notorious accidents. The flight—Malaysia Airline's second daily flight to Beijing—was later suspended beginning 2 May; according to insiders, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to lack of demand.|$|E

5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the relatively few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
5|$|The Romanian Army {{entered the}} Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, {{allowing}} Romania to annex Southern Dobruja (also {{known as the}} Cadrilater). Although some 330,000 troops were mobilised, the Romanians met little resistance in Bulgaria and as such this is not considered a major conflict in Romanian history. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to historical claims on land. This area no longer belongs to Romania.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} bronze medals awarded {{was greater than}} either the gold or silver. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> {{to a number of}} dead heats for third position, {{including}} the women's 100 meter hurdles and men's pole vault. Also, a second bronze medal was awarded for each of the boxing and judo events as there were no third/fourth position tiebreakers held.|$|E

5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{itself had}} no notable effect on {{relations between the}} people and the occupying Americans, which were already deteriorating as the siege dragged on. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> in part {{to the fact that the}} Americans, rather than paying for their supplies in coin, paid with Continental paper currency or promissory notes, deemed to be of little worth by the locals.|$|E
5|$|A mockup of the cockpit, center {{fuselage}} and wing {{center section}} was built and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E
