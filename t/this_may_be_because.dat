5|$|In some church {{records the}} town is {{referred}} to as 'Norton Canonicorum' as an alternative to Midsomer Norton, and <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the local Priory's link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1546.|$|E
5|$|Phineas is {{also very}} modest. He tends to put Ferb's name on inventions. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Ferb {{does most of the}} building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
50|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} {{are extremely}} common in society. One {{of the reasons}} <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>is</b> simply <b>because</b> it <b>is</b> easier on the brain to stereotype (see Heuristics).|$|R

50|$|Tro tro {{are used}} by 70% of Ghanaian commuters. <b>This</b> {{popularity}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> {{in cities such as}} Accra have no public transportation system save for these small minibuses.|$|R
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. Unlike many other primates, male orangutans {{do not seem}} to practice infanticide. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E
5|$|Low immune {{function}} {{has also been}} implicated in endometrial cancer. High blood pressure is also a risk factor, but <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 18th century chief Dugald MacCallum, the ninth of Poltalloch changed his surname to Malcolm. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> he {{inherited}} the Malcolm estates in 1779.|$|R
50|$|Eremophila delisseri {{occurs on}} the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia. It was {{previously}} thought {{to grow in}} Western Australia but <b>this</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> of errors in determining precise location. It grows in calcareous loam.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the colony of New South Wales, it was {{sometimes}} known as Stonequarry Cove and Stone Quarry Creek. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> there <b>was</b> once a nearby quarry in Five Dock.|$|R
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
50|$|Many {{references}} to Flight 320 {{claim that there}} were 72 persons on board {{and that there were}} only seven survivors. <b>This</b> error <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> one victim <b>was</b> a lap infant and did not have its own seat or ticket.|$|R
50|$|A few {{utilities}} are permanently marked with short posts or bollards, mainly for lines carrying petroleum products. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> done <b>because</b> of venting requirements, and also serves {{to indicate the}} location of underground facilities that are especially hazardous if disturbed.|$|R
50|$|The {{early history}} of the town is obscure. The Domesday Book of 1086 does not mention Ramsey. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> either <b>because</b> it <b>was</b> part of Bury or because it belonged to the abbey that, at that time, enjoyed royal privileges.|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> {{he was a child}} of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, and <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} {{situations in which}} chemical intermediates are synthesized in situ in various processes. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> done <b>because</b> the species <b>is</b> unstable, and cannot be isolated, or simply out of convenience. Examples of the former include the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent and adrenochrome.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} few {{sightings}} of either apparition since the early 20th Century. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> the Master in the 1930s, Sir Will Spens, {{let it be known}} that anyone complaining of a ghost would be sent down.|$|R
5000|$|Search engines invoke query {{expansion}} {{to increase}} the quality of user search results. It is assumed that users do not always formulate search queries using the best terms.

5|$|The mass {{distribution}} of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up {{nearly all of the}} mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan makes up more than 95% of the total mass. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.|$|E
5|$|Familial dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} systolic heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of mutations (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as well) is associated with DCM. The cTnC mutations associated with DCM thus far are Y5H, Q50R, D75Y, M103I, D145E (also associated with HCM), I148V, and G159D. Of these, Q50R and G159D co-segregated with disease in affected family members, increasing confidence that they are clinically significant mutations. The biochemical consequences of thin filament DCM-associated mutations are less well established than for HCM, {{although there has been}} some suggestion that some of the mutations abolish the calcium desensitizing effect of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/23. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> some mutations disrupt the precise positioning of cNTnC for triggering muscle contraction when cTnI is unphosphorylated.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11 is a sunlike {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Cygnus that has a mass of 0.95 (± 0.1) Msun and a radius of 1.1 (± 0.1) Rsun. In other words, Kepler-11 is approximately 5% less massive and 10% wider than the Sun. The star's metallicity is 0 (± 0.1), meaning {{that the level of}} iron (and, presumably, other elements) in the star is almost {{the same as that of}} the Sun. Metallicity plays an important role in planetary systems, and stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets detected around them. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the higher metallicity provides more material with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher metallicity increases planet migration towards the host star, making the planet easier to detect. The star has five other known planets in orbit: Kepler-11c, Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, Kepler-11f, and Kepler-11g. The first five planets in the system are all able to fit within the orbit of planet Mercury, while Kepler-11g orbits further out.|$|E

50|$|Switzerland {{features}} {{a system of}} government not seen in any other nation: direct representation, sometimes called half-direct democracy (<b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> arguable, <b>because</b> theoretically, the Sovereign of Switzerland is actually its entire electorate). Referenda {{on the most important}} laws have been used since the 1848 constitution.|$|R
5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E

50|$|Even so, under FGU {{the game}} languished. One {{supplement}} was published, but nothing further {{was done with}} the game. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> of FGU's focus on Chivalry & Sorcery, its primary fantasy RPG, or because of the unusual nature of Swordbearer's rules.|$|R
50|$|However, in 1886, {{the school}} was closed and the boys were {{transferred}} to Clongowes. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> of a shortage of priests, as the Jesuit House in Dromore, Co. Down closed the same year and Mungret College in Limerick had just been established.|$|R
