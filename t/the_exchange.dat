5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades.

At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him {{that he would have to}} close <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|The {{top section}} of Princes Street, from the Octagon to <b>the</b> <b>Exchange,</b> {{has long been}} the hub of Dunedin's public {{transport}} system. Buses from the north of the city largely pass along George Street and into the Octagon, those from the south pass into the southern end of Princes Street, and those from the hill suburbs arrive at the Octagon via Stuart Street or at <b>the</b> <b>Exchange</b> via High and Rattray Streets. Almost all of these use upper Princes Street between <b>the</b> <b>Exchange</b> and the Octagon as part of their route.|$|E

5|$|From the Octagon, Princes Street {{initially}} rises as {{it passes}} through a commercial district formerly {{commonly known as the}} Top 100, crossing the outer Octagon of Moray Place before descending through the original cutting of Bell Hill towards <b>the</b> <b>Exchange.</b> The Top 100 theoretically takes its name from the 100 retail businesses which line Princes Street from the Octagon to <b>the</b> <b>Exchange,</b> although the actual number of businesses is not one hundred. This part of the city is sometimes seen as the creative heart of Dunedin, with numerous art galleries, video production companies, and the city's professional theatre (the Fortune Theatre) all being based in the area from Moray Place to Rattray Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of <b>the</b> <b>Exchange</b> and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to <b>the</b> <b>Exchange</b> in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under the central part of <b>the</b> <b>Exchange.</b> Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E

Initial concerns that insurers might seek to enroll lower-risk customers outside <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> have not been realized. Instead, more-generous benefit plans, which appeal to people with health problems, constitute a greater portion of plans sold off-exchange than those sold on-exchange. Although insurers that sell mostly on <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> incur an additional fee, they still devote a greater portion of their premium dollars to medical care. Their projected administrative costs and profit margins are lower than are those of insurers selling only off <b>the</b> <b>exchanges...</b>|$|R

Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. <b>The</b> <b>exchange</b> eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms.
