5|$|In 2017, Gyorko {{became the}} Cardinals' regular third baseman. He hit 13 {{home runs in}} the first half of the season, but only six after <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E
5|$|Young entered <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> {{with the}} major league lead in ERA and {{opponent}} batting average {{as well as an}} undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals. Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of the five-game suspension. Young served his suspension during the final four games before <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> and the first game afterwards, yet was allowed to play in the All-Star Game at AT Park in San Francisco, California. In the fifth inning of the 5–4 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki.|$|E
5|$|Nova {{struggled}} at {{the beginning}} of the 2012 season, recording a 5.60 ERA through May, but decreased it to 3.92 by <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break.</b> During an interleague game against the Atlanta Braves on June 11, 2012, Nova got his first career base hit off of Randall Delgado in a 3–0 win. Nova was not very effective after <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break,</b> pitching to a 2–5 record with a 6.40 ERA in 10 starts, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to rotator cuff inflammation. Due to his struggles late in the season, the Yankees decided to demote Nova to the bullpen for the postseason roster until the team lost in the 2012 ALCS to the Detroit Tigers. Despite his 5.02 ERA, he still finished the 2012 season with a record of 12–8 in 28 starts.|$|E

25|$|Players' uniform {{numbers were}} listed—and in Tom Cheek's case, {{the number of}} {{consecutive}} games he called for the Blue Jays—until <b>the</b> 2013 <b>All-Star</b> <b>Break,</b> even though, {{with the exception of}} Roberto Alomar's, these numbers have not been retired. During <b>the</b> 2013 <b>All-Star</b> <b>Break,</b> <b>the</b> Level of Excellence was redesigned for the addition of Carlos Delgado's name. The redesign removed all uniform numbers from the Level of Excellence aside from Roberto Alomar's retired #12 and Tom Cheek's 4306 for his consecutive games called streak.|$|R

The home run was also his 500th career hit.|$|E
5|$|The {{coach for}} the Eastern Conference team was Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown. This {{was the first time}} Brown was {{selected}} to be an All-Star coach. He became only the second Cavaliers coach to lead an All-Star team, after Lenny Wilkens in 1989. The Cavaliers entered <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> with 40–11 record, the second best winning percentage in the Eastern Conference, behind Doc Rivers' Boston Celtics.|$|E
5|$|The {{coach for}} the Western Conference team was Los Angeles Lakers head coach Phil Jackson.

5|$|Pineda was {{selected}} to the All-Star Game on July 10 {{as a replacement for}} Justin Verlander, who was ineligible to pitch in the All-Star Game due to having pitched the day before <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break.</b> He was 8–6 at that point, but with a 3.03 ERA and 113 strikeouts in 113 innings, against only 36 walks.

5|$|The Penguins {{benefited from}} the success of several players who were called up from the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Forward Tyler Kennedy was first {{recalled}} on October 27. Defenseman Kris Letang was recalled on November 13 and immediately contributed to the Penguins shootout, scoring on all of his first five attempts, including during the Winter Classic on January 1.

5|$|The {{competitiveness}} {{of the teams}} continued the following year. Co-captains Ron Guidry and Willie Randolph had led the Yankees to first place two weeks after <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> started. On July 28, the Yankees fell out of first place, and the Red Sox won their second division title in three years. Boston went on to face the Oakland Athletics in the 1988 American League Championship Series, but would end up getting swept.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break.</b> Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E

5|$|Oates {{signed a}} four-year, $3 million {{contract}} extension with the Blues {{prior to the}} 1991–92 NHL season, but after the team signed Brendan Shanahan, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter to significant deals, felt he was underpaid. After playing in his second career All-Star Game, he threatened to walk off the team following <b>the</b> <b>all-star</b> <b>break</b> if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a negative reaction from St. Louis fans who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team dealt him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 2014, Bosh re-signed {{with the}} Heat after LeBron James {{announced}} he was leaving Miami {{to return to the}} Cleveland Cavaliers. After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf.

2500|$|During <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> game (<b>the</b> {{only time}} in his 19-year career that he played in Kansas City), Jones hit a single into right field at his first (and only) at bat during the game, and the National League won 8–0.

5|$|The team rebounded {{from the}} loss, as backup goaltender Henrik Karlsson led the Flames to a 7–4 {{victory over the}} Dallas Stars on January 21. Kiprusoff then showed a return to form by making 41 saves to lead the Flames to a 4–3 shootout win over Vancouver the {{following}} night. Victories over the Nashville Predators and St. Louis Blues allowed the Flames to enter <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> on a four-game winning streak. Posting a 10–3–3 record in the 16 games {{leading up to the}} break, the Flames had pulled themselves to within two points of the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, and stood six points shy of fourth in the conference.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> in February 2011, the Rockets were 26-31.

The team still finished the year with a 43-39 winning record. Head coach Rick Adelman left the Rockets right after the season.|$|E
5|$|In a move {{to bolster}} their {{starting}} rotation {{in preparation for the}} pennant race, the Phillies traded three minor league players, including second baseman Adrian Cardenas, pitcher Josh Outman, and outfielder Matthew Spencer to the Oakland Athletics for starting pitcher Joe Blanton on July 17. The move would prove necessary, as Blanton's start was the only game of their next series against the Mets that the Phillies would win; bullpen pitchers earned the victory (Chad Durbin) or suffered the loss (Ryan Madson and Romero) in each game of the series. The Phillies managed to go 75 after <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> within their own division, dropping series to the Marlins and Mets, but besting the Braves and sweeping the Nationals. Brad Lidge posted a save in six straight Phillies wins, and the team ended the month on a five-game winning streak, with a final record of 1510.|$|E
