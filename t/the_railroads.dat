5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned <b>the</b> <b>railroads,</b> was a political issue. The call for regulation of <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over <b>the</b> <b>railroads.</b>|$|E

5|$|All in all, the Soviet period saw a {{significant}} increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> and the sea coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> {{was known}} as <b>the</b> “crookedest <b>railroad</b> in <b>the</b> world”. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> {{featured}} 1073 curves up to 60 degrees. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> had 43 wooden trestles and 255 steep grades with the steepest at 5.3%.|$|R
50|$|The charter for the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad {{was granted}} on November 7, 1892. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> was {{incorporated}} in New Jersey in 1899. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> obtained a New Jersey charter on May 8, 1901. <b>The</b> <b>railroad's</b> power, generating station, sub-stations, and transmission lines {{were designed by}} the General Electric Company. In 1921, the Pennsylvania Power and Light company started {{to do the job}} of powering <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> instead, as part of an attempt for <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> to reduce its expenses. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> stopped bringing in profit in the middle of <b>the</b> 1920s. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> company defaulted its bonds in 1929. Henry S. Drikard, a businessman from Philadelphia, bought the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton railroad company for $165,000 in February 1930. Briefly in 1932, several railbusses were used on <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> Power to <b>the</b> rail line was removed on October 3, 1933, after a final attempt to save <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> from bankruptcy.

Although passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing intermodal freight transport with <b>the</b> <b>railroads.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{attorney}} general, White {{was in charge of}} several important lawsuits, among the most prominent being the state's pursuit of tax liabilities from railroad companies. Prior to his election as attorney general, railroads had never paid taxes in the state of West Virginia. White instituted proceedings to tax all <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> within the state. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company obtained an injunction against the levying of the taxes, leading to a judicial test case. White argued the case first in the lower courts, and then before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which ruled in White's favor. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the ruling of the state supreme court, which compelled <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> to pay taxes to the state.|$|E
5|$|Faced with {{decreasing}} passenger {{numbers and}} intense {{political pressure to}} consolidate, <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> operating into Grand Central Station re-routed their trains into other Chicago terminals, beginning with the Soo Line into Central Station in 1963. The remaining six Baltimore and Ohio and ex-Pere Marquette trains last used Grand Central Station on November 8, 1969 and were routed into their new terminus at the Chicago and North Western Terminal the following day.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> was {{originally}} incorporated as the Baltimore & Sparrows Point Railroad Company. Bethlehem Steel took over <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> in <b>the</b> early 20th century. In 1916, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> was renamed <b>the</b> Patapsco and Back Rivers <b>Railroad.</b> <b>The</b> PBR operated until 2012 when the steel mill closed down; however, in 2014 {{the remainder of}} <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> was bought by Sparrows Point Terminal (SPT) and named <b>The</b> Baltimore Industrial <b>Railroad.</b> In January 2016 <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> was renamed Tradepoint Rail, {{a part of the}} Tradepoint Atlantic family of companies.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> {{primarily}} used [...] "Ten Wheeler" [...] 4-6-0 and Consolidation (2-8-0) type locomotives, primarily {{manufactured by}} Brooks and Baldwin Locomotive Works. <b>The</b> <b>railroad's</b> first four locomotives were purchased in used condition. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> would later purchase 12 additional new locomotives.

5000|$|The {{original}} V&O {{was built}} in 1962 and was set in <b>the</b> 1950s. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> operated from Afton, VA to Elm Grove, VA. In the mid 1970s, Allen McClelland began a second phase of construction that expanded <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> from Elm Grove to Kingswood Junction, VA. McClelland {{was very interested in}} actual prototype running so <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> constantly moved forward in time. For example, in 1980 (1958 on <b>the</b> <b>railroad),</b> <b>the</b> V&O ran the last of its steam locomotives and switched entirely to diesel.

5|$|From Pusan a good {{railroad}} system {{built by}} the Japanese and well ballasted with crushed rock and river gravel extended northward. Subordinate rail lines ran westward along the south coast through Masan and Chinju and northeast near the east coast to P'ohang-dong. There the eastern line turned inland through the east-central Taebaek Mountains area. <b>The</b> <b>railroads</b> were {{the backbone of the}} UN transportation system in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>railroads,</b> the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|Railroad {{connections}} with the southwest and Texas were improved during the 1870s, {{with the formation of}} the Cotton Belt Railroad. In addition to connecting St. Louis with the West, <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> began to demand {{connections with}} the east across the Mississippi. Between 1867 and 1874, work on the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi continued despite setbacks such as caisson disease. The bridge formally opened on July 4, 1874.|$|E
50|$|On May 29, 1896 {{and again}} on July 12, 1899 <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> was placed into receivership. After 1900 <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> ceased to operate. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> was sold at {{foreclosure}} on November 29, 1902.|$|R
2500|$|In 1879, F. Jay met Charles S. Fee, {{the private}} {{secretary}} to <b>the</b> <b>railroad's</b> General Manager, H.E. Sargent. In 1883, Fee became <b>the</b> <b>railroad's</b> general passenger and ticket agent responsible for marketing <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> [...] It was a position Fee held until 1904. Fee became F.

50|$|A {{man named}} Samuel Coe {{convinced}} Cutler to build <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> on his large property for free, {{in exchange for}} a favor. <b>The</b> <b>railroad</b> would be routed through Coe's land in order to haul coal and clay off of his property. This move saved <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> a great deal by reducing <b>the</b> distance <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> traveled to Cincinnati.|$|R
5|$|Seoul {{was also}} {{the focal point of}} Korea's highway network. It also had several crucial {{connection}} points to the Soviet Union and China, but it was not designed for military traffic and the weather conditions made travel on the roads difficult. Overall the roads into Korea provided only 48 percent of the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>railroads.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{spent much}} of 1907 {{investigating}} <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> and other companies owned by Edward H. Harriman, holding hearings across the country. In October, Lane determined that the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of Harriman's lines, was engaged in rebating, a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act.|$|E
5|$|The new {{commissioner}} {{spent the}} second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country. The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over <b>the</b> <b>railroads,</b> and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but {{to strike a balance between}} the desires of railroads and those of shippers.|$|E

5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from New London for the unusually low price of $15,000, with the understanding that <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> would build a structure more suitable for the bustling city.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> from Boston to Lowell, Worcester, and Providence were {{chartered}} in 1830 and 1831, railroads {{to other}} surrounding cities including Newburyport and Portsmouth were proposed. The Eastern Railroad was chartered on April 14, 1836. Work began at East Boston in late 1836; it reached Lynn {{in the spring}} of 1837, but construction was slowed by the Panic of 1837 and did not reach Salem until 1838. Service from Salem to East Boston began on August 27, 1838, with fares half that of competing stagecoaches.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of <b>the</b> <b>railroads,</b> a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E

25|$|At the {{intersection}} with Elma Hicklin Road, the road stops paralleling <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> and continues northeast into Mason County. In Stimson, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> starts to parallel the highway, but after that, <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> curves back, and stops paralleling SR108. North of Forbes, the highway crosses <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> and then enters Kamilche, {{where the road}} ends at an interchange with US101.|$|R
5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about <b>the</b> <b>railroads</b> to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
