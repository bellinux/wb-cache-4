500|$|While {{living in}} England Donen became {{a fan of}} the British variety show Beyond the Fringe and wanted to work with the show's comedy duo Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The {{resulting}} film was Bedazzled, an updated version of the Faust legend in 1967. It was written by Cook with music by Moore, and also starred Eleanor Bron and Raquel Welch. Moore plays a lonely young man whose unrequited love of his co-worker (Bron) drives him to attempt suicide. Just then the devil (Cook) appears and offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. The film's fun-loving association with the Swinging London of the 1960s divided critics, but Roger Ebert called its satire [...] "barbed and contemporary... dry and understated", and overall, a [...] "magnificently photographed, intelligent, very funny film." [...] On the other hand, Time magazine called it the feeblest of all known variations on the Faust theme. The film was a hit and was especially popular among American college students. Donen considered it a favorite among his own films and called it [...] "a very personal film in that I said a great deal about what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in life." [...] It was remade as Bedazzled by director Harold Ramis in 2000.|$|E
500|$|Robyn was {{involved}} in the writing process for the entirety of My Truth, co-writing all fourteen tracks. She teamed up with Swedish rapper Petter for a Swedish-language duet titled [...] "Det gör ont ibland". The collaboration came about when the two were at a friend's country house. Petter said the song came together quickly, despite their different musical styles. The track was produced by rapper Thomas Rusiak with additional production by Robyn, Lindström and Ekhé. She recorded another duet for the album, titled [...] "Healthy Love", with singer Cindy Heinold. In the fall of 1998, Robyn had an abortion, which she revealed to the public months later in an issue of Café Magazine. Following the abortion, she penned the songs [...] "88 Days" [...] and [...] "Giving You Back", to help her cope with the incident. At the time of the album's completion, she deemed the latter among the best songs she had written thus far. She began using songwriting as a coping mechanism during production of Robyn Is Here when she wrote [...] "In My Heart" [...] about her parents' divorce. She wanted My Truth to be positive in spirit, but acknowledged there is [...] "some sadness expressed".

40|$|By 2007, {{one half}} of higher {{education}} {{students are expected to}} enroll in distributed learning courses. Higher education institutions need to attract students searching the Internet for courses and need to provide students with enough information to select courses. Internet resource discovery tools are readily available, however, users have difficulty selecting relevant resources. In part {{this is due to the}} lack of a standard for representation of Internet resources. An emerging solution is metadata. In the educational domain, the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee (LTSC) has specified a Learning Object Metadata (LOM) standard. This exploratory study (a) determined criteria students <b>think</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> for selecting higher education courses, (b) discovered relationships between these criteria and students' demographic characteristics, educational status, and Internet experience, and (c) evaluated these criteria vis-à-vis the IEEE LTSC LOM standard. Web-based questionnaires (N= 209) measured (a) the criteria students <b>think</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> in the selection of higher education courses and (b) three factors that might influence students' selections. Respondents were principally female (66 %), employed full time (57 %), and located in the U. S. (89 %). The chi square goodness-of-fit test determined 40 criteria students <b>think</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> and exploratory factor analysis determined five common factors among the top 21 criteria, three evaluative factors and two descriptive. Results indicated evaluation criteria <b>are</b> very <b>important</b> in course selection. Spearman correlation coefficients and chi-square tests of independence determined the relationships between the importance of selection criteria and demographic characteristics, educational status, and Internet experience. Four profiles emerged representing groups of students with unique concerns. Side by side analysis determined if the IEEE LTSC LOM standard included the criteria of importance to students. The IEEE LOM by itself is not enough to meet students course selection needs. Recommendations include development of a metadata standard for course evaluation and accommodation of group differences in information retrieval systems...|$|R

50|$|Soul Hunters are a {{humanoid}} race. They are {{not really}} interested of the matters of other races until {{someone is going to}} die that they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>important.</b> They can sense when a life form is going to die and if they choose to, can capture its soul at the moment of death in a transparent sphere using their equipment. This is only done to the most valuable souls such as leaders, thinkers, poets, dreamers, and blessed lunatics. They have also been revealed {{to be able to take}} several souls simultaneously, or even whole worlds. The spheres are then put in places where they are respected and worshipped. All Soul Hunters also carry with them at least some part of their own collection of souls. They usually travel alone and only gather into large groups when they anticipate large numbers of deaths. They see themselves as preservers, and believe that when a person dies his soul is lost and all the person's knowledge and greatness is lost along with it. Soul Hunters can extract souls from living people, but this goes against their own rules that state they may only take souls from those who are about to die. It is not known how other species interact with them, but the Minbari have stopped several of them from taking Minbari souls as it goes against their own beliefs.|$|E

5000|$|One {{goal of the}} The Witness was to {{demonstrate}} video games as an art form, [...] "exploring the different flavors of non-verbal communication that games can have, which I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to understanding games as a medium", according to Blow. The game's name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that got him into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct {{was the nature of}} [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] "cut down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, in 2007, New York Times {{columnist}} Nicholas Kristoff {{and others}} popularized {{the notion that}} [...] "hard-liners in the Bush administration killed discussion" [...] of an Iranian [...] "Grand Bargain" [...] that [...] "could have saved lives in Iraq, isolated Palestinian terrorists and encouraged civil society groups in Iran," [...] with Kristoff concluding: [...] "The record indicates that officials from the repressive, duplicitous government of Iran pursued peace more energetically and diplomatically than senior Bush administration officials—which makes me ache for my country." [...] Kristoff claimed [...] "Iran also sent its own master text of the proposal to the State Department and, through an intermediary, to the White House." [...] However, available evidence casts doubt on the genuineness of this proposal, which may have merely been an invention of Guldimann, who sought to promote U.S.-Iran rapprochement. For example, Michael Rubin noted that [...] "Guldimann told different people different things about the document's origin," [...] while [...] "the Swiss Foreign Ministry refused to back up Guldimann's account." [...] Iranian and U.S. officials {{were engaged in a}} series of secret, high-level negotiations during 2003, and Iran's UN ambassador Mohammad Javad Zarif had met with U.S. diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad on May 3—one day prior to the State Department receiving the alleged [...] "Grand Bargain." [...] Glenn Kessler asked [...] "If Iran was serious, why would such an important diplomatic undertaking be transmitted in such a haphazard way through the Swiss ambassador when one of the supposed co-authors was already holding senior-level talks with U.S. officials?" [...] Similarly, Rubin declared: [...] "Guldimann's ignorance of these ongoing discussions exposed his fraud." [...] Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage recounted that U.S. officials [...] "couldn't determine what was the Iranians' and what was the Swiss ambassador's" [...] and [...] "nothing that we were seeing in this fax was in consonance with what we were hearing face to face," [...] former National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley called the [...] "Grand Bargain" [...] "the result of freelancing by a Swiss diplomat hoping {{to be the one to}} make peace between Iran and the United States," [...] and a State Department spokesman described the document as [...] "a creative exercise on the part of the Swiss ambassador." [...] In a March 30, 2006 email to Trita Parsi, Zarif confessed: [...] "The claims and counter claims about the source of the proposals and motivations of intermediaries remain a mystery for me.
