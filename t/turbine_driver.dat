The designer's role is enhanced from merely interpreting the optimization result to explicitly controlling both material composition and geometry according to the acquired experience (material property constraints).

As part of a major debottlenecking project, they were rerated to provide more flow. The entire pump inner case assemblies (including rotor and inner casing) were replaced with higher capacity elements. The steam turbines had new governor valves and nozzle rings installed to produce more power. The control scheme was modernized with an electronic governor that adjusted the pump speed to maintain a constant header pressure. The new equipment was installed in September 1994, nothing went well. The pump experienced high blade pass frequency vibrations. The solution required unique hydraulic modifications and inboard bearing bracket stiffening to eliminate a resonance. The turbines tripped mysteriously and broke governor valve stems. The cause was a valve resonance problem that were teething problems with the electronic governor control system that took time to sort out. These problems became very high profile when the newly rerated boiler feedwater pumps tripped and caused a total plant shutdown resulting in a 14 hr flare.

For new LNG developments in arctic areas there are several features that differ them from plants operating further south. In this work a ConocoPhillips Optimized Cascade LNG process model has been established in HYSYS&# 174; and evaluated. The evaluation focus on the driver configuration and cooling method used in order to optimize process efficiency and capacity of the plant for operation in cold climate. Simulations with air cooling and water cooling have been done. Each cooling method has been evaluated for an aero derivative gas turbine compressor driver, an industrial heavy duty gas turbine compressor driver, and an electric compressor driver configuration. Yearly temperature statistics from Kola has been used. The air cooled simulations have a design temperature of 20 &# 176;C and the water cooled simulations have a design temperature of 4 &# 176;C seawater temperature and an air temperature of 5 &# 176;C. The air cooled cases are not close to design operation the entire year. The aero derivative driver configuration will have problems operating at high air temperatures and a higher design temperature is needed. The heavy duty gas <b>turbine</b> <b>driver</b> configurations have limitation in speed variation and this leads to low process efficiency at low temperatures. The electrical driver configuration will not have problems operating. The results show that air cooling is not the desired cooling method because of lower production variation and lower process efficiency. The water cooled cases are close to design conditions the entire year; hence it has the highest flexibility when it comes to production variation and highest process efficiency. The aero derivative driver configuration varies most throughout the year with lowest production in the summer. The heavy duty gas <b>turbine</b> <b>driver</b> configuration has a lower variation in production. The power delivered to the electrical motors will not be affected by air temperature which lead to high process efficiency and stable production plateau throughout the year. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of land-based gas turbines {{are known to}} be greatly affected by ambient and operating conditions including inevitable machine deterioration. This study makes a selection of gas turbines for use as compressor station drivers on two natural gas pipelines in Nigeria taking into account the local site conditions of ambient temperature and altitude as well as some level of turbine deterioration. The analysis involved modelling and simulating the on-site performance of five gas turbine engines within the power requirement range of the compressor stations as dictated by pipeline gas flow studies. The overall effect of all considered factors was an engine thermal efficiency loss of 5. 3 % and a 26. 3 % decrement in power output. Selected turbines for driving the compressor stations must therefore have a minimum of 26. 3 % more power output than the value established by pipeline flow analyses. More generally, the results suggest that gas pipelines of 24 -in. diameter with a throughput of 450 MMSCFD require a compression power of about 0. 04  MW/km if flow pressure is to be maintained at a minimum of 50  bar.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} {{process cooling}} is an energy demanding part in many chemical production processes. Cooling systems operating {{at very low}} temperatures consume {{a large amount of}} high quality energy such as electricity or high pressure steam, used to drive refrigeration compressor units. Hence decreasing refrigeration load can make a major improvement on the process energy balance. In industrial process clusters with several processes operating at low temperatures, it is important to investigate opportunities for exchange of low-temperature energy between processes. This paper presents an investigation for a chemical cluster located in Stenungsund on the West Coast of Sweden. One chemical plant within the cluster operates two compression refrigeration systems at its steam cracker plant. One system is a propylene-based system with three temperature levels between 9 °C and - 40 °C, driven by high pressure steam <b>turbine</b> <b>drivers</b> with a capacity of ca. 22 MW. The other is an ethylene refrigeration system with three temperature levels between - 62 °C and - 100 °C, electrically driven with a capacity of ca. 4. 5 MW. A previous Total Site Analysis (TSA) study of the cluster focused on integration opportunities within the cluster above ambient temperature, thereby decreasing the overall hot utility and cooling water and air demand. Utility savings below ambient temperature were not investigated in detail. This paper demonstrates how Heat Integration (HI) tools such as TSA and exergy analysis can be applied to target for shaft work and hot utility savings for processes and utility systems operating below ambient temperature. In total a savings potential corresponding to 15 % of the total shaft work consumption of the refrigeration systems was identified. In addition ca. 6. 3 MW of utility steam which is currently used for sub-ambient process heating can be saved in addition to shaft work savings...|$|R
40|$|High thermal {{efficiency}} of LNG liquefaction plants is of importance {{in order to}} minimize feed usage and to reduce CO 2 emissions. The need for high efficiency becomes important in gas constrained situations where savings in fuel auto consumption of the plant for liquefaction chilling and power generation can be converted into LNG production and also from the standpoint of CO 2 reduction. This paper will provide a comprehensive overview of waste heat recovery approaches in LNG Liquefaction facilities as a measure to boost {{thermal efficiency}} and reduce fuel auto-consumption. The paper will cover types of heating media, the need and use of heat for process applications, the use of hot oil, steam and water for process applications and direct recovery of waste heat. Cogeneration and combined cycle approaches for LNG liquefaction will also be presented along with thermal designs. Parametric studies and cycle studies relating to waste heat recovery from gas turbines used in LNG liquefaction plants will be provided. The economic viability of waste heat recovery {{and the extent to which}} heat integration is deployed will depend on the magnitude of the accrual of operating cost savings, and their ability to counteract the initial capital outlay. Savings can be in the form of reduced fuel gas costs and reduced carbon dioxide taxes. Ultimately the impact of these savings will depend on the owner’s measurement of the value of fuel gas; whether fuel usage is accounted for as lost feed or lost product. The negative impacts include the reduction in nitrogen rejection that occurs with reduced fuel gas usage and the power restrictions imposed on gas <b>turbine</b> <b>drivers</b> due to the increased exhaust system back-pressure caused by the presence of the WHRU. When steam systems are acceptable, a cogeneration type liquefaction facility can be attractive.

40|$|This study evaluates {{different}} {{solutions for}} a LNG facility, partially placed on shore and partially {{placed on a}} floater, hereby referred to as at-shore FLNG. There are several advantages with this solution where reduced cost, shorter development time and potential for standardization is highlighted as the greatest. To illustrate the challenges for an at-shore FLNG project, two main scenarios linked to a potential location for LNG production have been identified. The chosen locations are the Gulf of Mexico and Northern Norway. An initial configuration for liquefaction, refrigerant compressor driver, NGL extraction, heat generation and cooling has been established based on weather data, governmental restrictions and local conditions at the locations. The result of this configuration has been calculated using HYSYS and reference data. Next, the process or utility systems have been swapped with other configuration alternatives. This is done one alternative at the time, and {{the result has been}} measured against the initial result to identify and quantify the consequence of other process or utility systems. The desired production rate is approximately 4 MTPA, but this varies at the different configuration alternatives. Additionally, all configurations are simulated with average and high temperature to identify and quantify the consequences this have for the plant efficiency and capacity. Next, three subcases, each linked to other potential locations for LNG production, has been identified to evaluate the consequences of combining more than one alternative at the time. The alternative system combination is considered the most likely combination at the given location. The potential locations for the subcases are the west coast of Canada, the Northwest coast of Russia and the Northwest coast of Australia. As for the scenarios, the subcases are simulated with average and high temperature. Complete process models of the different scenarios and subcases have been made in HYSYS and the simulation results forms the main basis for comparison for the different configuration alternatives. The PRICO and Niche liquefaction process have been optimized with the optimization function Hyprotech SQP in HYSYS. The reason for using the optimizer is to achieve a good basis of comparison between the different process configurations and utility systems. The optimizer is configured to obtain a liquefaction process as efficient as possible based on the available compressor power different scenarios and subcases, which in this case means a specific power as low as possible. Based on the simulation results for power demand and heating duties, fuel gas consumption and CO 2 emissions are calculated for the different scenarios. The simulation and optimization results for the liquefaction processes show that PRICO has both higher production rate and lower specific power than Niche. Next, the simulation results clearly underline the superiority of seawater cooling combined with electrical drive compared to gas turbines and any air based cooling system in terms of specific power, production stability and CO 2 -emmissions. The combination of a warm climate, air cooling and gas turbine driven compressors proves to be the least efficient combination. The results imply that specific power increase with increasing cooling water temperature, thus the production rate decrease. If gas <b>turbine</b> compressor <b>drivers</b> are used, the power output drops with increasing air temperature, thus reducing the production even further. In addition to the simulations, issues that cannot be quantified by HYSYS have been addressed. This mainly regards the complexity each system entails and the reliability of the alternatives. The reliability evaluation focuses mostly on the liquefaction trains and NGL extraction as these are regarded to have the greatest impact on the overall plant reliability. As expected, electrical drive results in more operating days with 100 % production when compared to gas turbine drive. However, each train operates independently of each other, meaning that if one driver fails, the rest of the liquefaction trains can still maintain their production. This indicates that the increased reliability of electrical drive has a smaller impact on the multiple liquefaction trains in this study than it would in a single DMR train where the drivers are configured in series. It has also been a great focus on the potential for standardization of systems placed on the FLSO, regardless of feed gas composition, local conditions and climate. The study shows that the liquefaction process, storage tanks, offloading and flare system can be standardized to a certain point and placed on the FLSO. However, the production capacity and efficiency of the facility largely depends on the type of driver and available cooling water temperature. Whereas electrical motor has a constant power output despite temperature, gas turbine performance drops rapidly when the ambient temperature increase. This results in large variation in the gas turbine output at the evaluated locations, which further results in large variation in LNG production. These variations also indicate that the plant will be more challenging in operation and may be hard to operate at the optimal specifications. The results imply that to fully exploit the potential for high and efficient production, part of the process systems should be selected after the location and feed gas composition is known. This mainly regards driver, cooling and gas processing systems required upstream of the liquefaction process. A general solution is proposed, where the deck of the FLSO may have a standardized section and a field specific section that can be fitted to the given location and feed gas composition. Next, the results show that relocation of the floater is possible but not favourable, especially if the variations in ambient air temperature and feed gas composition are large. If gas <b>turbine</b> compressor <b>drivers</b> are used, they will be either be undersized or oversized depending on whether the floater is moved from cold to hot climate or opposite. Based on this, electrical compressor drive combined with a seawater based cooling system is regarded to be the only favourable option for relocation without a major loss in production or efficiency. This configuration is also the only one regarded to be favourable for standardization before location and feed gas composition are known. However, this is also the most expensive configuration, especially if power must be generated locally, but a detailed cost analysis for the different alternatives has not been performed in this study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the emissions module of what {{is part of a}} wider project dealing with various aspects of gas <b>turbine</b> usage as <b>drivers</b> for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) production. The framework is known as TERA, a Techno-Economic and Environmental Risk Analysis, developed at Cranfield University with the core of the study being the performance module whilst the risk, economics and environmental modules are built around the performance. Whilst TERA exists for aviation and power production no such system is available for assessment of LNG production. With environmental issues high on the public agenda new legislation on emissions can be expected, especially in Europe. This will mean Oil & Gas companies will have {{to look for ways to}} reduce their emissions. One way to reduce turbo machinery losses is to replace out dated and/or obsolete machinery having less overall energy efficiency. The selection of turbomachinery involves assessments of risk, both economic and technical, as well as environmental impacts of the new technology. The core to all of this is the performance assessment, the primary basis on which selection is made. An aviation emissions model, developed at Cranfield University, is adapted for industrial applications. Technical performance calculations are made using the inhouse software called Turbomatch. Performance results for three typical days of the year (summer, winter and spring/autumn) are fed into the emissions model to get the levels of NOx, CO 2, H 2 O, CO and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. Later, NOx, CO 2 and H 2 O emissions levels are fed into the environmental module to estimate the damage the engine causes to the environment over 100 years with respect to global warming. Two hypothetical engine configurations are investigated based on engine data available in the public domain. The first one, an 85 MW single spool industrial machine (SSI- 85), is used as the baseline to compare against a 100 MW triple spool, intercooled aeroderivative (ITSA- 100). The results suggest that the ITSA- 100 produces more NOx but has less carbon emissions and consequently less global warming effects. This has varied economic impacts depending on which emission is a priority for reduction. CO 2 and H 2 O emissions are more important than NOx for LNG gas turbine applications. The paper shows how this simple but effective system can be utilised to give a viable comparison between one or more proposed solutions for turbomachinery selection and replacement. The scope of the system is expanded as other modules come together to give a total assessment in terms of technical, economic, environmental and risk perspectives for LNG production...|$|R

A second decision has to be made between a high speed direct driven train and a low speed driver (gas turbine or motor) driving the compressor via a speed increasing gear. Finally it has to be decided whether a classical, oil lubricated train arrangement shall be used or if a high speed, oil-free, magnetic bearing levitated train configuration shall be chosen. With these three major decisions a variety of different train configurations are possible. They differ from each other in many technical aspects and therefore have strengths and weaknesses which can be rated in order to facilitate the evaluation of the optimum equipment configuration for a certain application. This paper specifically concentrates on the comparison of rotordynamic key figures like the logarithmic decrement (damping) of the lowest bending mode, the presence of overhung coupling modes within the speed range or the presence of torsional critical speeds which can be excited within the speed range and which therefore might adversely affect the integrity of the train components. The evaluated configurations include modern hermetically sealed, oil-free, magnetic bearing levitated compressor designs. Based on these key figures this paper will benchmark the rotordynamic robustness as well as the operational safety of the investigated train configurations...|$|E
40|$|PaperPg. 15 - 22. The profitability, {{reliability}} {{and maintenance of}} gas turbine driven centrifugal compressor units are not inherent with the machinery, {{but for the most}} part, depend on the piping system to which they are connected and the careful testing, installation, and initial operation of the units. Contractors are responsible for the proper interfacing of the compressors with the associated process conditions, foundation, piping, electrical and control systems. The gas <b>turbine</b> <b>driver</b> merely maintains the rotating speed of the compressor in a predetermined manner. Usually, the rotating equipment system is custom designed for a unique application and this precludes any so called standard procedures. Each system must be carefully reviewed prior to selecting the design point of the compressor to provide flexibility of operation and include allowance for off design performance. This, before the fact decision, is a source of many controversies because few process designers really appreciated that when the design point of the compressor system is established, the machinery then becomes the constraint on how the process will operate. The critical design problems then center on how to operate the process without damaging the rotating equipment. There is a lot of discussion on how to align rotating equipment. We place great emphasis on how the equipment is aligned the first time. Our belief is that the equipment should be more out of alignment the first time it is placed in operation than at any other time. The basic reason for alignment is that thermal gradients change during the loading of the system. We realize that this first alignment is a judgement and request that all concerned approve the procedures.

This unit is coupled to a three stage, poster-type, centrifugal air compressor with two high speed pinion shafts engaging a common bull gear. The turbine drives the lower speed pinion at a maximum speed of 10, 500 rpm. Located {{at the other end}} of this same pinion is the first stage impeller wheel. The second and third stages are mounted on the higher speed pinion, rotating at a maximum speed of 13, 600 rpm. The maximum speed of the bull gear is 1, 940 rpm. All the existing compressor bearings are the four-lobe type. The original turbine rotor consists of three stages and has a 41. 34 inch bearing span. The bearings are lemon-bore type with journal diameters of 3. 0 and 4. 0 inches on the inlet and exhaust ends, respectively. This turbine has exhibited subsynchronous vibration, at approximately half rotational speed, during field testing. The half frequency vibration prevented operation above 9, 400 rpm because a shaft resonance was excited and vibration levels became prohibitively high. The analysis of the existing rotor-bearing system predicts that the turbine operates close to the second critical speed and that the rotor is stable under normal load conditions. However, the rotor becomes unstable when the lemon-bore bearings are unloaded. There are two major sources of bearing load in addition to gravity. These loads are misalignment and gear mesh loading. Misalignment can result from differential thermal growth of the turbine and compressor cases and supports. If the coupling does not act as an ideal joint, this differential growth can impose external loads at the bearings. The bearing load resulting from the gear mesh is a reaction to the torque transmission at the gear interface. For example, the <b>turbine</b> <b>driver</b> rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the low speed pinion gear tends to climb up the bull gear, which causes an upward external load on the pinion bearings. As in the case of misalignment, if the coupling is not ideal, the turbine bearings can also be affected by these gear mesh reaction loads. This analysis is primarily concerned with the effect of these external loads that oppose gravity and cause degrees of net bearing unloading because the unloading causes rotor instability. The rotor is unstable with 75 pounds unloading at each bearing or 110 pounds unloading at the exhaust end bearing alone (with a normal gravity load at the inlet end bearing). As a solution to the problem, a new set of bearings was designed to stabilize the rotor and move the peak response speeds away from the operating speed range. The new bearings are five-shoe-tilt-pad bearings with load-between-pad orientation. The inlet end bearing has a 3. 0 inch diameter bore with length-to-diameter ratio of 1. 0; and preload of 0. 8. The exhaust end bearing has a 3. 995 inch diameter bore with a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 4 and preload of 0. 0. With the new tilt-pad bearing design there are no response peaks in the normal operating speed range and the system log decrement is 2. 8 times higher than with the existing system, under normal load conditions. The log decrement for the tilt-pad bearings is + 0. 52 for an unloading of 100 pounds. Therefore, the tilt-pads provide a stable rotor support that is not sensitive to unloading...|$|E
