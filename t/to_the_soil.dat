Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E
5|$|The flowers hold profuse {{amounts of}} nectar and are pollinated by honeyeaters. Although L.formosa is {{uncommon}} in cultivation, it is straightforward {{to grow in}} soils with good drainage and a partly shaded to sunny aspect. It is readily propagated by seed.

5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which are applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla {{is grown}} on small patches of land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier {{windward}} side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the flowering period is from July to August.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|High winds caused damage across Guam, {{mostly to}} roofs and to poorly built or wooden structures. A total of 1,996houses were {{severely}} damaged or destroyed. Better constructed homes fared well during the storm, {{and there was}} little window damage. The winds also downed power lines, leaving an island-wide power outage. John F. Kennedy High School sustained damage to its football field and library. The most significant effects were from the heavy rainfall, resulting in landslides in some areas and causing rivers to flow at above-normal rates; 14stations reported either record flow rates or peak crests, including an island-wide peak crest of 8.55m (28.06ft) {{at the mouth of}} the Tolaeyuus River. Two water gauges were destroyed during the storm. Swollen rivers damaged roads, washed away trees, and caused erosion. The storm flooding contaminated Fena Lake, which provides water to the military base, for a few days. In addition, 34 of the island's 110water wells failed due to the storm. Flooding also destroyed a building and damaged the runway at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, and damaged a bridge near Inarajan. A few palm trees fell due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> being loosened, either from heavy rains or high waves. Some of the downed trees struck cars, but the winds were not strong enough to overturn any vehicles. In the higher elevations of Guam, some areas experienced heavy crop damage due to strong winds; however, crop damage in general was less than expected, estimated at around $500,000. In Apra Harbor, high seas washed ashore or sank five boats, and a Navy barge spilled 397,000litres (105,000gallons) of oil. Overall, Chataan caused about $60million in property damage on Guam, and there were 23injuries, none of them serious.|$|E

25|$|A major {{component}} of soil respiration is from the decomposition of litter which releases CO2 to the environment while simultaneously immobilizing or mineralizing nutrients. During decomposition, nutrients, such as nitrogen, are immobilized by microbes for their own growth. As these microbes are ingested or die, nitrogen is added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Nitrogen is also mineralized from the degradation of proteins and nucleic acids in litter. This mineralized nitrogen is also added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Due to these processes, the rate of nitrogen added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> is coupled with rates of microbial respiration. Studies have shown that rates of soil respiration were associated with rates of microbial turnover and nitrogen mineralization. Alterations of the global cycles can further act to change the climate of the planet.|$|E

In peat-like soils the uranium will tend to bind to the humic acids, this tends to fix the uranium in the soil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> of <b>the</b> summit {{region of}} Mauna Kea are similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> of <b>the</b> high {{mountain}} deserts and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> of cold deserts. Dramatic differences, however, exist between <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> of <b>the</b> summit and other neighboring cones and <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> of <b>the</b> glaciated terrain. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> {{of some of}} the cones of the summit area are clay rich and contain phyllosilicate minerals; <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> of <b>the</b> glaciated terrain are sandy and contain X-ray amorphous clay. Montmorillonite and a Mg-rich trioctahedral mineral identified as saponite are the clay minerals of the summit. Because the summit area of Mauna Kea supported an ice cap {{at the time of the}} formation of the cones, the origin of the smectite minerals could have resulted from the alteration of the tephra by steam and water released in the melting of the ice. Hypogene fluids are, however, more likely to be responsible for the genesis of the phyllosilicate minerals...|$|R

30|$|When {{the sleeve}} is being driven, the sleeve {{transfers}} the periodic vibrating load <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> around <b>the</b> sleeve (Ekanayake et al. 2013). The strain in <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> around <b>the</b> sleeve continues <b>to</b> increase, and <b>the</b> cohesion and shear strength gradually decrease.

Therefore, the fluctuation of the internal shaft resistance is more obvious {{than that of the}} external shaft resistance. As <b>the</b> result, <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> strength and cohesion decrease under cyclic shearing action. Because of the decrease in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> strength and cohesion, <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> plug becomes partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance of sleeve is much smaller than those by other installation methods.|$|R
