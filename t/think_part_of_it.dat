Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it."

A little rocking-chair moved to and fro precisely as if some one were sitting in it, and so on. It was all unconvincing at the time, but as I look back upon it now, after years of experience, I am inclined to <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> at least was genuine. And this brings me to say to Mrs. Quigg, and to any other doubter, that you have only to step aside into silence and shadow and wait for a moment--and the bewildering will happen, or you will imagine it to happen. I will agree to furnish from this company a medium that will astonish even our materialistic friend Miller." ...|$|E

5000|$|Allen says, [...] "Opus Dei {{cannot be}} called secretive." [...] Accusations of secrecy, he says, stem from mistakenly equating its members with monks and expecting members {{to behave as}} clerics. Instead, its lay members, like any normal professional, are {{ultimately}} responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the prelature which provides them spiritual training. Opus Dei itself, he says, provides abundant information. Supporters claim Opus Dei's relative silence stems not from a secretive nature, but rather {{is the result of}} a deep commitment to privacy, humility, and [...] "avoidance of self-aggrandizement." [...] Supporters argue that Opus Dei [...] "has the obligation to respect its members' privacy" [...] They say members of Opus Dei do generally reveal their membership status to their family and closest friends. The historical opposition to Opus Dei may also have contributed to the need for privacy - [...] as one author speculates, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> too, is that, historically, because a lot of people didn't like Opus Dei, there was just a sense that it would be better not to be too upfront because you're just inviting hostility." ...|$|E

5000|$|After touring {{in support}} of their 1983 LP Another Perfect Day, guitarist Brian [...] "Robbo" [...] Robertson and drummer Phil [...] "Philthy Animal" [...] Taylor left Motörhead and {{eventually}} decided to form the band 'Operator' together.

'Cause I enjoyed playing with Robbo so much, maybe I'll get a band together with him, or something like that. I didn't really have a plan.." [...] In his memoir White Line Fever Lemmy reflects on Taylor's departure: [...] "..I hadn't been seeing much of Phil but I had been getting {{the impression that he}} wasn't really that keen any more. Although we didn't discuss his reasons for leaving the band, I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was because he wanted to become a serious musician, or whatever it is people think heavy metal isn't which, if you ask me, is total bullshit...And our troubles with Brian Robertson aside, Philthy {{was one of the biggest}} Thin Lizzy fans in existence...There we were with auditions to do that day with two guitarists who had travelled from Cheltenham and Wales. Now I didn't have a drummer! But I have to admit, Phil was a gentleman about the whole thing...He did leave decently, unlike some of Motörhead's former members.." ...|$|E

Then I did some shows with them and I toured with Sade, so I spent a decent amount of time on the road, and then I spent {{the past couple of years}} on the album. It took a little longer on this album than on previous albums, but I’m really just a year off my pace." [...] He also spoke about working with Kanye West on the album, saying: [...] "I worked with Kanye more on this album than I had before, and I <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is just us connecting and getting together to create, given how busy he is and how busy I am. Just finding time for us to work together kind of added a little bit of extra time to the process. But I think it was worth it." [...] He also spoke about how he feels this is his best album yet, saying: [...] "I feel like it’s my best album yet, and I think creatively, we did some great things. The collaboration and the talent that we have on the album is better than we’ve ever had. As far as producers, co-writers and people just helping shape the sound. I feel like Kanye’s leadership was great in helping to do that. I really feel good about it." ...|$|E

And that I expect no favour on account of my youth, business, want of health, or any such idle excuses.
