50|$|She had two masts, square-rigged and {{supported}} by a <b>trysail</b> <b>mast</b> aft of the main mast. Although fitted with seven pairs of gunports along her upper deck, she was armed with only eight four-pounder cannons with the remaining ports left unused. Twelve lightweight half-pounder swivel guns were also mounted on the deck, and her complement was 80 men.|$|E
50|$|Relief {{was laid}} down in 1835 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and {{launched}} on 14 September 1836. Designed by Samuel Humphreys, she was built along merchant vessel lines and included <b>trysail</b> <b>mast</b> and gaffsail on all three masts to enable her to work to windward in strong winds. Her hull was pierced for 16 small guns, but she usually carried only four to six 18-pounder and two 12-pounders.|$|E
50|$|Sylph was a clipper ship {{built in}} Calcutta in 1831 for the Parsi {{merchant}} Rustomjee Cowasjee. After her purchase by the Hong Kong based merchant house Jardine Matheson, in 1833 Sylph {{went on to}} set an unbroken speed record by sailing from Calcutta to Macao in 17 days, 17 hours. Her primary role was to transport opium between various ports in the Far East. Two contemporary paintings of Sylph show her {{to have been a}} heavily rigged ship with <b>trysails</b> on each <b>mast</b> and a tall, high-peaked spanker.|$|R
50|$|Swift had two square-rigged masts, {{supported}} by a third <b>trysail</b> <b>mast</b> aft of the main. She was built with seven pairs of gunports along her upper deck, but initially armed with only eight four-pounder cannons with the remaining ports left unused. Twelve lightweight half-pounder swivel guns (anti-personnel weapons) were mounted on posts {{along the sides of}} the deck, and two more four-pounder cannons were added by Admiralty Order in 1744. The vessel was established with a complement of 80 men.|$|E
5000|$|As designed, Wolfs {{dimensions}} were {{in keeping}} with other vessels of her class with an overall length of 87 ft, a beam of 25 ft and measuring 243 [...] tonnes burthen. She had two masts, square-rigged and supported by a <b>trysail</b> <b>mast</b> aft of the main mast. Two decks were fitted instead of one, reflecting the design of her predecessor, the 1731 [...] Constructed with eight pairs of gunports, she was initially supplied with fourteen four-pounder cannons in addition to twelve deck-mounted half-pounder swivel guns.|$|E
5000|$|Although superficially {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the brig or brigantine, {{the snow is}} a much older three masted design which evolved from the larger fully rigged ship. The foremast and mainmast are both squared-rigged, but the fore and aft rigged spanker sail {{is attached to a}} small <b>trysail</b> <b>mast</b> (or in modern times a steel cable) stepped directly behind the mainmast. This [...] "snow-mast" [...] allows the gaff to raised unhindered by the mainmast and higher than the main yard, which in turn also allows the snow to fly a main course without complications.|$|E
