5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E

50|$|Some {{writers have}} argued that <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Permian dissorophoid Gerobatrachus hottoni is a lissamphibian. If it is not, <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> known lissamphibians are Triadobatrachus and Czatkobatrachus from <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> Triassic.|$|R
5|$|Each poem {{has five}} {{sections}}. The later poems connect to <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> sections, with Little Gidding synthesising {{the themes of}} <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> poems within its sections. Within Eliot's own poetry, the five sections connect to The Waste Land. This allowed Eliot to structure his larger poems, which he had difficulty with.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as was done in <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost {{less than that of}} any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Soviet {{journalist}} Lev Bezymensky's book on {{the death}} of Hitler was published in the West. It included the SMERSH autopsy report, but because of <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> disinformation attempts, western historians thought it untrustworthy.|$|E
