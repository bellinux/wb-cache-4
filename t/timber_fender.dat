5000|$|The metal superstructure, plus a <b>timber</b> <b>fender</b> on {{the eastern}} side of the west draw channel and a cluster of wooden pilings at the north end of the west draw pier, were built by the Phoenix Bridge Company, which {{completed}} its work on March 1, 1901, under a $145,959.98 contract. The pavement, railings, and [...] "other appurtenances" [...] were completed May 20, by the Alcatraz Paving Company for $66,870.|$|E
40|$|CIVINSThe Navy has {{traditionally}} used treated timber materials for fender systems for piers and wharves in Pearl Harbor. In recent years, {{the costs associated}} with the use of timber have escalated and the Navy has begun to use plastic piles at installations around the world to replace <b>timber</b> <b>fender</b> systems. Plastic fender systems are more expensive, but have greater energy absorption capabilities and are more resilient to environmental decay. To determine whether plastic piles are a cost saving alternative to treated timber, the present study compiled and evaluated existing technical data, maintenance/ construction records and inspection reports from various Navy staff civil engineer offices and at the Navy Public Works Center Pearl Harbor (PWC). Since records at these various locations were not designed to present associated cost/ maintenance data in a format suitable for an economic analysis, field surveys of over 3 miles of waterfront in Pearl Harbor and interviews with staff civil engineers and wharf building branch managers at PWC were conducted to supplement existing historical data. Through the gathered data, the maintenance costs of timber pile fenders are estimated and compared to those of composite plastic piles using manufacturers' quotes and from reports compiled by the Navy Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL). For the expected life cycles of timber piles observed in Pearl Harbor this analysis shows the proposed plastic system to be more cost effective for shore facilities with remaining service lives of greater than ten years[URL]...|$|E
25|$|The tower {{pedestals}} had creosote <b>timber</b> <b>fenders,</b> {{which were}} installed in 1948 to deflect marine debris and traffic, which were removed sometime between 1995 and 2000.|$|R
5000|$|The main lift span weighs 750 ST, with {{an equal}} amount in counterweights, so the lift {{mechanism}} operates 1500 ST using two [...] electric motors, one in each tower. In the event of electrical failure, backup electrical power is provided by a [...] diesel generator set. The main lift span can be raised to its full height in less than 90 seconds, although the total operating cycle can disrupt road traffic for 8-25 minutes. Clearance under the raised lift is 135 ft to the highest anticipated water level, and the navigation channel is 270 ft wide between the <b>timber</b> <b>fenders</b> protecting the tower piers. With the lift down, vertical clearance is only 18 ft.|$|R
50|$|Major {{repairs to}} the bridge were {{conducted}} in 1950 and 1974. The <b>timber</b> <b>fenders</b> at the swing-span piers have been reconstructed several times. In 1950 the original concrete jack arch deck was replaced with a reinforced slab and the stringers were encased. In 1974 the truss lower chord was reinforced for its full length, plates were added at the bottom flanges of the end floor beams, and new stringer seat angle connections were added at the floor beams. While the original decorative metal railings were left intact on the approach spans, chain-link fences were placed along the sidewalks on the swing span. While the bridge once had a load-carrying capacity of 20 tons, it was later limited to 3 tons because of rust and corrosion.|$|R
2500|$|It is a {{fact that}} {{gigantic}} ships sometimes do not go precisely where their master wants them to. [...] Navigating thousands of tons of ship through a bridge with only a few meters to spare must indeed have been a challenge. [...] There were accidents. [...] One, documented with photographic evidence in a yahoo! discussion group [...] shows the <b>timber</b> <b>fenders</b> {{on the west side of}} the bridge crushed, obviously by an impact from a ship. [...] The swing bridge sitting right in the middle of the channel was severe hazard. [...] Anecdotes from some sailors who travelled through this bridge indicate that there was a bell located on the bridge which would ring whenever a ship made contact. [...] This would warn the crew to check for damage.|$|R
50|$|Reconstruction of the viaduct {{began in}} the summer of 1882:in the rebuilt viaduct, the three inner columns in each pier were still cast-iron, but the two outer 'rakers' were each a single wrought-iron tube filled with {{concrete}} and provided with <b>timber</b> ice <b>fenders.</b> The original raker foundation piles were retained, but cast-iron clips were bolted around them, and the annulus between clips and pile filled with cement. Although by August 1883 the viaduct reconstruction was sufficiently far advanced that construction traffic was run over it, passenger services over the line did not resume until 1 May 1884.|$|R
5000|$|Tower Bridge was {{initially}} designed with a 52 ft wide roadway with sidewalks, with single lanes for cars flanking a large 13 ft center lane for trains. The towers are 160 ft. From east to west, the bridge {{consists of a}} 30 ft long girder span, a 167 ft long eastern truss approach span, the 209 ft long central lift span, a 193 ft long western approach span and four 34 ft long girder spans. With the draw up, there is 100 ft of vertical clearance above high water with a 172 ft wide navigation channel between the <b>timber</b> pier <b>fenders.</b> Although the lift span weighs 1150 ST, {{the use of an}} equal amount of counterweights (located in each tower) means the span is operated with two relatively small [...] electric motors.|$|R
5000|$|In condemning Bouch's Southesk viaduct for {{defective}} foundations after rigorous testing, Colonel Yolland (the {{head of the}} Railway Inspectorate) {{had also}} stated his opinion that [...] "piers constructed of cast-iron columns of the dimensions used in this viaduct should not in future be sanctioned by the Board of Trade.". Marindin's report noted that [...] " [...] This disaster furnishes a very convincing proof of the unreliability of small cast-iron columns when used for the piers of viaducts in positions where {{they are likely to}} be exposed to any blow or sudden shock [...] " [...] but drew a slightly different conclusion: that [...] "it would be far better in future to avoid any such mode of construction.". Consequently, Marindin stopped well short of requiring any reconstruction of the viaduct to use only wrought-iron columns: [...] "I do not, however, consider that the reconstruction of this viaduct need be objected to provided due care is taken, either by the erection of <b>timber</b> ice <b>fenders</b> or by the substitution of wrought iron rakers of sufficient strength to withstand the blows of the floating ice, to guard the cast iron bearing columns from any such dangerâ€¦. And it is worthy of consideration whether it would not be better to increase the width of the spans at the centre of the channel, so as to permit the ice to pass more freely than it does at present." ...|$|R
