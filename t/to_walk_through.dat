5|$|Often unseen {{parts of}} the University of Leeds display {{elements}} of brutalism, with large areas of exposed concrete. From the A660 however, only older {{parts of the}} university are visible. To view these parts of the university it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the main campus.|$|E
5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They did not think much of the palace after touring it, so they decided <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|At Philadelphia Mutual Savings Bank, a {{group of}} men led by Agent Mitchell Loeb break in and use a machine that makes it {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the bank's wall. Several men pass through the wall and steal a safe deposit box numbered 610. One of the men is unable to make it back through however before the wall solidifies again, and he is left stuck inside the wall; Loeb shoots him in the head to prevent him from talking, and they leave.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E

5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through,</b> even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the first}} New Zealander to be awarded the Victoria Cross, Heaphy was an {{accomplished}} artist. His watercolours, mostly produced between 1841 and 1855, are an important record of many scenes {{in the early days}} of European settlement in New Zealand. Many of his works have been published in histories of New Zealand but his name is best known now through the Heaphy Track in the north-west corner of the South Island. He and Brunner were probably the first Europeans <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> this area of the South Island and the Heaphy Track, though he never followed its route, is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Rescue trains were {{dispatched}} {{from across}} Atlantic Canada, {{as well as}} the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3pm. The track had become impassable at Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, Kentville, Amherst and Stellarton and from the New Brunswick towns of Sackville, Moncton and Saint John.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} special cap power-ups appear {{in certain areas}} on many stages. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to {{withstand}} wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons {{can be used to}} reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{contingent}} did {{not reach}} {{in time for the}} fighting, the city's capital was taken. Aside from some farm life, the town had been largely abandoned. The taking of the region marked a continuous swath of territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper, a total of 3,000 square kilometers. In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the heavy snow at freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 unaccounted for. Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and hostage-taking.|$|E
5|$|In late 1829, with {{construction}} of the railway almost complete, the Rainhill Trials were held on a short level stretch of the completed line near Rainhill, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine which type of locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The Trials were widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6October 1829. Of the five entrants Rocket, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert, was the only entrant to complete the trial without suffering a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill Trials were a series of independent trials. Each engine ran on a different day.) At {{around the time of}} the Rainhill Trials the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed. To win over sceptical locals it was whitewashed, fitted with lighting and a band, and the public charged a shilling apiece <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
