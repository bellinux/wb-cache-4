5000|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>Charlie's</b> parents raised £1.2 million via {{crowdfunding}} {{caused some}} foreign observers to suspect {{the decision to}} withdraw Charlie's life support was driven by cost. They were mistaken: money was never the issue. The High Court judge described arguments of commentators in the United States <b>that</b> <b>Charlie's</b> plight {{was the result of}} the UK having a state-run national health service as [...] "nonsensical".|$|R

A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed <b>that</b> <b>Charlie</b> is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery.

Although horrified <b>that</b> <b>Charlie</b> and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good.

5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film {{adaptation}} and declined the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason <b>that</b> <b>Charlie</b> and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E

60|$|Obviously if I used my {{knowledge}} I should stand alone and unapproachable until all men were as wise as myself. That would be something, but manlike I was ungrateful. It seemed bitterly unfair <b>that</b> <b>Charlie's</b> memory should fail me when I needed it most.|$|R

60|$|Everybody {{began to}} speak at once. Mr. Hoopdriver twirled his moustache. He felt <b>that</b> <b>Charlie's</b> {{recognition}} of his gentlemanliness was at any rate a redeeming feature.

5|$|Steve becomes {{paranoid}} <b>that</b> <b>Charlie</b> will {{steal the}} gold, {{and starts to}} launder it faster, but he is forced to kill Yevhen when he reveals {{his knowledge of the}} Venice heist. Yevhen's death infuriates Mashkov, his cousin and a leading member of an Ukrainian crime family. Mashkov connects the murder to Charlie through Skinny Pete.

5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing <b>that</b> <b>Charlie</b> was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{after the}} {{military}} evacuates Yellowstone, Jackson watches Charlie's video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shifts, Earth crust displacement and the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar predict a 2012 phenomenon.

5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells <b>Charlie</b> <b>that</b> if <b>Charlie</b> ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. <b>Charlie</b> then realizes <b>that</b> he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell <b>Charlie</b> <b>that</b> the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves <b>that</b> <b>Charlie's</b> models are correct.|$|R
2500|$|However, Hack's {{performance}} received disappointing {{reviews from}} critics and the series lost 40 {{percent of its}} audience during her time on the series.

60|$|A {{ring and}} a sharp knock {{interrupted}} him. A few moments later Charlie Brooke was ushered into the room.

5|$|The same year, Arsenal became {{embroiled in}} a scandal; footballers' pay {{at the time was}} limited by a maximum wage, but an FA enquiry found <b>that</b> <b>Charlie</b> Buchan had {{secretly}} received illegal payments from Arsenal as an incentive to sign for the club. Sir Henry Norris was indicted for his part and banned from football, but Chapman escaped punishment, and with the autocratic Norris replaced by the more benign Samuel Hill-Wood, Chapman's power and influence within the club increased, allowing him control over all aspects of the club's business. He persevered in building the team, strengthening his attacking lineup with the signings of David Jack in 1928, and Alex James and Cliff Bastin in 1929. As at his previous clubs, Chapman worked on improving the defence, notably through the signings of Herbie Roberts and Eddie Hapgood at centre half and left back respectively.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} <b>that</b> <b>Charlie</b> has {{not been}} taking her medication, Serena and Vanessa reluctantly team up to find her.

One of Blair's old friends reveals that Blair left the party. While accompanying Chuck to their apartment to look for Blair, Nate confesses that he told Raina (Tika Sumpter) everything behind her mother's death. Chuck reprimands Nate until Raina interrupts them to apologize. Blair is held hostage by Russell in Chuck's hotel. Pretending to escape, she calls Chuck on her phone, revealing her location.

Georgina offers her aid in their scheme but Dan, Vanessa, and Serena reject her help, going their separate ways to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Charlie is {{accepted}} by Sam and Patrick's {{group of friends}} and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party Charlie trips on LSD.

At a regular Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable.

50|$|There is {{a certain}} amount of {{controversy}} surrounding the display of the skeleton. The Council of British Druid Orders (CoBDO) demanded that the skeleton be reburied where it was found, or as near as is practically possible, claiming that putting a skeleton in a museum as an attraction is disrespectful. The archaeological community fear <b>that</b> reburying <b>Charlie</b> will lead to a dangerous precedent being set. Historians have also argued <b>that</b> <b>Charlie's</b> skeleton should be kept in a museum so it is available for research. English Heritage and The National Trust held a public consultation on the future of Charlie; in April 2010 the decision was made to keep the skeleton on public view.|$|R
