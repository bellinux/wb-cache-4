5|$|Many of {{the iconic}} {{aspects of a}} typical James Bond film were {{established}} in Dr. No: the film begins with {{an introduction to the}} character through the view of a gun barrel and a highly stylised main title sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. Production designer Ken Adam established an elaborate visual style that is one of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the film series.|$|E
5|$|The film {{may have}} been {{inspired}} by the real 1909 strike of the New York City shirtwaist makers, but the strike ended without settlement. The scenario is bears <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the successful dime novels with an improbable resolution. Released on July 8, 1910, the film has received attention for presenting labor issues, but the film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} the Bond films, largely derived from {{production}} designer Ken Adam, is one of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the Bond film series, {{and the effect of}} his work on Dr. No's lair can be seen in another film he worked on, Dr. Strangelove.|$|E

5|$|Written over {{a period}} of several years and {{influenced}} by European literature, Siti Akbari differs from earlier syairs in its use of suspense and emphasis on prose rather than form. It also incorporates European realist views to expand upon the genre, although it maintains several of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> traditional syairs. Critical views have emphasised various aspects of its story, finding in the work an increased empathy for women's thoughts and feelings, a call for a unifying language in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and a polemic regarding the relation between tradition and modernity.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

5|$|The {{works are}} {{typically}} installed in listening booths with headphones, {{though they were}} also installed in the public streets of Cologne and Helsinki as a commentary on globalization. His Lagos by Bus is a recording of Lagos passengers traveling the danfo share taxis and molue minibuses characteristic {{of the city to}} work. A vendor offers a prayer before selling medication to riders, as a sociopolitical protest song by Fela Kuti plays on the radio. The 40-minute installation was exhibited at Cologne's Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum in 2010, and the booth was painted yellow with black stripes and stickers to imitate <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the danfo. An outdoor installation at the Cologne Public Library piped the streets of Lagos to those of Cologne. A similar installation took place at Helsinki's Kiasma contemporary art museum.|$|E
5|$|This {{impacted}} amphibians {{in particular}} {{in a number of}} ways. The enormous drop in sealevel due to greater quantities of the world's water being locked into glaciers profoundly affected the distribution and size of the semiaquatic ecosystems which amphibians favored, and the significant cooling of the climate further narrowed the amount of new territory favorable to amphibians. Given that among <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> amphibians are an obligatory return to a body of water to lay eggs, a delicate skin prone to desiccation (thereby often requiring the amphibian to be relatively close to water throughout its life), and a reputation of being a bellwether species for disrupted ecosystems due to the resulting low resilience to ecological change, amphibians were particularly devastated, with the Labyrinthodonts among the groups faring worst. In contrast, reptiles - whose amniotic eggs have a membrane that enables gas exchange out of water, and which thereby can be laid on land - were better adapted to the new conditions. Reptiles invaded new niches at a faster rate and began diversifying their diets, becoming herbivorous and carnivorous, rather than feeding exclusively on insects and fish. Meanwhile, the severely impacted amphibians simply could not out-compete reptiles in mastering the new ecological niches, and so were obligated to pass the tetrapod evolutionary torch to the increasingly successful and swiftly radiating reptiles.|$|E
25|$|They {{argue that}} it was in San Lorenzo and the Olmec heartland that <b>the</b> <b>{{hallmarks}}</b> <b>of</b> the Olmec culture were first established, hallmarks that include the patio/plaza concept, monumental sculpture, Olmec iconography, archetypical Olmec figurines, and other portable art.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> Persian gardens is the four-part garden {{laid out}} with axial paths that {{intersect}} at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful {{metaphor for the}} organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> China's {{socialist economy}} was its promise of {{employment}} to all able {{and willing to}} work and job-security with virtually lifelong tenure. Reformers targeted the labor market as unproductive because industries were frequently overstaffed to fulfill socialist goals and job-security reduced workers' incentive to work. This socialist policy was pejoratively called the iron rice bowl.|$|E
25|$|The SO19 {{firearms}} officers {{involved in}} the shooting were debriefed and drugs and alcohol tests were taken as a standard procedure. The officers were taken off duty pending {{an investigation into the}} shooting. One security agency source said later that members of SO19 received training from the SAS. He said the operation was not typical of the police, and bore <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> a special forces operation.|$|E

25|$|Whatever the cause, {{within a}} few hundred years of the {{abandonment}} of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on {{the western edge of}} the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400BCE, but without <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled Epi-Olmec, has features similar to those found at Izapa, some 550km (330miles) to the southeast.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> Philip Yeo {{has been}} his passion in {{developing}} people.

In return for government funding to complete their studies in university, these scholars make a commitment to return and serve the Singapore government for a period of six years.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the BMAC were sedentary people who practised irrigation farming of wheat and barley. With their impressive material culture including monumental architecture, bronze tools, ceramics, and jewellery of semiprecious stones, the complex exhibits many of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> civilisation. The complex {{can be compared to}} proto-urban settlements in the Helmand basin at Mundigak in western Afghanistan and Shahr-e Sukhteh in eastern Iran, or at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the {{scientific}} revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research. Though it is certainly not true that Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways. Many of <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{response}} to Panopticon was generally very warm; as it followed 2002's critically acclaimed Oceanic, many reviewers {{were quick to}} hold the two in comparison. The consensus was that Panopticon represented a progression, of sorts. The album's sound continued Isis' departure from the strictures of sludge and metal – which had been <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> their earlier material – and continued along the trajectory of post-metal, achieved by heightened use of melody and clean vocals.|$|E
25|$|The three {{theories}} {{taken together}} are {{often seen as}} being <b>the</b> <b>hallmarks</b> <b>of</b> the IS tradition, although this is contested by some former leaders of the IS, including Nigel Harris and Michael Kidron both of whom worked on the PAE and now repudiate it, and by some other Trotskyists outside the IS Tradition.
