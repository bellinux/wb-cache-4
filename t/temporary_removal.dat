The Montenegrins quickly developed grievances against the Italians related to the expulsion of Montenegrins from Kosovo and Vojvodina, the influx of refugees {{from other parts of}} Yugoslavia, and those fleeing Ustaše terror in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also had grievances against the Italian annexation of important food producing territory in Kosovo and a salt producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania, and the economic damage inflicted on many Montenegrins by the <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and above from circulation. By the time of the invasion, Đurišić had been promoted to the rank of kapetan prve klase (captain first class).|$|E

He {{was active in the}} Commission of National Education and the Society for Elementary Books, where he was {{prominent}} in developing plans to expand the national network of schools. He spent two years in Warsaw, but returned to Kraków, where he reformed the Kraków Academy, of which board he sat from 1777, and of which he was a rector in 1783-1786. The reform of the Academy was very substantial; bringing it to the modern standards, or even exceeding them. Notably, he switched the Latin language in which the lectures were taking place to Polish language; such a move from Latin to a national language in higher education was still uncommon in Europe. The reform proved controversial enough that an intrigue by his political enemies resulted in his <b>temporary</b> <b>removal,</b> under accusation of corruption and immorality, from Kraków in 1781, although by 1782 the decision was rescinded.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1919 the {{dissatisfied}} had {{an opportunity}} to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky's leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000, and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts. The Red Army had defeated the White Army's spring offensive in the east and was about to cross the Ural Mountains and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral Alexander Kolchak's forces. But in the south, General Anton Denikin's White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On 6 June commander-in-chief Vatsetis ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander Sergey Kamenev (a former colonel of the Imperial army), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members Ivar Smilga, Mikhail Lashevich and Sergey Gusev vigorously protested and wanted to keep the emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front. Trotsky, who had earlier had conflicts with the leadership of the Eastern Front, including a <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> of Kamenev in May 1919, supported Vatsetis.|$|E

500|$|Cromwell's head {{remained}} on a spike above Westminster Hall {{until the late}} 1680s, not counting a <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> for roof maintenance in 1681. The position of the head, {{in relation to the}} heads of Bradshaw and Ireton, has been called into question. Pearson and Morant upheld the originally understood position—traditionally, Bradshaw's head was in the middle, with Cromwell to the right and Ireton to the left— through careful analysis of contemporary poems and plans. The circumstances in which Cromwell's head came into private ownership are rumoured to be tied with a great storm towards the end of James II's reign (16851689), which broke the pole bearing the head, throwing it to the ground. A sentinel guarding the Exchequer's Office came across it, after which he hid it under his cloak and stored it, hidden, in the chimney of his house. The loss of the head was still significant in London at the time, and many searched for it, hoping to claim the “considerable reward” being offered for its safe return. The guard, after seeing “the placards which ordered any one possessing it to take it to a certain office...was afraid to divulge the secret”. Only circumstantial evidence has been established for the whereabouts of the head following its fall from Westminster Hall until 1710, when it was in the possession of Claudius Du Puy, a Swiss-French collector of curiosities, who displayed it in his private museum in London. According to Fitzgibbons, Du Puy's museum was internationally famous and ranked among the top attractions in London at the time, attracting visitors such as a traveller named Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach, who was not impressed by what he saw. After hearing Du Puy's boast that he could sell the head for as much as 60 guineas (£63, or the equivalent of about £5000 in today's British money), Uffenbach exclaimed his surprise that [...] "this monstrous head could still be so dear and worthy to the English".|$|E

40|$|Do Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) react {{strategically}} {{to financial}} incentives {{and if so}} how? To address this question, we follow a quasi-natural experiment in Quebec, using a panel system technique. In so doing, we both correct for underestimation biases in earlier time series findings and generate new results {{on the issue of}} complementarity|substitution between consultations with varying levels of technicality. Under both techniques, we show that PCPs are sensitive to the enforcement and subsequent <b>temporary</b> <b>removals</b> of expenditure caps and more generally, to changes in consultations' relative prices over time. These results support the existence of a discretionary power over the choice of consultation, PCPs increasing strategically the number of the more technical (and therefore more lucrative) consultations when pressed to defend their income. This finding for primary care parallels the now well-established DRG creep in hospitals. The panel system approach offers a better account of the complexity surrounding PCPs' decision-making process. In particular, it successfully addresses issues of physician heterogeneity, jointness between consultations and temporal breaks and generates robust estimates of PCPs volume and quality reactions to regulatory changes.

2500|$|The Winter {{festival is}} known {{primarily}} through Cicero's account, supplemented by later Roman authors.

Then the magistrate's wife and her assistants made bowers of vine-leaves, and decorated the house's banqueting hall with [...] "all manner of growing and blooming plants" [...] except for myrtle, whose presence and naming were expressly forbidden. A banquet table was prepared, with a couch (pulvinar) for the goddess {{and the image of}} a snake. The Vestals brought Bona Dea's cult image from her temple and laid it upon her couch, as an honoured guest. The goddess' meal was prepared: the entrails (exta) of a sow, sacrificed to her on behalf of the Roman people (pro populo Romano), and a libation of sacrificial wine. The festival continued through the night, a women-only banquet with female musicians, fun and games (ludere), and wine; the last was euphemistically referred to as [...] "milk", and its container as a [...] "honey jar".

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the surgical outcome of deep lateral orbital decompression {{with or without}} rim removal. Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Thirty-two patients (47 orbits) with Graves’ orbitopathy who underwent simple deep lateral decompression or balanced lateral plus medial decompression. Of the 14 patients (24 orbits) who underwent simple deep lateral decompression, 8 (13 orbits) had <b>temporary</b> rim <b>removal</b> and in 6 (11 orbits) the rim was left intact. Of the 18 patients (23 orbits) who underwent a balanced decompression, 7 (9 orbits) had <b>temporary</b> rim <b>removal</b> and in 11 (14 orbits) the rim was left intact. The amount of postoperative reduction in proptosis was compared among these four groups. Results: The average reduction in proptosis in the simple deep lateral decompression group was 5. 73 mm (range: 4. 0 – 8. 0 mm) in the rim removal group and 4. 09 mm (range: 2. 5 – 6. 0 mm) in the intact rim group (P = 0. 005). The average reduction in proptosis in the balanced decompression group was 6. 39 mm (range: 5. 0 – 8. 5 mm) in the rim removal group and 5. 07 mm (range: 3. 0 – 8. 0 mm) in the intact rim group (P = 0. 039). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in proptosis reduction between the simple deep lateral decompression with rim removal group and the balanced decompression with an intact rim group (P = 0. 220). Conclusion: The rim removal approach allows a more effective decompression than the intact rim approach.
