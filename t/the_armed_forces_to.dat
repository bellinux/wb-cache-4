5|$|Eventually a rift {{developed}} between Amin and Obote, {{exacerbated by the}} support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote {{took control of the}} armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> that of commander of the army.|$|E

In November of that year, Local Board No. 14 announced that 21 local men would be drafted into the military, the highest total to be called since the Korean War. Of the 21, two were residents of Patterson.

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to France Wick was {{promoted}} to Hauptmann and on 9 September was named Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of I. Gruppe JG2. During September he continued adding to his score, and on 5 October gained his 41st combat victory {{on his way to}} overtake his two closest rivals, Major Adolf Galland and Oberstleutnant Mölders. The 41st victory earned him his second reference in the Wehrmachtbericht on 6 October 1940. He also became the fourth member of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves directly from Hitler at Berghof in Bavaria on 8 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{role in the}} Pacific War {{declined}} from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government {{to reduce the size}} of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish Armed Forces {{consists}} of the Land Forces, the Naval Forces and the Air Force. The Gendarmerie and the Coast Guard operate as parts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in peacetime, although they are subordinated to the Army and Navy Commands respectively in wartime, during which they have both internal law enforcement and military functions. The Chief of the General Staff is appointed by the President and is responsible to the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Parliament for matters of national security and the adequate preparation of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> defend the country. However, the authority to declare war and to deploy the Turkish Armed Forces to foreign countries or to allow foreign armed forces to be stationed in Turkey rests solely with the Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Until the Song dynasty took {{advantage}} of a large rebellion within the Liao Kingdom in 1125, the Song had to conduct cordial relations with the Liao. Skilled ambassadors were sent on missions to court the Liao and maintain peace, such as the renowned horologist, engineer, and state minister Su Song. The Song also prepared for armed conflict, increasing the overall size of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> a million soldiers by 1022. By that time, however, the military was consuming three-quarters of the tax revenues gathered by the state, compared to a mere 2 or 3 percent of state income that would be consumed by just providing the Liao with tribute. Due to these circumstances, intense political rivalries would later arise in the Song court over how to handle these issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to nationalise AESC and develop Leigh Creek {{proved to be}} prescient. In early 1947, mines in New South Wales were again crippled by strikes. The worst strike came in 1949, forcing Chifley to send in <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> extract coal. While the other states had to suffer industrial power rationing and thus reduced manufacturing output and more unemployment, South Australia managed to escape as the miners at Leigh Creek worked around the clock. Within four years the mine was operating at a surplus and the town was further rewarded with federal funding. From 1947 {{until the end of}} Playford's leadership in 1965, the output of the mine increased tenfold to almost two million tons a year. Transport infrastructure was improved, European immigrant workers were recruited, and twin power plants at Port Augusta were completed in 1960 and named after the premier. The new plants exclusively used Leigh Creek coal and by 1970, the whole state was self-sufficient for electricity. ETSA and the mine were generating enough revenue to maintain the town—sometimes dubbed Uncle Tom's Baby—and mine of Leigh Creek and making a profit as well. From 1946 to 1965, the proportion of South Australians connected to electricity increased from 70 to 96%.|$|E

25|$|The Communist Party had {{a number}} of {{mechanisms}} of control over the country's armed forces.

25|$|A British {{military}} expert, Michael Orr, {{claims that}} the hierarchy had great difficulty in fully understanding the changed situation, due to their education.
