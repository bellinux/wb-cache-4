5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E

Affluence, automation, consumerism, and American power would grow; social equity would simply <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> on a rising tide of abundance; [...] the human race would master nature through technology rather than view it in terms of ecology. In contrast, 12years later—even in far more conservative Spokane, Washington—Expo '74 took environmentalism as its central theme.|$|E

In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up.

[...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E

Morgan loaned about $1.5 billion (approximately $ billion in today's dollars) to the Allies to fight against the Germans. Morgan also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France, thus profiting from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.|$|E

The long logs that it was our pride to cut and carry! The accuracy with which we laid them one upon another, hewn to the line and bulletproof. The Cyclopean doors that we hung, with sliding blots fit to be the 'mast of some great admiral!' And when we had 'made the pile complete' some marplot of the Regular Army came that way and chatted a few moments with our commander, and we made an earthwork away off {{on one side of the}} road (leaving the other side to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself)</b> and camped outside it in tents!

Back then the local vet <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> your livestock, but your dog <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> As the country became more urban and affluent, societal attitudes toward pets matured. What followed was a growing demand for advanced medical care for companion animals. This movement has manifested into the migration of various human treatments, technologies and "luxuries" into animal care. Cancer therapies, digital imaging and fully furnished suites for animal boarding are common in veterinary practices today. A developing area in which Shor-Line has become particularly interested is animal rehabilitation. Treadmills, therapeutic lasers and ultrasound are used today for these purposes. This area will be the focus of Donahue's remarks...|$|R

In {{countries}} that have extensive private pension systems such as the US, UK and Ireland, the private sector largely <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> through either occupational or personal pension plans.

This has been achieved by the introduction of defined contribution (DC) pension schemes.
