5|$|Another {{claim for}} {{the origin of}} the term comes from the works of science fiction author Motoko Arai, who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> themselves.

5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among those words are sharia, <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E
5|$|Overhill Cherokee was <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> the Cherokee people {{located in}} their {{historic}} settlements {{in what is}} now the U.S. state of Tennessee in the Southeastern United States, {{on the west side of}} the Appalachian Mountains. This name was used by 18th-century European traders and explorers from British colonies along the Atlantic coast, as they had to cross the mountains to reach these settlements.|$|E
5|$|Sundanese or Priangan Batik is <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> batik {{from the}} Priangan region of West Java and Banten. Although Priangan batiks {{can use a}} wide range of colours, a {{preference}} for indigo is seen in some of its variants. Natural indigo dye made from Indigofera is among the oldest known dyes in Java, and its local name tarum has lent its name to the Citarum river and the Tarumanagara kingdom, which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of natural indigo. Noted Priangan batik is produced in Ciamis, Garut, and Tasikmalaya. Other traditions include Batik Kuningan influenced by batik Cirebon, batik Banten that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of batik Baduy.|$|E

5|$|The Ineligibility Clause has {{interfered}} with appointments {{as far back}} as 1793. President George Washington attempted to appoint William Paterson to the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of Associate Justice Thomas Johnson. However, Paterson, who was serving as Governor of New Jersey, had previously been elected to serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793. Washington withdrew the nomination and withheld it until the afternoon of March 4, when <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> the disqualifying office had expired.|$|E
5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> the kind of weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved {{in the opposite direction}} of a cyclone. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> the {{president}} is five years, but due to a 1996 referendum, the election {{that was supposed to}} occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, {{the president}} could only serve for two terms as president, but due to a change in the constitution, term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in 1994, 2001, 2006, 2010 and on 11 October 2015. Alexander Lukashenko has been the only person who has served as president since the elections in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Very little flow (less than 10 ml) {{is called}} hypomenorrhea. Regular cycles with {{intervals}} of 21 days or fewer are polymenorrhea; frequent but irregular menstruation {{is known as}} metrorrhagia. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed menorrhagia. Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is menometrorrhagia. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea. Amenorrhea refers to more than {{three to six months}} without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.|$|E
5|$|Washington was {{admitted}} to the Union on November 11, 1889. <b>The</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> governor is four years, commencing on the second Monday in the January following the election. If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is unable to discharge their duties, the lieutenant governor assumes the office of governor. If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are unable to fulfill their duties, the secretary of state is next in line, and then the treasurer. There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve. The office of lieutenant governor is not elected on the same ticket as the governor.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{a formal}} opinion by the Attorney General {{concluded}} that resignation from Congress does not free a member {{to be appointed}} to civil office because the Clause speaks to <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns. Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment {{to the position of}} United States Tariff Commissioner. In 1896, the Comptroller of the Treasury determined, after the fact, that former Senator Matthew Ransom's appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.|$|E

5|$|There {{were four}} Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to Barack Obama. The first two rollbacks {{concerned}} appointees of Republicans William Howard Taft and Richard Nixon, {{and the last}} two were implemented for appointees of Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to the conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>for</b> which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment {{in spite of the}} reduction.|$|E
