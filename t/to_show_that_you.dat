I wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can have a child and you can work hard {{and you can get}} your body back. I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just doing what I can {{to make it look}} good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Hafer of Influx Magazine rated it A− and wrote, [...] "It's {{worth your}} time and is awfully good and just goes <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't need mega-stars and mega-budgets {{to make a good}} film." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Carter took a {{step back}} and parleyed. [...] "I'll come along with you of my own free will," [...] he said, hastily, [...] "just <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are wrong; but I won't be forced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now you are angry, {{and take}} seriously what I meant purely in fun. You don't know me even yet! <b>To</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have not been}} mistaken in me, I do propose {{to carry out this}} licence. I'll marry you, dear Nicholas, to-morrow morning.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2013 the FDA {{released}} the observational notes from an inspection of Burzynski {{as a principal}} investigator that took place between January and March 2013. Among the findings were “ to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome, therapeutic response , for 67% of study subjects reviewed during the inspection,” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria, failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons, and failure to report all adverse events. Further, the FDA told Burzynski, [...] "You failed to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under your care. Forty-eight (48) subjects experienced 102 investigational overdoses between January 1, 2005 and February 22, 2013 [...] There is no documentation <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have implemented corrective actions during this time period {{to ensure the safety}} and welfare of subjects.” The FDA also observed that Burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug. Lastly, the FDA observed: [...] "Your [...] tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and on-study treatment [...] studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review", meaning {{that there was no way}} for the FDA to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must ask}} some one else--it wouldn't do," [...] he said. [...] "I have never taken a dollar I didn't earn, and, you see, I would {{scarcely}} have tried <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must clear out right away if I {{had meant to}} make a profit by your doing so." ...|$|R
50|$|A paper Monatstürplakette (monthly placard) {{was issued}} to place {{on your door}} or in your window <b>to</b> <b>show</b> others <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had given, and also to keep the roaming bands of charity workers at bay.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fanny!' said Louisa, glancing round, with a {{gathering}} alarm. 'Only look at me. Only {{open your eyes}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hear and understand me; will you? Good Heaven, gentlemen, {{what is to be}} done!' ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY UTTERWORD. You will {{probably}} be killed, too, Randall. Now play your flute <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not afraid; and be good. Play us [...] "Keep the home fires burning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is just it, Miles? You {{speak in}} a way <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not {{satisfied}} with yourself--neither you nor Rupert is satisfied with himself, if the truth were known." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly. And {{it asked}} for two pounds. Evidently in payment of a debt, and {{the tone of}} the letter {{certainly}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were not then in possession of the money.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} my duty <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have not chosen wrongly, Sir Eustace. I cannot promise to {{maintain}} you here, for {{you might be}} attacked when I have no army with which I could succour you. As soon as I return home and learn which {{of those who have}} fallen have left no heirs, and whose lands therefore have come into my gift, I will then make choice of a new estate for you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Saxton, simply. [...] "I don't quite {{think it}} would. Still, I've seen enough <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{can take the}} {{sensible}} point of view. We both want dollars, and I can't afford to be particular. I'm not sure you can, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the paper}} you write upon {{will be all}} over coronets,--that is, if ever you do write. Perhaps you will to Bernard some day, just <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are staying at a castle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly; only do {{something}} first <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are so. I mean also {{to look to}} that; but I shall be well contented if I find myself in the house in twenty years' time,--or perhaps in thirty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly--exactly," [...] said Santerre, {{interrupting}} him, [...] "you are {{a cripple}} I see. There {{is no evidence}} wanting <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> haven't taken up arms. It is this pestilent son of yours has brought you into trouble." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dana Delany {{spoke about}} her character, Jordan Shaw: [...] "She's there {{as an example}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Beckett <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{actually}} can have it all.

5000|$|Mike's {{music has}} spanned many {{different}} genres throughout his career, {{which he has}} not seen as a problem, stating [...] "I think it just goes <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> what <b>you</b> want out of music isn't necessarily as narrow minded as it being just guitars, or computers, it's about feeling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} wasn't fair, {{but about}} its being robbery, that's questionable. You shouldn't have left your game without leaving something {{on top of}} it, a knife or anything, just <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were coming back for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will decide}} to take me, Harry," [...] the lad said confidently, and then added with a laugh: [...] "the fact {{that you should have}} adopted a plan like this is quite {{sufficient}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want somebody to look after you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay," [...] {{said the}} Duke, [...] "that {{is more than}} is needful, or may be advisable. The {{presence}} of your Scottish Guard, and two hundred choice lances, will serve <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a free agent. A large army might--" ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Adam Curtis the {{production}} is [...] "the {{story of an}} enchanted world that was built by American power as it became supreme...and how those living in that dream world responded to it". He has also said; [...] "it’s trying <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the way <b>you</b> feel about yourself {{and the way you}} feel about the world today is a political product of the ideas of that time”.

6000|$|William {{passed his}} hand across his eyes, and murmured with august satisfaction, 'Blessings on your attachment, my poor dear fellow!'

6000|$|... "And I suppose," [...] went on Fisher, smoothly, [...] "that is why you, too, told us {{lies about}} having found Hook alive. You {{knew there was}} {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might have killed him, and you didn't dare tell us he was killed. But, believe me, it's much better to be honest now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{now comes}} the {{question}} of subjective and objective, and I was as innocent as possible of any intention of plunging into such a sea, or bringing those furrows into your forehead, dear Honor! See {{what it is to}} talk to you and Miss Fennimore's pupil. All things, human and divine, have arisen out of my simple endeavour <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must come to Castle Blanch, the planners of the feast having so ordained, and it being good for all parties, due from the fairy godmother to the third princess, and seriously giving Cilly another chance of returning within the bounds of discretion.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{go along}} the path {{at the foot of}} the hill," [...] he {{bellowed}} rapidly, [...] "and follow it down to the sea, you get a little bay full of red sandstone rocks--you can't miss it--and there's a fine view of the island from there. I'd like awfully well <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> It's great." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} take white trash T-shirts and {{make it into a}} video. I wanted it to look as phony as possible, I wanted the clouds to go one direction, the {{mountains}} to go one direction, the horses to go over there, cause I want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this is The Hunger Games. I want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the type of}} imagery that's been presented to all of us. And the only difference is a black dude in the middle of it." ...|$|R
