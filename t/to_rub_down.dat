50|$|In Australia, plaster or cement render that {{is applied}} to {{external}} brickwork on dwellings or commercial buildings can be one or two coats. In two coat render a base coat is applied with a common mix of 4 parts sand to one part cement and one part dehydrated lime and water to make a consistent mortar. Render is applied using a hawk and trowel and pushed on about 12 mm thick to begin. For two coat, some plasterers apply two full depth bands of render (one {{at the base of}} the wall and one around chest height) which are screed plumb and square and allowed to dry while applying the first coat over the remaining exposed wall. The render is then scratched to provide a key for the second coat. This method allows the rest of the wall to be rendered and screed off without the need to continually check if the second coat is plumb. Alternatively, both coats can be applied with the plasterer using a t-bar to screed the final coat until it is plumb straight and square. The first method is generally used where quality of finish is at a premium. The second method is quicker but can be several millimeters out of plumb. The second coat can be a slightly weaker mix 5/1/1, or the same as the base coat with maybe a water proofer in the mix added to the water to minimize efflorescence (rising of salts). Some plasterers used lime putty in second coat instead of dehydrated lime in the render. The mortar {{is applied to}} about 5 mm thick and when the render hardens is screeded off straight. A wood float or plastic float is used <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> the walls. Traditionally, water is splashed on walls using a coarse horsehair plasterers brush followed by immediately rubbing the float in a circular or figure 8 motion although a figure of 8 can leave marks. Many modern plasterers use a hose with a special nozzle with a fine mist spray to dampen walls when rubbing up (using a wood float to bring a consistent finish). Using a hose brings a superior finish and is more consistent in colour as there is more chance in catching the render before it has a chance to harden too much. After the work area is floated, the surface is finished with a wet sponge using the same method as floating with a wood float, bringing sand to the surface to give a smooth consistent finish.|$|E
6000|$|Glumly the Hall boys {{retired to}} their {{dressing}} room, there <b>to</b> be <b>rubbed</b> <b>down</b> by their chums. [...] "It's too bad, it certainly is," [...] {{came from a}} dozen sympathizers.|$|R

60|$|The Captain was a {{tall man}} of about forty, grey at the temples. He had a handsome, finely knit figure, {{and was one of}} the best {{horsemen}} in the West. His orderly, having <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> him <b>down,</b> admired the amazing riding-muscles of his loins.|$|R
60|$|The words was 'ardly out of {{my mouth}} afore 'e gave a lurch and spilt his pint all over me.

60|$|A tumbling, muffled {{noise from}} within the dark house startled him. Then he heard her voice:--'There are clothes.' He rose {{and went to the}} foot of the stairs, and {{gathered}} up the garments she had thrown down. Then he came back to the fire, <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> himself <b>down</b> and dress. He grinned at his own appearance when he had finished.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stop, Misses Brown!' {{cried the}} distracted Grinder. 'What {{are you doing}} of? Don't put {{yourself}} in a passion! Don't let her go, if you please. I haven't meant any offence. I said [...] "how d'ye do," [...] at first, didn't I? But you wouldn't answer. How you do? Besides,' said Rob piteously, 'look here!

6000|$|... "My aunt," [...] {{said the}} narrator, [...] "was {{a woman of}} spirit, and apt to take the law into her own hands. She had her own notions of {{cleanliness}} also.

6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} {{whatever}} {{to do with}} the horses or the trip, except <b>to</b> help <b>rub</b> them <b>down</b> when we stopped, and to drive home," [...] replied Ralph, almost indignant that George should think even for a moment that he would have countenanced such a thing.|$|R
6000|$|The drawing was by {{this time}} all pencilled in most elaborately, and the middy opened the water-colour box to examine the paints. As he did so, he again remarked on the {{familiar}} English look of the materials, and was about <b>to</b> begin <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> a little {{of one of the}} cakes--moist colours had not been invented--when he observed some writing in red paint {{on the back of the}} palette. He started and flushed, while his heart beat faster, for the writing was, [...] "Expect me. Rub this out. H.S." ...|$|R
6000|$|Daisy {{turned her}} quickened glance again {{from one of}} the gentlemen beside her to the other.

6000|$|... 'I reckon you {{are about}} right,' {{the oldest of the}} party said; 'a man who takes care of his beast gets paid for it. You don't have no trouble in the morning. Your three critters come in at once when they hear you whistle. I watched them this morning and saw you give them each a hunch of bread and then set <b>to</b> work <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> them <b>down</b> and brush their coats, and I says to myself, [...] "That is what ought to be between horse and master.

60|$|Leaving Pierre <b>to</b> {{unsaddle}} and <b>rub</b> <b>down</b> his horse, Philip {{walked to}} the farther edge of the wood, to view the country beyond. They were, he knew, not far from La Chatre; {{and he was not}} surprised to see the town, lying in a valley, to which the ground sloped down from the wood. It was about {{a mile and a half}} distant. Nearer the wood, but half a mile to the west, the towers of a fortified chateau rose from a clump of trees. The country was rich and well cultivated, and everything had an aspect of peace and comfort.|$|R
25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art {{galleries}} at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> the statue <b>down</b> with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.|$|R

6000|$|I would I {{could tell}} you the moving story of our cart and cart-horses; the latter are dapple-grey, about sixteen hands, and of {{enormous}} substance; the former {{was a kind of}} red and green shandry-dan with a driving bench; plainly unfit to carry lumber or to face our road. (Remember that the last third of my road, about a mile, is all made out of a bridle- track by my boys - and my dollars.) It was supposed a white man had been found - an ex-German artilleryman - to drive this last; he proved incapable and drunken; the gallant Henry, who had never driven before, and knew nothing about horses - except the rats and weeds that flourish on the islands - volunteered; Moors accepted, proposing to follow and supervise: despatched his work and started after. No cart! he hurried on up the road - no cart. Transfer the scene to Vailima, where on a sudden to Fanny and me, the cart appears, apparently at a hard gallop, some two hours before it was expected; Henry radiantly ruling chaos from the bench. [...] It stopped: it was long before we had time to remark that the axle was twisted like the letter L. Our first care was the horses. There they stood, black with sweat, the sweat raining from them - literally raining - their heads down, their feet apart - and blood running thick from the nostrils of the mare. We got out Fanny's under-clothes - couldn't find anything else but our blankets - <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> them <b>down,</b> and in about half an hour we had the blessed satisfaction to see one after the other take a bite or two of grass. But it was a toucher; a little more and these steeds would have been foundered.|$|R
60|$|The {{shades of}} evening were {{beginning}} to fall, when he rejoined his companions. They had already <b>rubbed</b> <b>down</b> their horses and replaced the saddles, and the animals were contentedly eating their corn.|$|R
60|$|A little {{distance}} up the street, Kermode stopped {{outside a}} shed {{in which a}} fellow of unprepossessing appearance was <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> a horse. His character, as Kermode knew, was no better than his looks.|$|R
60|$|The hired man {{was very}} much put out, for it was his fault that the horse had run away. He led the animal around to the barn {{and gave him a}} good <b>rubbing</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{returned}} the boy, regarding it attentively, [...] "we might {{try it on}} Aglootook's nose. That wants cutting short, and <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> too, for it seems very hard to look at it." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} away to the stables, where Jimmy, who came in with an armful of clothing, found him <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> the Cayuse with unusual solicitude, {{in spite of its}} {{attempts}} to kick him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's give 'em a <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> with mud!" [...] cried Jerry Koswell. He {{had some}} tar handy, {{and if the}} mud was used he {{intended}} to mix some of the tar with it on the sly.|$|R
