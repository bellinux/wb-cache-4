5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> real according to Tulsidas, {{in keeping with the}} Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, {{as well as the}} attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

5|$|In 2029, {{aboard the}} United States Air Force space station Oberon, Leo Davidson {{works closely with}} {{primates}} who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat human beings as slaves.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> {{the best of all possible}} worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature {{at a safe distance}} from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E

25|$|Experts {{argue that}} this older {{assessment}} of global politics is too simplified, {{in part because of}} the difficulty in classifying the European Union at its current stage of development.

2500|$|Amery {{was opposed}} to the Constitution of the League of Nations because he {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> not equal and so the League, which granted all states equal voting rights was absurd.

25|$|According to Rupert Gethin, taṇhā {{is related}} to aversion and ignorance. Craving leads to aversion, anger, cruelty and violence, states Gethin, which are {{unpleasant}} states and cause suffering to one who craves. Craving is based on misjudgement, states Gethin, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> permanent, unchanging, stable, and reliable. Leifer relates taṇhā to avidya (moho), because {{it is based on}} the mistaken presumption that the samsaric dance of opposites is ultimate reality.|$|E
25|$|All {{schools of}} Vedanta {{subscribe}} {{to the theory of}} Satkāryavāda, which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship {{and the nature of the}} empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The Brahma Sutras, the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, support Parinamavada, the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> a real transformation (parinama) of Brahman.|$|E
25|$|The Bogomils had {{a system}} of altered {{traditional}} orthodox beliefs and rituals. The essence behind their teaching was a dualistic doctrine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> divided by God and Satan (good and evil). God rules the spiritual part of the world, and Satan the material. They regarded every material being to {{be the work of}} Satan. They also opposed established forms of government and church as alike to anarchism (see Christian anarchism).|$|E
5000|$|Buddhists {{believe the}} {{beginning}} of this world and of life is inconceivable since they have neither beginning nor end.

25|$|Typology {{is based}} on a view of the world {{familiar}} from Plato's metaphysics called essentialism. Essentialism is the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> divided into real, discontinuous and immutable ‘kinds’. This idea is the basis for most typological constructions, particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are often thought of as ‘mental templates’, or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen {{as a consequence of the}} imperfect realization of the template, and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{pointed out}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> not always green, {{and that when}} it is, herbivores do not {{necessarily}} {{play an important role}} in structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967). Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966). The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top-down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|There is, in parallel, a {{discussion}} on this subject by scientists in the Orthodox Jewish community. One {{of the most prominent}} is Gerald Schroeder, an MIT trained physicist.

25|$|The pink {{sandstone}} {{sculptures of}} Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) {{to reach a}} very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to be temporally the first. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not demonstrable by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E
