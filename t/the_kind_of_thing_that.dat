25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that this is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She {{wrote a letter to the}} author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Hanneman, Lombardo and Suicidal Tendencies guitarist Rocky George {{had a brief}} {{hardcore}} punk {{side project}} called [...] "Pap Smear" [...] – the band had many tracks and was due to start recording when Hanneman was advised to avoid the side project by Slayer's producer, Rick Rubin, who {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Ahhhh, don't do it, man – this is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> breaks bands up!" [...] and Hanneman took Rubin's advice. Only a demo was recorded, consisting of Hanneman on vocals and bass, Lombardo on drums and George on guitar. Later two of the songs were re-recorded on Slayer's 1996 album Undisputed Attitude.|$|E
500|$|The board {{found that}} Oppenheimer's {{association}} with Chevalier [...] "is not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> our security system permits {{on the part}} of one who customarily has access to information of the highest classification", and concluded that [...] "Oppenheimer's continuing conduct reflects a serious disregard for the requirements of the security system," [...] that he was susceptible [...] "to influence which could have serious implications for the security interests of the country," [...] that his attitude toward the H-bomb program raised doubt about whether his future participation [...] "would be consistent with the best interests of security," [...] and that Oppenheimer had been [...] "less than candid in several instances" [...] in his testimony. The majority therefore did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.|$|E

She also announced that she will be launching her official charity for student loans and tuition payments in the near future. In the same month, Minaj revealed on Instagram that she has been donating money to an Indian village for a few years via her pastor Lydia Sloley. These donations helped the village get a computer center, a tailoring institute, a reading program and two water wells.

500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{gave the}} song a four (out of five)-star rating, and wrote that its {{production}} {{was of a}} [...] "summer anthem level". Corner said the track felt [...] "slightly lighter" [...] than Azalea's previous releases, adding: [...] "... but if it means she crosses over into superstardom territory, it's a job well done". While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity". Complex reviewers were also divided; Brian Josephs considered the track a [...] " [...] club banger", but David Drake criticized Azalea's [...] "nimble rapping and forced accent". According to Drake, [...] " [...] is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> might work in the UK, where a digitally-animated frog once had a No. 1 hit with a cover of the theme to Beverly Hills Cop, but this {{will probably be a}} long shot at getting stateside club play". John Robinson of The Guardian felt it was [...] "second-division" [...] and [...] "sheeeeeit". Karen Lawler of Blues & Soul opined that it recalled [...] "a lost track" [...] from Miley Cyrus' 2013 album, Bangerz, and dismissed its [...] "nod" [...] to 2 Unlimited as [...] "cringe worthy". While Clash called [...] "Bounce" [...] an inferior version of [...] "No Limit" [...] and [...] "criminal in every way", and opined that it lacked tune; [...] "No Auto-Tune, though, because you need a tune to Auto".|$|E
2500|$|To Judge Rich, {{even though}} section 101 says [...] "whoever invents or discovers," [...] {{there is no}} basis for {{importing}} into the analysis any inquiry {{into the nature of}} what it is that the patent applicants purports to have invented, and whether it is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can be patented as an invention. Thus, when the Flook Court says that Flook's process {{is not the kind of}} process that the patent law permits to be patented, even though it is a process in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word, Judge Rich finds the inquiry impermissible because [...] "§ 101 was never intended to be a 'standard of patentability'; the standards, or conditions as the statute calls them, are in § 102 and § 103." [...] The only legitimate question, he says, is whether the claimed subject matter is [...] "new, useful, and unobvious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lowenthal {{has been}} {{involved}} in several live-action projects with his company Monkey Kingdom Productions with wife Tara Platt. In 2008, they [...] produced Con Artists, a mockumentary that chronicles some of their convention visits. They produced a psychological thriller film called Tumbling After which garnered an Award of Merit at the Accolade Film Festival. In 2011, Lowenthal and Platt produced Shelf Life, a web series where they act as action figures in a Toy Story-like environment, but with more adult humor. Lowenthal {{said in an interview that}} he wanted to make a show for nerds: [...] "I wanted to make <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> my friends and I would watch. It’s got the four S’s: Sex, Social commentary, Slapstick and Superheroes."

2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, {{but there are}} still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, {{as if he were a}} schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{law which}} is {{applicable}} {{to this case}} is section 101 of the Patent Act. If Flook's patent claim can meet {{the definition of a}} [...] "process" [...] under that law then it is patent-eligible (that is, it is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can receive a patent if it is also novel, unobvious, and the like). The Court decided that the patent claim under review was instead a claim to a [...] "principle" [...] or a [...] "law of nature" [...] and thus not patent-eligible. The Court relied on a line of cases following from the Neilson blast furnace case. The principle of that case, as explained in O’Reilly v. Morse, is that that patent-eligibility must be analyzed on the basis of it being as if the principle, algorithm, or mathematical formula were already well known (was in the prior art). Flook's process is thus ineligible for a patent [...] "because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention."

2500|$|Although Rivette {{submitted}} {{his film}} to the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques because it [...] "was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> would have pleased my parents", {{he was not}} accepted by the school. He took courses at the Sorbonne, but began frequenting screenings at Henri Langlois's Cinémathèque Française with Bouchet instead of attending classes. At the Cinémathèque, Rivette, [...] Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman, Gruault and Bouchet were immersed in films from the silent and early [...] "talkie" [...] eras that they were previously unfamiliar with. He and this group of young cinephiles became acquainted as they customarily sat in the Cinématographique's front row for screenings; Rivette met Truffaut at a screening of The Rules of the Game, and sat next to Godard for several months before the latter introduced himself. Rivette was active in post-screening debates, and Rohmer said that in film-quiz competitions at the Studio Parnasse he was [...] "unbeatable". Rivette credited Langlois's screenings and lectures for helping him persevere during his early impoverishment in Paris: [...] "A word from you saved me and opened {{the doors of the}} temple". Unlike his contemporaries, Rivette attended screenings at the Cinémathèque well into the 1970s.|$|E
