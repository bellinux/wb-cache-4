5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National First Ladies' Library, {{there have}} been 47 First Ladyships. This {{discrepancy}} exists because Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and the 24th president; his spouse Frances Cleveland is also counted twice. Following Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017, his spouse, Melania Trump, became the 47th official First Lady, succeeding Michelle Obama, wife of former President Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1961, President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam {{asked the}} United States to conduct aerial {{herbicide}} spraying in his country. In August of that year, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted herbicide operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a policy debate in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> State and Defense Departments. However, U.S. officials considered using it, {{pointing out that}} the British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy authorized the start of Operation Ranch Hand, the codename for the U.S. Air Force's herbicide program in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|White House Astronomy Night (and {{alternatively}} Astronomy Night on the National Mall) is {{an event}} first organized by the White House {{in conjunction with the}} Office of Science and Technology Policy to motivate interest in astronomy and science education.

In 2010 <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Office of Science and Technology Policy organized a similar event with help from Hofstra University, this time held on the National Mall. Between 2010 and 2014 annual events took place at the National Mall with coordination between Hofstra University and federal agencies including: the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. In 2015 an event took place in June at the National Mall, and then back at the White House again on October 19.|$|E

5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E

25|$|The Dan Brown novel Deception Point further perpetuates this {{misconception}} with {{a passage}} that implies the presidential seal embroidered {{on the carpet}} in the White House Oval Office is changed by White House workers.

25|$|At {{one time}} Pennsylvania Avenue {{provided}} an unobstructed view between <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Capitol.

25|$|The {{history of}} Washington, D.C. {{is tied to}} its role as {{the capital of the}} United States. Originally {{inhabited}} by an Algonquian-speaking people known as the Nacotchtank, the site of the District of Columbia along the Potomac River was first selected by President George Washington. The city came under attack during the War of 1812 in an episode known as the Burning of Washington. Upon the government's return to the capital, it had to manage reconstruction of numerous public buildings, including <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States Capitol. The McMillan Plan of 1901 helped restore and beautify the downtown core area, including establishing the National Mall, along with numerous monuments and museums.|$|E
25|$|Architectural classicism {{is heavily}} {{represented}} in all districts of the city, particularly in Downtown, the Fan, and the Museum District.

It is the second-oldest US statehouse in continuous use (after Maryland's) {{and was the first}} US government building built in the neo-classical style of architecture, setting the trend for other state houses and the federal government buildings (including <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Capitol) in Washington, D.C. Robert Mills designed Monumental Church on Broad Street. Adjoining it is the 1845 Egyptian Building, one of the few Egyptian Revival buildings in the United States.|$|E
