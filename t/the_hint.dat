5|$|In 1911, a {{competition}} {{for the design of}} Canberra was launched, and Scrivener's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects. The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a flood plain and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam to create it. Most of the proposals took <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> and included artificial bodies of water.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took <b>the</b> <b>hint,</b> and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E
5|$|Captain Waggett, the stuffy English {{commander}} of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a party in which whisky must be served. Taking <b>the</b> <b>hint,</b> the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload {{a large number of}} cases before the ship goes down. Campbell had been sent to his room by his mother for a prior transgression, but is persuaded to leave and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also fortifies the teetotal Campbell's courage enough so he can stand up to his mother regarding Catriona.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{systematic}} method for incorporating prior knowledge (<b>hints)</b> into <b>the</b> learning-from-examples paradigm. <b>The</b> <b>hints</b> {{are represented in}} a canonical form that is compatible with descent techniques for learning. All <b>the</b> <b>hints</b> are fed to the learning process {{in the form of}} examples, and examples of the function are treated on equal footing with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>hints.</b> During learning, examples from different hints are selected for processing according to a fixed or adaptive schedule. Fixed schedules specify the relative emphasis of each hint, and adaptive schedules are based on how well each hint has been learned so far. We discuss adaptive minimization which is based on estimates of the overall learning error...|$|R

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, {{any notion of}} lesbian love in a film almost always {{required}} audiences to infer the relationships. The lesbian aesthetic of Queen Christina (1933) with Greta Garbo has been widely noted, even though the film is not about lesbians. Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), {{based on the novel}} by Daphne du Maurier, referred more or less overtly to lesbianism, but the two characters involved were not presented positively: Mrs. Danvers was portrayed as obsessed, neurotic and murderous, while the never-seen Rebecca was described as having been selfish, spiteful and doomed to die. All About Eve (1950) was originally written with the title character as a lesbian but this was very subtle in the final version, with <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> and message apparent to alert viewers.|$|E
25|$|The label's biggest early star, soul singer Otis Redding, also {{arrived in}} 1962. Redding, however, {{technically}} {{was not on}} Stax, but on its sister label Volt. In that era, many radio stations, anxious to avoid even <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> of payola, often refused to play {{more than one or}} two new songs from any single record label at one time, so as to not appear to be offering favoritism to any particular label. To circumvent this, Stax, like many other record companies, created a number of subsidiary labels. Volt, founded in late 1961, was the label home to Otis Redding, the Bar-Kays, and a handful of other artists. Volt releases were initially issued by Atlantic through its subsidiary Atco Records. Other Stax subsidiaries over the years included Enterprise, Chalice (a gospel label), Hip, and Safice.|$|E
25|$|This {{made it an}} {{attractive}} destination for the painter Vincent van Gogh, who arrived there on 21 February 1888. He {{was fascinated by the}} Provençal landscapes, producing over 300 paintings and drawings during his time in Arles. Many of his most famous paintings were completed there, including The Night Cafe, the Yellow Room, Starry Night Over the Rhone, and L'Arlésienne. Paul Gauguin visited van Gogh in Arles. However, van Gogh's mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in the well-known ear-severing incident in December 1888 which resulted in two stays in the Old Hospital of Arles. The concerned Arlesians circulated a petition the following February demanding that van Gogh be confined. In May 1889, he took <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> and left Arles for the Saint-Paul asylum at nearby Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.|$|E

40|$|The {{systematic}} use of <b>hints</b> in <b>the</b> learning-from-examples {{paradigm is}} the subject of this review. <b>Hints</b> are <b>the</b> properties of the target function that are known to us independently of the training examples. <b>The</b> use of <b>hints</b> is tantamount to combining rules and data in learning, and is compatible with different learning models, optimization techniques, and regularization techniques. <b>The</b> <b>hints</b> are represented to the learning process by virtual examples, and the training examples of the target function are treated on equal footing with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>hints.</b> A balance is achieved between the information provided by <b>the</b> different <b>hints</b> through <b>the</b> choice of objective functions and learning schedules. The Adaptive Minimization algorithm achieves this balance by relating the performance on each <b>hint</b> to <b>the</b> overall performance. <b>The</b> application of <b>hints</b> in forecasting <b>the</b> very noisy foreign-exchange markets is illustrated. On the theoretical side, the information value of hints is contrasted to the complexity value and related to the VC dimension...|$|R

25|$|To {{make matters}} worse, at {{a late night}} party and jam session during the {{recording}} of the album, attended by Lennon, McCartney, Danny Kortchmar, and other musicians, Nilsson ruptured a vocal cord, but he hid the injury for fear that Lennon would call {{a halt to the}} production. The resulting album was Pussy Cats. In an effort to clean up, Lennon, Nilsson and Ringo Starr first rented a house together, then Lennon and Nilsson left for New York. After the relative failure of his latest two albums, RCA Records considered dropping Nilsson's contract. In a show of friendship, Lennon accompanied Nilsson to negotiations, and both intimated to RCA that Lennon and Starr might want to sign with them, once their Apple Records contracts with EMI expired in 1975, but would not be interested if Nilsson were no longer with the label. RCA took <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> and re-signed Nilsson (adding a bonus clause, to apply to each new album completed), but neither Lennon nor Starr signed with RCA.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand's batting effort started quietly, with Irfan Pathan using <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> {{of swing}} to bowl a maiden to captain Fleming first up. But {{inaccurate}} line and length {{in the next}} five overs allowed New Zealand to plunder 62, Fleming hitting five fours from the 5th over, and the run rate raced along. By the end of 15 power play overs, New Zealand had made 112 for no loss, Fleming having made a 51-ball half-century while Astle was on 45. Ganguly turned to his spinners, banking on Virender Sehwag to give him a few tight overs, and he complied. The first over conceded four runs, and in his second he held a return catch as Fleming went for 61. Four balls later, Hamish Marshall was out for 3, and India were in with a small shout. However, well-timed innings from Scott Styris, who made 37, and Craig McMillan with 13, and the occasional awful over – JP Yadav's only contribution to the match was a 14-run over – left New Zealand with 72 in 12.3 overs with six wickets in hand. With Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle in good hitting form – they took 17 off a Harbhajan over as Astle brought up his 100 with his first six of the match – this was no problem, and Vincent won New Zealand the game by hitting Agarkar for four with 11 balls to spare.|$|E
