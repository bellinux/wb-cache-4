50|$|The ternary {{numeral system}} (also called base-3) has three as its base. Analogous to a bit, a ternary digit is a trit (<b>trinary</b> digit). One trit is {{equivalent}} to log23 (about 1.58496) bits of information.|$|E
50|$|Pi Cephei (π Cephei) is a <b>trinary</b> star {{located in}} the {{constellation}} Cepheus. With an apparent magnitude of about 4.4, the system is faintly {{visible to the naked}} eye.

50|$|Theta1 Orionis A (θ1 Ori A) is a {{variable}} <b>trinary</b> {{star in the}} constellation Orion. Its apparent magnitude range is 6.72 to 7.65 with a period of 65.432 days. It {{is one of the}} main stars in The Trapezium in Orion, along with B, C, and D, as well as the fainter E.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, Merline {{estimated}} Pulcova {{to have a}} density of 1.8 g/cm³, {{which would make it}} more dense than the <b>trinary</b> asteroid 45 Eugenia, and binary 90 Antiope.

50|$|In 2005, it was {{claimed that}} lightcurve {{observations}} indicate that Polonskaya {{has a small}} moon about 0.99 km in diameter. However, the non-synchronously rotating binary {{still needs to be}} fully resolved in order to confirm such satellite. Alternatively, the presence of another body has also been suggested to explain the lightcurve's irregular period, which would make it a <b>trinary</b> asteroid.|$|E
50|$|Theta Lyrae (θ Lyr) {{is a star}} in a <b>trinary</b> star system, in the {{constellation}} Lyra, approximately 770 light years away from Earth. Theta Lyrae is an orange bright giant star of the spectral type K0II, which means that it possesses a surface temperature of about 5,000 kelvins, and is many times bigger and brighter, yet cooler, than the Sun.|$|E
50|$|HD 126614 is a 9th {{magnitude}} <b>trinary</b> star located approximately 240 {{light years}} away in the constellation Virgo. HD 126614 A is a K-type star while HD 126614 B and NLTT 37349 are M-type stars. Star A is larger, cooler, brighter, and more massive than our Sun. Also its metal content is 3.6 {{times as much as}} the Sun, the highest metallicity planet-hosting star discovered in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Moving {{around in}} a car can be {{difficult}} {{in and around the}} city centre because of the many one-way streets and frequent traffic jams. The <b>Trinary</b> Road System allows quick access to the city centre for drivers. Some avenues are spacious and laid out in a grid. Apart from some points around the city centre, Munhoz da Rocha Street and Batel Avenue, traffic jams are not severe.|$|E
50|$|The most {{extensive}} use of haiku in science fiction is in David Brin's Uplift Universe (especially in the novel Startide Rising), where the uplifted dolphins speak a haiku-like language called <b>Trinary.</b> He has characters quoting haiku by Kobayashi Issa and Yosa Buson, and has them spontaneously writing their own haiku. Outside of his Uplift Universe, Brin has haiku as chapter epigrams in his novel The Postman.|$|E
50|$|Ten years later, {{these words}} were re-confirmed by the 2016-17 season final table, which showed a {{distinct}} <b>trinary</b> heirarchy. The 7 teams gaining places in European football were between 15 and 47 points {{ahead of the}} next group of 10, which were all spanned by a difference of just 6 points. A further gap of 6 points separated those mid-ranking teams from the relegation zone.|$|E
