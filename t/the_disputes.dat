5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, {{he had been}} struck by paralysis, and after this {{he seems to have}} withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dispute</b> Settlement in <b>the</b> WTO Veronika Honzíková Abstract <b>The</b> WTO <b>dispute</b> {{settlement}} {{represents a}} significant improvement compared to <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement system under GATT 1947, but is still considered as his successor. The mechanism under GATT 1947 had many weaknesses which resulted to the need of reform. The procedure under GATT 1947 was not contradictory and all members of <b>the</b> <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Body (DSB) were entitled to use the veto right when adopting the reports. The contracting parties were conscious of such weaknesses and they have agreed on a new dispute settlement system during the Uruguay round. <b>The</b> <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Understanding (DSU) {{is part of the}} Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. The new system remains inter-state mechanism and as a consequence, available only to the Member States, excluding individuals and business operators. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement under WTO has become compulsory while leaving each member the choice between this standard procedure and other dispute modes, such as Good Offices, Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement system has been unified and has become more judicial. It excludes national jurisdictions and means strengthening <b>the</b> multilateralism. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement is administrated by <b>the</b> <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Body, [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{bargaining}} council or the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration must {{attempt to}} resolve <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> through conciliation within thirty {{days of the}} referral. If the parties to <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> reach an agreement, <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> is resolved. If no agreement is reached, the conciliator must issue a certificate {{to indicate that the}} matter has not been resolved. After this (or after thirty days have gone by since referral of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> for conciliation), <b>the</b> parties can give notice of the proposed strike (or lock-out).|$|R

Moreover, Spain and Gibraltar could not be drawn in the same group due to <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> status of Gibraltar.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the fifth vow of Aparigraha). <b>The</b> <b>disputes</b> triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations is a {{worldwide}} intergovernmental organization {{that was created}} {{with the goal of}} intervening in <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> between nations, thereby avoiding armed conflict. The U.N. serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law. When the consensus of the membership permits, it provides a mechanism for armed intervention.|$|E
5|$|The tournament was put {{in further}} {{jeopardy}} in January 1979 when General Motors withdrew as a major sponsor; Eagleson argued GM withdrew {{as a result of}} the dispute with the CAHA. <b>The</b> <b>disputes</b> put the two bodies on the verge of severing all ties, a move that would have led to Hockey Canada refusing to release any professional or university player to any of Canada's national teams.

5|$|As {{well as his}} {{chancery}} duties, Neville occasionally {{sat with}} the barons of the exchequer or with royal justices, {{and he had a}} role in the appointment of royal justices. In 1230 he was regent of England while Henry was absent in France, during which time he met with Llywelyn the Great in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate an agreement that would resolve <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> between the English and the Welsh. In 1232, during the events surrounding the de Burgh's downfall Neville, along with Ranulf, the Earl of Chester, urged that de Burgh should not be dragged from sanctuary to face the royal accusations against him. Neville's pleas prevailed for a time, but eventually de Burgh was removed from sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli {{described}} in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
5|$|Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia's borders. The {{boundaries}} were unclear as {{laid out}} by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described. France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula {{was included in the}} treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick. <b>The</b> <b>disputes</b> over Acadia flared into open conflict during King George's War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the Seven Years' War.|$|E
40|$|The Senkaku/Diaoyu {{islands are}} {{a group of}} {{uninhabited}} rocks in the East China Sea. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> for <b>the</b> territorial sovereignty over them openly began between China and Japan in 1968, when ECAFE released findings of massive oil and gas reserves underneath <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> waters. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> is also connected with overlapping claims to exclusive economic zones and to present day remains unresolved. This thesis examines legal justifications of Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese claims, incidents resulting from <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> and their effect on Sino-Japanese relations, modern day development and prospects of a peaceful resolution...|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> first {{arose in}} 1947, but was left {{unresolved}} during {{the existence of}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became a contentious issue after the breakup of Yugoslavia. Particular prominence was given to <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> at <b>the</b> time of Croatia's accession to the European Union. [...] <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> remains unresolved, and the line of control mostly corresponds to Serbia's claim.|$|R
40|$|Paradoxically, {{the ending}} of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> between <b>the</b> National Union of Mineworkers and the National Coal Board has raised several {{questions}} and potential problems rather than led to any enduring solutions. The ending of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> without an agreement, the high numbers of miners applying for voluntary redundancy, and the recent acceptance of the 5. 2 % wage offer refused eighteen months ago, all prompt a questioning of the causes and consequences of <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> <b>The</b> conduct and ending of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> also raise {{a number of important}} issues as to the future pattern of industrial relations within the mining industry and in Britain generally. In addition, the actions of those involved indicate important changes in the roles of the law, the police and Government in collective bargaining arrangements and in <b>the</b> handling of <b>disputes,</b> especially in <b>the</b> public sector. In discussing <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> and its implications, it is first necessary to understand {{the extent to which the}} causes of <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> <b>the</b> conduct of the Government, Police, NCB and NUM, and even the outcome were directly influenced by the 1972 and 1974 national mining disputes...|$|R
5|$|His {{popularity}} among the citizenry had never waned, and support {{continued to be}} evident, even {{on the eve of}} his overthrow and throughout his exile. He was seen as a hero, a model citizen, a caring monarch, and the source of national unity and well-being. Following his death, political wrangling prevented the return of his remains to Brazil. Continued efforts to repatriate the bodies of the Emperor and his wife dragged on for decades. <b>The</b> <b>disputes</b> were resolved and this was finally accomplished in 1920 with much fanfare. Over the decades, PedroII gradually grew within Brazil to represent the archetypical benevolent, self-effacing and effective ruler concerned only for the national welfare.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} coup, {{officers}} loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces, being imprisoned alongside Umran at Mezze prison. One {{of the first}} acts of Jadid's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence. Assad however, {{did not support the}} coup, and told Mansur al-Atrash, Jubran Majdalani, and other Aflaqites that he did not support Jadid's actions. Later, in an interview with Le Monde, Assad claimed that the military's intervention was regrettable because the Ba'ath Party was democratic, and that <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> should have been resolved in a democratic manner. However, Assad did view the actions as necessary, as it put an end, in his view, to the dictatorship of the National Command.|$|E
5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly to avoid <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations {{and is not}} funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) had {{repeatedly}} {{taken up the}} issue of aboriginal title in the United States. However, with the exception of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction, all <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> had been between non-Indianstypically between those who derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians. The uniform rule of these cases, enunciated most clearly in Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823), was that non-Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases. However, the purchase at issue in Fellows, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838), had been ratified by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The Old Debauchees, {{originally}} titled The Despairing Debauchee, {{appeared with}} The Covent-Garden Tragedy on 1 June 1732. The play ran for six nights {{and was later}} paired with The Mock Doctor. The play was later revived to attack Catholics during <b>the</b> <b>disputes</b> with the Stuarts between 1745 and 1746. The play alludes to the 1731 trial of Father Girard, a Jesuit tried for using magic during an attempted seduction/rape of a young girl. The nature of the attacks against Catholicism within the play undermines the overall humour of the play.|$|E
5|$|The pricing of Burger King's value menu {{had been}} the focus of multiple, highly {{contentious}} disputes between the parent company and its franchises for several years during the TPG ownership period. The dispute {{was at the center of}} two separate but related court cases filed against Burger King by an individual Burger King franchise in New York City and the NFA.
