5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of emissions <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

25|$|Insider <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> {{the trading}} of a corporation's stock or other {{securities}} (e.g. bonds or stock options) by individuals with potential access to non-public {{information about the}} company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal, if this <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> done {{in a way that}} does not take advantage of non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company. Illegal insider <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.|$|E

50|$|Industrialization, {{advanced}} technology, including transportation, globalization, multinational corporations, and outsourcing are all {{having a}} major impact on the international trade system. Increasing international <b>trade</b> <b>is</b> crucial to the continuance of globalization. Without international <b>trade,</b> nations would <b>be</b> limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders. International <b>trade</b> <b>is,</b> in principle, not different from domestic trade as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether <b>trade</b> <b>is</b> across a border or not. The main difference <b>is</b> that international <b>trade</b> <b>is</b> typically more costly than domestic <b>trade.</b> The reason <b>is</b> that a border typically imposes additional costs such as tariffs, time costs due to border delays and costs associated with country differences such as language, the legal system or culture.|$|R

25|$|However, {{succeeding}} at <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> {{not without}} its requisite legwork which, according to Faulkner, lies in five key areas: market indicators, trading strategies and money management, emotional management, successful and supportive belief systems, and a winning “metaphoric mindset.” Finally, Koppel quotes The Outer Game of Trading, in which Faulkner briefly explores the dynamics of confidence and fear.|$|E

Part of this so-called tracking error is attributed to the proliferation of ETFs targeting exotic investments or areas where <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> less frequent, such as emerging-market stocks, future-contracts based commodity indices and junk bonds.|$|E
5000|$|Domestic trade, {{also known}} as {{internal}} trade or home <b>trade,</b> <b>is</b> the exchange of domestic goods {{within the boundaries of}} a country.
