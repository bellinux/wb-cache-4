5|$|After {{drawing out}} the Rus armies for nine {{days in a}} feigned retreat, the Mongol army <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> their pursuers along the Kalka River (the river's {{location}} is currently unknown, but it {{is thought to be}} the Kalchik River which flows into the Sea of Azov).* Gabriel, Subotai The Valiant: Genghis Khan's Greatest General p. 99.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing a}} bitter {{series against the}} rival Rangers in the opening round of the 2008 NHL playoffs, Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery's hand. During game three of the series, in an unusual move, Avery <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Brodeur during a 5-on-3 power play, and began waving his hands and stick in front of Brodeur's face {{in an effort to}} {{distract}} him. The day after this game the NHL announced that it had revised its unsportsmanlike conduct rule, now known as The Sean Avery Rule, effectively outlawing such antics.|$|E
5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E

2500|$|Often, the batsman is {{only allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the next {{delivery}} if {{they hit the}} ball. If they miss and are not dismissed, they must attempt to play the next ball (which is bowled from where the ball ended up after the previous delivery) without being allowed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> it. Sometimes additionally, if the batsman does not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the ball before a fielder picks it up, they would have <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their waist and face the fielder bowling in order to hit the ball.|$|R

5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam, having {{consolidated}} {{his control}} over Baghdad, now <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> {{the threat posed}} by the Buyids. To this end, he strengthened his ties with the Baridis of Basra, by handing over Wasit, as previously agreed, appointing Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as vizier of the Abbasid court (although the latter remained at Wasit and did not visit Baghdad), and, finally, by marrying himself to one of al-Baridi's daughters. Bajkam's success against the Buyids was mixed: Wasit was saved from Buyid attack, and the Baridis led a successful campaign in Susiana, but an expedition into Jibal was crushed by the third Buyid brother, Hasan. The alliance with the Baridis quickly soured, however, as al-Baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing Bajkam, and ajkam was aware of this. In late August 940, Bajkam removed al-Baridi from the vizierate and launched an attack on Wasit, which the Baridis abandoned without resistance. In the meantime, the Baghdad was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace, with fanatical members of the Hanbali school imposing their tenets on the general populace.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.|$|E

5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} they knew what would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E

25|$|By default, {{the charge}} faces dexter (left {{as seen by}} the viewer); this would be forward on a shield worn on the left arm. In German armory, animate charges in the dexter half of a {{composite}} display are usually <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the center.|$|E

25|$|From around 1849 Darwin stopped {{attending}} church, but Emma and {{the children}} continued to attend services.

25|$|The Éolienne Bollée is {{an unusual}} wind turbine, unique for having a stator and a rotor, as a water turbine has. The eponymous {{invention}} was first patented in 1868 by Ernest Sylvain Bollée in France. A further patent dated 1885 differed mainly in two ways: First, in how the turbine was <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the wind and second, in an improvement which increased the flow of wind through the turbine was added. The turbines built according to the 1885 patent were commercially successful.|$|E

They bow as they step on the mat, then <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the Joseki and execute a ritsu rei (standing bow), then <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> each other and execute a zarei (kneeling bow). Tori and Uke step in, left foot first, to adopt shizen hontai (basic natural posture).|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} allow both range and bearing to be {{measured}} at the same time, separate antennas, receivers, amplifiers and displays were needed. The antennas were mounted on triangular trusses mounted rigidly to a wooden cabin, in turn mounted on an AA gun carriage bearing system which allowed the entire cabin to be rotated around the vertical axis. For tracking, the transmitter and receiver cabins were both <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> {{the general direction of}} the target. The result was an unwieldy system of some complexity.|$|E
25|$|When {{the statue}} of Moroni was installed, it faced {{southeast}} (as does the temple), but was shortly <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> due east {{at the request of}} church president David O.

In November 2005 the temple was closed for a seismic overhaul and a renovation of the baptistery, which had drainage and mildew problems. It reopened July 11, 2006, fifty years after the original dedication.|$|E
25|$|Darwin was on {{good terms}} with the local curate.
