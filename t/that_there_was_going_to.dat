25|$|In April 1907, high ranking Bolsheviks {{decided that}} Stalin and Kamo should {{organize}} a robbery in Tiflis to obtain funds to purchase arms. Through his connections, Stalin managed to discover {{from an old}} friend <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a large shipment of money by horse-drawn carriage to the Tiflis Bank on 26 June 1907.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 it {{had been}} {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> an off-Broadway revival of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, {{using some of the}} young stars of Broadway. The seven-member “Peanuts” gang featured Joshua Colley as Charlie Brown, Gregory Diaz as Schroeder, Aidan Gemme as Snoopy, Milly Shapiro as Sally, Mavis Simpson-Ernst as Lucy, and Jeremy T. Villas as Linus. Graydon Peter Yosowitz played the role of Charlie Brown from June 1-7. The show ran from May 24 – June 26, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The British had intercepted German {{communications}} {{coming from}} Washington and suspected <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be an attempt}} to land arms at Ireland, although they were not aware of the precise location. The arms ship, under Captain Karl Spindler, was apprehended by HMS Bluebell on the late afternoon of Good Friday. About to be escorted into Queenstown (present-day Cobh), County Cork on the morning of Saturday 22 April, Captain Spindler scuttled the ship by pre-set explosive charges. It now lies at a depth of 40 metres. Its surviving crew became prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|Thales, so {{the story}} goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of philosophy; but from his {{knowledge}} of astronomy he had observed {{while it was still}} winter <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a large crop of olives, so he raised a small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low rent as nobody was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a number of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for philosophers to be rich if they choose.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} for these manoeuvers was to {{encircle}} the city to cut off escape and overwhelm from both sides. If the situation deteriorated {{on one of the}} fronts or flanks, the leader from the hill directed one part of the army to support the other. If it appeared <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be significant loss, the Mongols would retreat to save their troops and would engage the next day, or the next month, after having studied the enemies' tactics and defences in the first battle, or again send a demand to surrender after inflicting some form of damage. There was no fixture on when or where units should be deployed: it was dependent on battle circumstances, and the flanks and groups had full authority on what to do in the course of battle - such as supporting other flanks or performing an individual feigned retreat as conditions seemed appropriate, in small groups of 100 to 1000 - so long as the battle unfolded according to the general directive and the opponents were defeated.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} public in early 2005 {{that the book}} would be published, representatives of Morrison {{contacted}} the publishers of the book. Said Rogan to The Irish Times: [...] "There has been contact with the publishers, I know that much. When the news broke {{earlier this year that}} the book was being published, his lawyers asked to see an advance copy of the manuscript. The publishers refused the request. But then {{this is a man who}} when he learnt <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a plaque erected outside his former Belfast home, got his solicitors to write to the Belfast Telegraph dissociating himself from the tribute." [...] The book was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg, and a 2006 edition was published by Vintage Books. Johnny Rogan appeared on a panel of experts in the 2008 documentary Van Morrison: Under Review 1964–1974, along with Steve Turner, author of the 1993 biography [...]|$|E

50|$|A {{sequential}} auction {{differs from}} a combinatorial auction, {{in which many}} items are auctioned simultaneously and the agents can bid on bundles of items. A sequential auction is much simpler to implement and more common in practice. However, the bidders in each auction know <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> future auctions, and this may affect their strategic considerations. Here are some examples.|$|R
500|$|Also on the event's card, the TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Ultimate X match, {{with the}} {{participants}} being the champion, Petey Williams, {{and the two}} challengers being, A.J. Styles and Chris Sabin. In an Ultimate X match, four pillars are set up at ringside with steel red ropes attached at the top, which are criss-crossed to form an [...] "X" [...] over {{the center of the}} ring. The championship belt is hung on the center [...] "X" [...] with the objective being to remove it and fall to the mat below to win. On the December 17 episode of Impact!, Rhodes announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an Ultimate X match at Final Resolution for the TNA X Division Championship. Styles and Williams were scheduled to be in the match after it was announced with Sabin being the only one having to earn the right to be in the match.

500|$|... 150 people protested at the Church of Scientology {{building}} in Sydney, Australia, carrying signs and wearing costumes. Participants were masked {{to maintain their}} anonymity and avoid possible retaliation from the Church of Scientology. Protesters chanted [...] "Church on the left, cult on the right" [...] (in reference to the Church that was beside the Church of Scientology building), [...] "Religion is free" [...] and [...] "We want Xenu". Scientology staff locked down the building {{and set up a}} camera to record the event. After the protest in Sydney, a surge in online Internet traffic due to individuals attempting to view pictures from the protest crashed hundreds of websites when a server was overloaded. The Sydney protest {{was one of the first}} worldwide, and after the first images of the protest went online a surge in traffic drove the hosting company's bandwidth usage up by 900 percent. The hosting company Digitalis temporarily prevented access to hundreds of its clients' sites, and customer support representative Denis Kukic said the surge was unexpected: [...] "We had no advance notice <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a sudden surge of traffic or that there would be more than 100 times the average traffic that this customer's website normally consumes." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{understood}} that Mayagüez {{was going to}} be the only city to ask to hold the games, so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be no need for a vote in the assembly held in Havana, Cuba in 2004.

500|$|Kahin, {{along with}} his {{graduate}} student Gareth Porter, was optimistic {{about the prospect of}} a takeover of Cambodia by the communist Khmer Rouge.

[...] He also spoke highly of the Khmer Rouge leadership, particularly Khieu Samphan, whom he called [...] "a very talented person." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 7 December 1965, Pope Paul VI {{issued the}} Motu Proprio Integrae servandae that reorganized the Holy Office as the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The Index was not listed {{as being a}} part of the newly {{constituted}} congregation's competence, leading to questioning whether it still was. This question was put to Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, pro-prefect of the congregation, who responded in the negative. [...] The Cardinal also indicated in his response <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a change in the Index soon.|$|E

60|$|The {{state of}} mind of the touring {{motorist}} entering a strange place at night is as peculiar and definite {{as that of a}} prospector. It is compounded of gratitude at having got safely in; of perception of a new town, yet with all eagerness about new things dulled by weariness; of hope <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a good hotel, but small expectation--and absolutely no probability--that <b>there</b> really will <b>be</b> one.|$|R
5000|$|On March 2, 2013, {{during the}} opening {{monologue}} on Saturday Night Live, Jay Pharoah parodied President Barack Obama giving a press conference about the recent budget cuts in Congress, saying <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> cuts on the military, social service workers, federal construction projects, and Native American funding.
