5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis (Genesis 30:3143), Jacob took every speckled and spotted sheep from his father-in-law's (Laban's) flock and bred them. Due to <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the animal described in Genesis, the Jacob sheep was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. <b>The</b> <b>resemblance</b> of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, {{the animal is}} not known to eat fish.

40|$|Kutenai is a {{language}} isolate spoken in southeastern British Columbia and adjacent areas in northern Idaho and northwestern Montana. It is {{immediately to the}} west of the westernmost Algonquian language, Blackfoot. The other languages adjacent to Kutenai are Interior Salish languages, including Shuswap and Kalispel. Although {{a language}} isolate, Kutenai bears a number of resemblances both to Algonquian languages and to Salish languages. The main thesis of this paper is that <b>the</b> <b>resemblances</b> of Kutenai to Algonquian are of a very different nature from <b>the</b> <b>resemblances</b> to Salish. In section 1 of this paper, I summarize some of <b>the</b> <b>resemblances</b> to Algonquian. There are roughly speaking two similarities. The first is that Kutenai has an obviation system that is strikingly similar to the obviation system of Algonquian languages. The second is that Kutenai has a set of words that I call preverbs that resemble preverbs in Algonquian in that they immediately precede the verb, they cover a range of meanings that are not commonly associated with a single word class in other languages, and they are preceded by a number of grammatical proclitics, including pronominal morphemes that code the person though not the number of the subject. 1 These resemblances involve quirky features, features that few other languages share. 2 <b>The</b> <b>resemblances</b> to Salish, in contrast, involve general typological features, like the presence of glottalized resonants and verb-subject word order, which are found in languages scattered around the world but which are particularly common, not only among Salish languages, but also among other languages in the Pacific Northwest, including Wakashan, Chimakuan, Tsimshian...|$|R
5|$|Prior to 1900, the {{similarity}} in {{shape of the}} shell of Amphidromus to that of South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had misled taxonomists. However, the dissections made by Wiegmann and Jacobi clearly showed that the inner anatomical features of Amphidromus {{were the same as}} those of the Asian-Indonesian Camaenidae, and that <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> of the shell of Amphidromus to that of bulimulids was merely an example of parallelism.|$|E
5|$|Several {{features}} of the tooth are only known {{from members of the}} family Dromaeosauridae of theropod dinosaurs. Dromaeosauroides was classified {{as a member of the}} Dromaeosaurinae subfamily within the Dromaeosauridae, due to its similarity to Dromaeosaurus. Despite <b>the</b> <b>resemblance,</b> Dromaeosauroides is not considered part of that genus. It is unlikely that a genus would survive for 60million years; Dromaeosauroides lived during the Early Cretaceous, and Dromaeosaurus during the Late Cretaceous. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. <b>The</b> <b>resemblance</b> is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E

5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E
5|$|In a 1980 article, Argentine {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia recognized <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> between Winge's Hesperomys molitor and Hershkovitz's Holochilus magnus, {{and recommended}} that the former be reclassified as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus molitor. When American zoologists Voss and Carleton restudied Winge's material in a 1993 paper, {{they were unable to}} find any consistent differences between the two and accordingly considered them to pertain to the same species. In addition, they reviewed the differences between this species and other Holochilus and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named Lundomys after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as Lundomys molitor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with cubeb, probably due to <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb, kumukus. This {{is seen as a}} curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else, since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. <b>The</b> <b>resemblance</b> between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of putlog holes, tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered {{to be the result of}} the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|E
5|$|The only secure {{depiction}} of the king dating to the Old Kingdom that has survived to this day is a rough, possibly unfinished, alabaster statuette showing Menkauhor enthroned and wearing the tight-fitting ceremonial robe of the Heb-sed. The statue was discovered in a cachette built during the late New Kingdom beneath {{the floor of a}} room {{to the west of the}} sacred lake at the temple of Ptah in Memphis. The Egyptologist Jocelyn Berlandini proposed that another statuette, usually attributed to Teti, belongs instead to Menkauhor Kaiu. Berlandini bases her hypothesis on stylistic grounds, noting <b>the</b> <b>resemblance</b> with Menkauhor's seated statue, as well as the location of the second statue, which was uncovered east of Teti's pyramid, in close proximity to Menkauhor's pyramid.|$|E
