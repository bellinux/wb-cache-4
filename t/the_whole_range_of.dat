5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E

25|$|The widespread, {{frequent}} use of acronyms across <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> registers {{is a relatively new}} linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century.

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records the first printed use of the word initialism as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after acronym had become common.|$|E
25|$|Further work on {{the system}} showed that the orbits {{proposed}} for the candidate planets were catastrophically unstable on timescales far shorter than {{the age of the}} system.

25|$|By one standard, no work created {{before the}} fantasy genre was defined can be {{considered}} to belong to it, {{no matter how many}} fantastic elements it includes.

Traditional works contain significant elements which modern fantasy authors have drawn upon extensively for inspiration in their own works.|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{effects of}} acyclovir, {{which is a}} purine nucleoside analogue and is known as an antibiotic substance, were examined on three lines of rat skin fibroblast FR cells; normal FR cells, FRtk^- cells which are deficient in the activity of thymidine kinase (tk) and FRtk^-HSVtk^+ cells which were prepared by introducing herpes simplex virus' tk gene to FRtk^- cells. When FRtk^-HSVtk^+ cells growing exponentially were incubated {{in the presence of}} acyclovir for 4 h, the surviving fractions of the cells decreased in a concertration-dependent manner. Whereas, decrease of the surviving fractions was almost indiscernible in both FR cells and FRtk^- cells at <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> drug-concentrations tested. These results indicate that acyclovir is phosphorylated by the herpes simplex virus' tk and becomes toxic to FRtk^-HSVtk^+ cells.
