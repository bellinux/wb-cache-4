40|$|The {{difficulty}} of decision - making by {{women who are}} widows compared to when they were wives was studied. The areas of decision-making that were rated as to difficult concerned family finance, child care, homemaking (family foods, clothing, home furnishings, and housing), social activities, and yard and car care. The sample consisted of 33 widows living in Logan, Utah during Spring Quarter, 1971. The subjects {{had at least one}} child living at home and had been widowed at least one year. The instruments used were: (l) a background questionnaire, and (2) a decision-making questionnaire. The statistical test used for analysis was the sign (binomial) test. Decisions concerning family finance, child care, cleaning and upkeep of the home, and yard care were more difficult for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>as</b> widows than such decisions had been for them as wives. Decisions concerning food, clothing, and home furnishings were not more difficult for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>as</b> widows. Decisions concerning washing the car were not more difficult, while decisions about maintenance, servicing, and repairs for the car were more difficult for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>as</b> widows. Decisions concerning social activities that are often done as individuals, not couples, were not more difficult for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>as</b> widows. Decisions concerning those social activities that couples often participate in were more difficult for <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>as</b> widows than such decisions had been for them as wives...|$|R

As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while driving her car, a woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting <b>the</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>As</b> she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck would have killed her.

As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able {{to walk away from}} the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E

5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine {{growing on the}} side of the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

After filling out a questionnaire from the Trump transition team, he realized the lapse and began the process of paying back taxes and fees.

A book is shown being turned upside down, and the direction of the video changes from moving downwards to upwards.
