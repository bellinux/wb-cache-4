5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main experience of skateboarding.|$|E
25|$|Oldcastle's {{religious}} beliefs were considerably influenced by Lollard cleric William Swynderby, who preached in Almeley during his youth. Lollardy was a politico-religious movement initiated by prominent theologian John Wycliffe in the 1370s during his {{service in the}} University of Oxford. Lollard beliefs were outlined in the 1395 The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards, which dealt with their opposition to capital punishment, rejection of religious celibacy, and belief {{that members of the}} Clergy should be held accountable to civil laws. The Conclusions also rejected pilgrimages, ornamentation of churches, and religious images because these were said to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> true nature of worship, focus on God. Also denounced in the Conclusions were war, violence, and abortion.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of AD 17, Germanicus returned to the capital and on May 26 he celebrated a triumph for his victories over the Germans. He had captured a few important prisoners, but Arminius was still at large. It was far from clear that Germanicus had won the war. Nonetheless, this did not <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> spectacle of his triumph: a near contemporary calendar marks 26 May as the day in [...] "which Germanicus Caesar was born into the city in triumph", while coins issued under his son Gaius (Caligula) depicted him on a triumphal chariot, with the reverse reading [...] "Standards Recovered. Germans Defeated." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Ahsan Haque of IGN {{rated the}} episode a 10/10, saying [...] "Overall, this episode easily ranks {{as one of}} the best episodes in the series.

Despite the fact that all of the events in the episode are revealed to be a dream, it doesn't <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> high degree of amusement provided." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number sixteen on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described it as [...] "classic bonkers Family Guy". He added that the episode was [...] "potentially the first time fans realised this wasn't just a Simpsons ripoff." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 10–11 UN peacekeepers were {{killed during the}} {{operation}} while 77 were wounded. This relatively low casualty rate greatly relieved Thant and his advisers. Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties are unknown. A total of seven UN fighter aircraft and a single reconnaissance aircraft were damaged by fire from the ground. In return, the Katangese Air Force had lost almost a dozen of its Harvards, Magisters, and de Havilland Vampires, most while on the ground. All Katangese combat aircraft, except {{for one or two}} Harvards, were recorded as destroyed by UN forces at the conclusion of Grandslam.

500|$|Spencer McIlvaine at Nintendo Life was {{disappointed}} {{in how the}} Wii version only had a single use for motion controls, and how low-resolution graphics from handheld versions of the game were used. Dan Whitehead at Eurogamer similarly thought that the motion controls were only a minor addition, and {{was disappointed}} in how little effort Capcom had put into the port compared to LucasArts' remake of The Secret of Monkey Island. Craig Harris at IGN called it [...] "incredibly lazy", wishing that it had included improved art and sharper text. Cara Ellison at Eurogamer called the Trilogy HD port [...] "perfunctory", saying that animations are slow at times, that the high-definition graphics <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> charm of the pixel art in previous versions, {{and that there is}} a delay after button presses.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} in their {{opinions}} on the gameplay; Roper said that [...] "simply see what's next" [...] was enjoyable, but acknowledged that the game's activities were limited beyond this aspect. Leadbetter went further, saying that Flow [...] "feels like a tech demo in many ways", and that its small amount of gameplay existed primarily [...] "to act as a tour guide" [...] through the visuals and audio. Freeman said that [...] "it would not be unfair to describe Flow as empty and without substance." [...] Navarro concluded that Flow was enjoyable for the few hours needed to complete it, but that it lacked [...] "a lasting gameplay experience"; he attributed this to the game's [...] "heavy emphasis on aesthetics over gameplay". Luke Mitchell of PALGN, however, felt that [...] "anything more complicated would <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> friendly nature of an experience of this type." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at his trial: [...] "How shall I put it — certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me". Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> meeting. Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for [...] "minutes" [...] as the [...] "Wannsee Protocol") were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting. Most of these copies were destroyed {{at the end of the}} war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner, a U.S. prosecutor in the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B, describing it as [...] "a well-paced murder mystery with an inventive wrap-up". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two positively critiqued the episode's [...] "character study" [...] of BJ Morrow, noting that it [...] "makes this episode stand out". Shearman and Pearson also complimented Strang's performance, writing that she [...] "seizes the part and gives it dignity." [...] However, the two were critical of the genetic defect, arguing that, because Strang's character is fleshed out, the reveal turns her into [...] "a puppet of the paranormal". Critical Myth reviewer John Keegan gave the episode a 7 out 10 rating and wrote that, [...] "Overall, this episode opens some interesting doors, adding the concept of genetic memory {{to the list of}} phenomena that cannot be explained in fully material terms. While the plot makes a certain amount of sense, {{there are a number of}} convenient moments that <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> whole. But the end result is a strong episode." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{effect this}} doctrine, the United States Army Air Corps would be {{required}} to expend the majority of its resources in amassing a fleet of self-defending heavy bombers, and in the training and maintenance of a great number of airmen to fill aircrew and ground crew positions. The ACTS officers who believed in the heavy bomber doctrine realized that any other Air Corps expenditures such as for tactical bombers and fighter aircraft would <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> proposed large fleet of heavy bombers. Moreover, the men realized that the United States government would have to reduce funding to naval and ground forces in order to establish a great air fleet. To implement these changes, the ACTS instructors began to instill a sense in their students that a separate and independent air arm of the type described earlier by Brigadier General William [...] "Billy" [...] Mitchell, to be called the United States Air Force, was the way forward. As a compromise first step, the General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force was established within the Army Air Corps in 1935, commanded by General Frank M. Andrews, a strategic bombing advocate. Andrews staffed the command with like-minded officers such as Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{reading the}} script, Kristin Kreuk noted {{that she had}} been [...] "entranced", believing that the main message that audiences would <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film was that of not judging an individual's {{personality}} based upon their physical appearances. Richardson thought that Caroline Thompson's adaptation was [...] "much more in keeping" [...] with the ethos of the Grimm tale than subsequent adaptations due to its [...] "darker" [...] nature. Praising Miranda Richardson as being perfect for the role of Elspeth, Caroline Thompson asserted {{that she had been}} [...] "a blast to work with." [...] Caroline Thompson noted that she cast the actors to play the dwarves according to their own individual personalities; she remarked that Warwick Davis was a [...] "phenomenal actor" [...] while Penny Blake was [...] "so funny" [...] and Michael J. Anderson was a [...] "genius." [...] Together, she thought that they brought an [...] "array of talents" [...] to the production. Michael J. Anderson himself claimed that he identified with his character, the [...] "philosopher of the group", and really enjoyed playing the role. Commenting on his character of Wednesday, Vincent Schiavelli noted that he was miserable because [...] "he really thinks that he's a dwarf" [...] even though he isn't.|$|E
500|$|... "Something There" [...] {{was written}} by lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken. According to Menken, [...] "Something There" [...] was written as [...] "a very quick replacement for ... 'Human Again'," [...] the latter of which was ultimately cut from Beauty and the Beast because it was considered [...] "too ambitious" [...] for the film. Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because [...] "We just couldn't {{figure out how to}} make it work and not <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central story of Belle." [...] Upon learning that [...] "Human Again" [...] was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return [...] "to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple," [...] the ultimate result of which was the love song [...] "Something There," [...] which has been described as [...] "shorter and more direct" [...] than [...] "Human Again". The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence near the end of the film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and [...] "as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work".|$|E

At the American Music Awards of 2004, West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer Gretchen Wilson. He later commented, [...] "I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year." [...] After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would [...] "really have a problem" [...] if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, [...] "I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt – you can never <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> amount of work I put into it.

500|$|In December 2011, Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat {{announced}} that Amy and Rory would {{leave in the}} seventh series in [...] "heartbreaking" [...] circumstances. Amy's exit was a mutual decision between Moffat and Gillan. Gillan stated {{that she wanted to}} go [...] "on a high when the character was at her prime" [...] and to [...] "go with everything that she wants". She wanted her character to have a final ending, and ruled out returning to the show in the future as she felt it would <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impact of her final scene. Moffat stated he felt [...] "tremendous pressure" [...] writing Amy and Rory's ending. He later revealed that he [...] "completely changed" [...] the ending as he was writing it, feeling the emphasis was wrong. During rewrites Moffat went back and forth deciding whether or not Amy and Rory should live or die. He eventually decided that death would complement the storyline involving the [...] "old, sentimental" [...] and [...] "dangerous" [...] characterisation of the Doctor. At one point he considered making the story that involved the Daleks, but felt the Weeping Angels were a [...] "better fit". Moffat was also interested in coming up with a new form for the Angels, and so he introduced the cherubs. He also said that since the Angels had debuted in [...] "Blink", fans had suggested that the Statue of Liberty could be a Weeping Angel.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} the overall theme, Sakaguchi said it was [...] "not enough to make 'life' the theme, you need to depict living and dying. In any event, you need to portray death". As a result of this, Nomura {{proposed}} {{the idea of having}} the heroine die. Originally, Aerith had been the only heroine, but her potential death {{led to the creation of}} Tifa. It was decided that Aerith was the one to die as her death would be the most devastating and consequential. Kitase wanted to depict it as very sudden and unexpected, leaving [...] "not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness", [...] "feelings of reality and not Hollywood". The script for the scene was written by Nojima. Kitase and Nojima then planned that most of the main cast would die shortly before the final battle, but Nomura successfully protested against the idea, thinking that it would <b>take</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impact of Aerith's death. Several character relations and statuses underwent changes during development. Aerith was originally going to be Sephiroth's sister, which influenced the design of Aerith's hair. To bring depth to Aerith's backstory, the team then made Sephiroth a previous love interest of hers, but later changed this to Zack being her former boyfriend. Both Vincent and Yuffie were originally intended to be part of the main narrative, but due to time constraints, they were nearly cut and eventually relegated to being optional characters.|$|E
