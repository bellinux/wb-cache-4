5|$|Parker was at {{home when}} the August 1896 term began, too sick to preside over the court, as he {{suffered}} from Bright's disease. The jurisdiction of the court {{came to an end}} on September 1, 1896, over lands in the Indian Territory; reporters wanted <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> about his career but had to talk to him at his bedside. Parker died on November 17, 1896, of a number of health conditions, including heart degeneration and Bright's disease. His funeral in Fort Smith had the highest number of attenders up to that point. He is buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Ryan went on {{to coach}} at three {{different}} colleges following his tenure with the Cardinals, though {{by the time he}} joined Kansas State in 1999, he was hopeful of a return to the NFL. Ryan received a call from newly named head coach Brian Billick of the Baltimore Ravens, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> for the defensive line coaching position. Having visited a class Ryan was teaching earlier in his career, Billick had been so impressed by Ryan's passion for the game of football that he decided to hire Ryan if he ever attained a head coaching position. When offered the position, Ryan accepted.|$|E

5000|$|Age of Opportunity: Lessons {{from the}} New Science of Adolescence, was {{published}} by Eamon Dolan/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in September 2014. While introducing Steinberg, prior <b>to</b> <b>interviewing</b> <b>him</b> about this book, for National Public Radio, Anya Kamenetz described how [...] "his testimony has contributed to Supreme Court decisions abolishing {{the death penalty for}} juveniles and life without parole for juvenile offenders." [...] Using Age of Opportunity as a starting point Wendy Leung, in the Globe and Mail credits Steinberg as [...] "redefining" [...] how we think about adolescence. Leung notes how Steinberg's study of “neuroplasticity” justifies considering adolescence continuing up until 25 years old, because individuals brains weren't fully formed at that age.|$|R
5|$|The premier night fighter aces in the RAF—Cunningham, Braham and Branse Burbridge—did not {{appreciate}} press attention. In {{the case of}} Cunningham and Burbridge, this may have stemmed from deeper religious convictions about combat and killing. Burbridge became a priest {{during the war and}} both he and Cunningham did not cooperate with biographers when approached to have their exploits described in print after the war. During the war, Braham also actively shunned the lime-light. One of the country's best-selling newspapers, the Daily Express, asked <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> but he declined. Much to Braham's embarrassment, his father gave interviews about his then famous son in 1943. When no stories were forthcoming, the newspapers soon lost interest. Braham and Cunningham were certainly aware of each other {{as a result of the}} press attention, and a competitive rivalry developed. In his book Scramble, Braham mentioned with pride the night he surpassed Cunningham's score permanently.|$|E

25|$|The {{incident}} has reminded {{people of}} Conservative tactics during the 2006 election, where {{attempts by the}} media to speak with local candidates were stopped by campaign personnel, especially the Harold Albrecht incident, where campaign officials forced Albrecht {{to stay in a}} restaurant kitchen when journalists attempted <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

Noted for his passions {{for such things as}} U.S. politics (he took time off work to cheer on Barack Obama in that country's 2008 presidential election), Inspector Morse box sets (the lead character of which he described as [...] "the morose and melancholic opera lover who deals with an inordinate amount of bloodshed in Oxford"), [...] "real turf, the John Hinde donkey post card kind" [...] and buying out-of-print history books on Amazon.com—appearing on Seoige and O'Shea in April 2008, he proclaimed his top three books of the previous year as The Road by Cormac McCarthy, Christine Falls by Benjamin Black and Exit Ghost by Philip Roth. He is fond of the humour of Gerry Ryan and the fictional character Ross O'Carroll-Kelly.|$|R
25|$|In the 1952 VFL season, Bland made 12 {{appearances}} for St Kilda, all {{in succession}} from rounds 4 to 15.

25|$|Home Box Office (HBO) wanted <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> for {{a feature}} length {{documentary}} on the college basketball scandal of 1951 called , but he refused.

25|$|In {{the episode}} , serial killer Mark Ford Brady (Roy Scheider), anxious to delay his {{scheduled}} execution, arranges for Goren and Eames <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> about victims not yet attributed to him.

40|$|Scott Brookie {{was interviewed}} on August 27, 2002 at UCSC, at Scotty's Santa Cruz home. Scotty and I {{sat at his}} kitchen table, drank apple juice and talked for a couple hours. It was a relaxed and, at times, quite {{entertaining}} interview. Despite working on the same campus for a year, I didn't know Scotty prior <b>to</b> <b>interviewing</b> <b>him.</b> I {{had worked for the}} past year as the Program Coordinator at UCSC's GLBT Center, but our paths had not crossed. Before coming to UCSC, I worked as a freelance writer, a counselor, and an interviewer on AIDS studies, so I was comfortable turning on a tape recorder and asking him lots of questions. Scotty seemed to enjoy the process as well. He was generous with his time and his work: I left that night with an armload of Lavender Readers that he retrieved from a back closet. They are a treasure I have since passed on to the GLBT Cente...|$|R

25|$|Lucas is {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his activism and outspokenness. His criticism of drug use and his sponsorship of public service ad campaigns {{about the dangers of}} unprotected sex in the gay community led Harvey Fierstein <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> for The Advocate. His New York Blade columns on Ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Islam sparked a campus debate at Stanford University in February 2008 when Lucas was invited to give a speech to students.

25|$|In 1807, Jewitt {{published}} his Journal Kept at Nootka Sound. The interest generated by this journal prompted Richard Alsop <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> extensively. This material, combined with his earlier and more terse Journal, {{culminated in the}} 1815 publication of A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of {{the crew of the}} ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives. Very little of the Journal is left out of the Narrative—e.g. the episode (28 March 1804) of an accidental fatal shooting by a father of his children. The main difference is that in the former Jewitt refers to Maquinna as a chief, and in the latter as a king.|$|E
60|$|Neale {{left the}} office and, {{returning}} to Henney, repeated the <b>interview</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> word for word. Henney complimented Neale's spirit, but deplored the incident.

[...] Berman asked what the endorsement would cost, to which Gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode. [...] Berman agreed. Gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to Back to the Future Part II (1989) and later said that he would have gone in a different direction had he written the story. [...] Nonetheless, he felt the final product ended up being better than anything he would have created.|$|E
5000|$|Three more Bumfights volumes were created, however McPherson and {{his team}} were not {{responsible}} for these, but instead two investors, who went by the pseudonyms Ray Latticia and Ty Beeson, purchased the rights to Bumfights. McPherson stated {{in an interview that}} they were [...] "extorting us and doing a bunch of shady shit, so we sold off our rights." [...] Ty Beeson was seen on TV as arrogant and cocky in an attempt to increase sales even more. Beeson appeared on an episode of Dr. Phil, in which he shaved his hair and dressed identically to Dr. Phil who was meant <b>to</b> be <b>interviewing</b> <b>him,</b> however, Dr. Phil cut the interview short after seeing an intro segment in which Beeson bragged about the little amount he paid the homeless and the millions that he made from them.|$|R
5000|$|Sir John Leahy {{was invited}} {{as a guest}} speaker by the School of International Studies (SIS) at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA. Marjorie Chase, International Editor for the Pacifican {{newspaper}} (1990-1991) took the rare opportunity <b>to</b> personally <b>interview</b> <b>him.</b> She published a brief article {{about him in the}} Pacifican. Regarding the interview, she states, [...] "I found him to have been a fascinating man, fully professional, but quite down to earth." [...] As Miss Chase was also educated at a British institution of higher learning (Worcester College, Oxford), she enjoyed sharing an inside understanding of Britain's unique culture. At the time of the interview, Chase was pursuing a degree at U.O.P. in International Affairs and Commerce and was quite involved in news coverage of Middle East affairs of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and other Middle East countries (especially as his visit was {{during the height of the}} Iraq/Kuwait invasion), so she considered this <b>interview</b> <b>to</b> be an exclusive privilege.|$|R

Campbell Brown attributed the Flowers ad to David Bossie rather than Floyd Brown, prompting Citizens United to threaten a lawsuit, and to distinguish between its activities, and those of Floyd Brown, the [...] "true" [...] author of the Flowers ad.|$|R

Over lunch Moelia falls in love with the priest's daughter, Retna Sari. He learns that she must marry a man of equal standing to her father, one who is [...] "no less than the Sultan of Yogyakarta or the Sunan of Solo". Upon returning home, Moelia realises that Noesa Brama must be the last male descendent of the Hindu kings of Pajajaran, and that both Retna Sari and her mother bear a striking resemblance to his own grandmother. Several days later, he returns to the mountain and overhears a group of men from Palembang planning to kidnap Retna Sari. He chases them away, then briefly visits Noesa Brama before returning home. Though he attempts to forget Retna Sari, he is unable to do so.|$|E

Gautham surrenders to the police after [...] "killing" [...] the man, confessing that he killed three men: one in Belfast, one in Pune and one just now in Hyderabad. He is released from custody after Sameera broadcasts the video on television. According to his doctor, if Gautham can hallucinate a person other than the three men, he can be treated. Gautham goes to Goa on vacation. Sameera stalks him, convincing him that two people are stalking him: a journalist who wants <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> (imaginary), and a person claiming to be his fan (real). Gautham begins {{to fall in love with}} Sameera.

By the time he learns about Sameera's intentions, she has left for Hyderabad; Gautham pursues her.|$|E
500|$|In July 1933, Gernsback {{dismissed}} Lasser as editor. Lasser {{had become}} active in promoting workers' rights and was spending less {{time on his}} editorial duties. According to Lasser, Gernsback told him [...] "if you like working with the unemployed so much, I suggest you go and join them". It is likely that cost-cutting was also a consideration, as Lasser was paid $65 per week, a substantial salary in those days. Soon after Lasser was let go, Gernsback received a fanzine, The Fantasy Fan, from a reader, Charles Hornig. Gernsback called Hornig to his office <b>to</b> <b>interview</b> <b>him</b> for the position of editor; Hornig {{turned out to be}} only17, but Gernsback asked him to proofread a manuscript and decided that the results were satisfactory. Hornig was hired at an initial salary of $20 per week. That same year, Gernsback dissolved Stellar Publications and created Continental Publications as the new publisher for Wonder Stories. The schedule stuttered for the first time, missing the July and September 1933 issues; the recent bankruptcy of the company's distributor, Eastern Distributing Corporation, may have been partly responsible for this disruption. The first issue with Continental on the masthead, and the first listing Hornig as editor, was November 1933.|$|E
