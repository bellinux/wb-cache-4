25|$|In {{the latter}} part of 1330 the Emperor went in person to perform the great {{sacrifice}} to the sky, which was done by deputy. This was followed by a general amnesty, and by the proclamation of his young son Aratnadara as heir apparent in January 1331. Tugh Temür's consort Budashiri, having a grudge against Babusha, the widow of Kusala, had her assassinated by an eunuch. Then she sent Kusala's son Toghon Temür in exile to Korea to secure her son's succession; but Aratnadara died one month after his designation as heir. This sudden death of his son completely upset Tugh Temür's plan for succession. Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür caused his another son, Gunadara (Kulatana), to live with El Temur and recognize him as his father, and changed his name to El <b>Tegus.</b>|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the {{bureaucracy}} was dominated by El Temür, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the empire, the actual impact of the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature on the government as a whole was limited. El Temür eventually seized control of the academy in early 1332, just six months before the death of Tugh Temür. The academy had come to an end after Tugh Temür's death. Although El <b>Tegüs</b> was still alive, on his deathbed Tugh Temür expressed remorse for what he had done to his elder brother, Kusala, and his intention to pass the throne to Toghon Temür. After Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür died on 2 September 1332, Kuśala's second son Rinchinbal was installed by El Temür only at the age of six because Toghon Temür was far away from the central government.|$|E

The grand councilor El Temür resisted letting Kuśala's eldest son Toghun Temür accede to the throne since he was suspected of having poisoned his father Kuśala. When Tugh Temur's widow and El Tegüs's mother Budashiri Khatun respected Tugh Temür's will of making Kuśala's son succeed the throne, the 6 year old Rinchinbal was chosen. While Toghun Temür was kept far away from the capital Dadu, Rinchinbal was in Dadu and had become favored by Tugh Temür. Rinchinbal was enthroned as the new emperor on October 23, 1332, but he died on December 14.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "sprawling" [...] posture is {{the most}} primitive, and is the {{original}} limb posture from which the others evolved. The upper limbs are typically held horizontally, while the lower limbs are vertical, though upper limb angle may be substantially increased in large animals. [...] The body may drag along the ground, as in salamanders, or may be substantially elevated, as in monitor lizards. [...] This posture is typically associated with trotting gaits, and the body flexes from side-to-side during movement to increase step length. [...] All limbed reptiles and salamanders use this posture, as does the platypus and several species of frogs that walk. Unusual examples can be found among amphibious fish, such as the mudskipper, which drag themselves across land on their sturdy fins. [...] Among the invertebrates, most arthropodswhich includes the most diverse group of animals, the insectshave a stance best described as sprawling. There is also anecdotal evidence that some octopus species (such as the Pinnoctopus genus) can also drag themselves across land a short distance by hauling their body along by their tentacles (for example to pursue prey between rockpools) - there may be video evidence of this. The semi-erect posture is more accurately interpreted as an extremely elevated sprawling posture.

50|$|<b>Tegus</b> are omnivorous, {{foraging}} for a {{wide range}} of foods using their forked tongues, including fruit, fungi, various arthropods, small vertebrates, carrion, and eggs. The amount of meat that is consumed by <b>tegus</b> decreases as the animals mature. As adults, <b>tegus</b> have few predators. Among them are big cats, birds of prey and large snakes. <b>Tegus</b> defend themselves using their powerful jaws, which can exert forces of up to 1000N.

50|$|Within {{their native}} range, <b>tegus</b> are {{often thought of}} as pests, {{sometimes}} raiding chicken coops to feed on the eggs or fowl.

When Nemorat conquers Assyria, Shila is brought to the Egyptian court; and, at the instigation of Nemorat's mother, marries the pharaoh. The pharaoh, who is a mentally disturbed hypochondriac, has a good and wise physician, Resi, who falls in love with Shila, and encourages her to go on living despite the killing of her Assyrian surrogate parents by <b>Tegi.</b> When Shila spurns an amorous Nemorat one evening, he goes into a violent rage causing him to faint. He is then poisoned by his ambitious chief overseer Kefren and his mistress. Shila is convicted of the murder and is sentenced to be buried alive with Nemorat. Resi comes {{up with a plan to}} save Shila by having her take a drug, which causes her to lapse into a temporary coma, while he bribes the chief of the [...] "house of death" [...] to allow him to take Shila away in the dead of night. The chief of the house of death proves treacherous by not allowing Resi to rescue Shila, but in a struggle with Resi he is killed. Resi, though, is seriously wounded and is rescued and tended by his faithful servant, but he does not recover before Shila is entombed with Pharaoh Nemorat. The common people, who have benefited from Resi's kind care of them, aid him in capturing the royal architect, who helps Resi and his associates, greedy tomb robbers, to break into Nemorat's tomb and save Shila.
