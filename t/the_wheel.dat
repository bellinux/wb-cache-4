5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> in two.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are poor}} at dealing with {{vertical}} obstacles, especially obstacles {{on the same}} scale as <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself, and {{may be unable to}} climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> height. Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.|$|E

50|$|The {{steering}} ratio is {{the ratio of}} the number of degrees of turn of <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> to <b>the</b> number of degrees <b>the</b> <b>wheel(s)</b> turn as a result. In motorcycles, delta tricycles and bicycles, the {{steering ratio}} is always 1:1, because <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> is fixed to <b>the</b> front <b>wheel.</b> A steering ratio of x:y means that a turn of <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> x degree(s) causes <b>the</b> <b>wheel(s)</b> to turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel,</b> 360 degrees, causes <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> to turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1.|$|R
50|$|Above <b>the</b> big <b>wheel,</b> <b>the</b> count <b>wheel</b> {{is mounted}} {{on the front of}} the clock outside the clock frame. <b>The</b> count <b>wheel</b> has 78 teeth on the outside, and the 12 notches are on the inside of <b>the</b> count <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> main arbor has an 8-tooth pinion which drives <b>the</b> count <b>wheel.</b> This {{directly}} reflects the ratio of strikes to lifting pins on <b>the</b> main <b>wheel,</b> as each turn of <b>the</b> count <b>wheel</b> has to produce 78 strikes (the total of numbers 1 through 12). One turn of <b>the</b> count <b>wheel</b> is equal to 9¾ turns of <b>the</b> big <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|In rail vehicles, the {{wheelbase}} {{follows a}} similar concept. However, since <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> {{may be of}} different sizes (for example, on a steam locomotive), the measurement is taken between the points where <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> contact <b>the</b> rail, and not between the centers of <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio means that <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> is turned {{more to get}} <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel.</b> A lower {{steering ratio}} means that <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> turning, but it will be harder to turn <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn <b>the</b> steering <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. <b>The</b> steering <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R
5|$|Soul Reaver {{takes place}} within the fictional world of Nosgoth, where {{the health of the}} land is tied to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and each pillar in turn is {{represented}} by a guardian. Before the events of Soul Reaver, the guardians became corrupt, and, after Kain killed eight of them, he discovered he was the final one. Refusing to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars, he doomed Nosgoth to eternal decay and proceeded to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to besiege the land. By the time of Soul Reavers introduction, the vampires are now the land's dominant species and apex predators, the humans have been decimated, and the vampire tribes have each claimed a region of Nosgoth and turned their attention to internal matters. Unknown to the vampires, beneath Nosgoth lurks The Elder God, an ancient and powerful entity. The Elder God controls <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> of Fate, a cycle of reincarnation of souls that circle <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> in a loop of predestination; however, because vampires are immortal, their souls do not spin with <b>the</b> <b>Wheel,</b> causing the land to decay as <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> stalls. By the time that Raziel is revived centuries after the game's opening cinematic, Nosgoth is on the brink of collapse, little more than a wasteland wracked with cataclysms and earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. <b>The</b> <b>wheel,</b> allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> calculate the friction between <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The major {{difference}} {{was in the}} brake rods of which there were two inboard of <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> earlier SO and 562 locomotives had four pull-rods, the outer ones being outside of <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> to one side. The restoring {{force is applied}} in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E

5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{changing}} load as <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> rotates in alternating directions, some sections experience total stress reversals. In order to avoid fatigue {{that could lead to}} cracks, sections were bolted rather than welded, using over 14,000 bolts and 45,000 bolt holes.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and the distance between <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

5000|$|The Soviet Union used a {{different}} solution to hammer blow with their 2-10-4 locomotive design. The cylinders were placed above the centre driving axle. Unlike nearly all steam locomotives, the pistons had rods {{on both ends}} which transferred power to <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> idea was to balance the driving forces on <b>the</b> <b>wheels,</b> allowing <b>the</b> counterweights on <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> to be smaller and reducing [...] "hammer blow" [...] on the track.|$|R
50|$|The Gyromax balance has six {{to eight}} small {{turnable}} weights that fit on pins located in recesses {{around the top of}} <b>the</b> balance <b>wheel</b> rim. Each of the weights, called collets, has a cutout making it heavier on one side. When the collet's cutout points to the outside of <b>the</b> balance <b>wheel,</b> <b>the</b> heavier side is toward the center which decreases <b>the</b> <b>wheel's</b> moment of inertia, increasing its speed. When the collet's cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and <b>the</b> balance <b>wheel</b> turns more slowly. A watchmaker can turn an individual collet to adjust <b>the</b> <b>wheel's</b> balance, referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing collets to adjust <b>the</b> <b>wheel's</b> rotation speed. <b>The</b> Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on <b>the</b> <b>wheel's</b> balance spring for adjusting the watch's rate, so the collets are used for adjusting both poise and rate.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> left <b>wheel</b> were to {{move forward}} one unit while <b>the</b> right <b>wheel</b> {{remained}} stationary, then <b>the</b> right <b>wheel</b> acts as a pivot, and <b>the</b> left <b>wheel</b> traces a circular arc in the clockwise direction. Since one's unit of distance is usually quite small, one can approximate by assuming that this arc is a line. Thus, the original position of <b>the</b> left <b>wheel,</b> <b>the</b> final position of <b>the</b> left <b>wheel,</b> and <b>the</b> position of <b>the</b> right <b>wheel</b> form a triangle, which one can call A.|$|R
