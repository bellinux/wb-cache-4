50|$|In 1917, the South African {{mandatory}} {{administration had}} created a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>dogs,</b> and increased it in 1921. The tax {{was rejected by the}} Bondelswarts, a group of Khoikhoi, who were opposed to various policies of the new administration. They were also protecting five men for whom arrest warrants had been issued.|$|E
50|$|The most {{successful}} {{of these was}} Der Steuersong (en: The Tax Song), which reached the number one spot in Germany and Austria in 2002, and went double platinum in 2004, having sold over an million copies. Based on Las Ketchup's summer dance hit Aserejé, the song lampooned Schröder's tax policy, listing a number of perceived absurd indirect taxes (such as an <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>dogs)</b> and suggesting new ones on breathing and bad weather, and depicting the Chancellor as a cheat and an promise breaker. The song {{was accompanied by a}} video, in which an unflattering Spitting Image style puppet of Schröder stole coins from a charity collection tin, and medicine from the sick.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>dog</b> owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|R
50|$|Dogs {{were used}} as draught animals to pull small carts for farms, peddlers, or {{travellers}} (milk, fish, rags & bones, meat, bread, and other products), to deliver mail, and to pull carts carrying people for transportation or entertainment. They were used in World War I to pull small field guns. Dogs in harness sometimes had guard dogs {{to protect them from}} stray dogs. In 1839, a ban <b>on</b> draught <b>dogs</b> in London and a later ban <b>on</b> all draught <b>dogs</b> and a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> other working <b>dogs</b> caused the deaths of over 150,000 dogs, who were replaced in their work by children and adults.|$|R
25|$|Soon coffee {{became the}} primary {{commodity}} export of Sri Lanka. Falling coffee prices {{as a result}} of the depression of 1847 stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> firearms, <b>dogs,</b> shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of rajakariya, requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent. These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and another rebellion broke out in 1848. A devastating leaf disease, Hemileia vastatrix, struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years. The British quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead. Tea production in Sri Lanka thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} tax on {{immovable}} property {{and local taxes}} in Cesky Krumlov, Jindrichuv Hradec, Prachatice a Strakonice. The main objective is to evaluate the development of tax income from real estate tax and selected local taxes. Work identifies the reasons for significant changes between these revenues in the years 2002 - 2015. The greatest differences in revenues of tax on immovable assets in the years 2002 - 2015 were caused by two major changes in this tax. Specifically, the Law no. 261 / 2007 Coll., which introduced the possibility to provide the local coefficient of 2, 3, 4 or 5, and thus significantly increase its revenues and the city budget. The most local municipalities have begun to apply the coefficients since 2009. Another significant intervention {{in the real estate}} tax was Law no. 362 / 2009, which doubled tax rates, with effect from January 1 st, 2010. The most noticeable growth in the revenues from local <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>dogs</b> appeared between 2003 and 2004, when the city increased local tax rate of dogs because the Law no. 229 / 2003 Coll., changed maximum tax rate from CZK 1, 000 to CZK 1, 500. The most significant change in local taxes on waste brought Law no. 174 / 2012 Coll., which doubled the maximum rate, with effect from January 1 st, 2013. But the municipalities were not affected by this change because the cities kept the level of rates to the level of previous years...|$|E

50|$|The St. John's dog {{was made}} extinct in its {{homeland}} {{by a combination}} of two factors. In an attempt to encourage sheep raising, heavy restrictions and <b>taxes</b> were placed <b>on</b> <b>dog</b> ownership during the 19th century. Also their main overseas destination, the UK, imposed rigorous long-term quarantine on all imported animals, especially dogs (1885) as part of the eradication of rabies.

60|$|The {{difficulties}} of a fair income-tax have elicited a proposition for a direct tax {{of so much}} per cent, not on income but on expenditure; the aggregate amount of each person’s expenditure being ascertained {{as the amount of}} income now is, from statements furnished by the contributors themselves. The only security would still be the veracity of individuals, {{and there is no reason}} for supposing that their statements would be more trustworthy on the subject of their expenses than on that of their revenues. The <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> expenditure at present in force, either in this or in other countries, fall only on particular kinds of expenditure, and differ no otherwise from <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> commodities than in being paid directly by the person who consumes or uses the article, instead of being advanced by the producer or seller, and reimbursed in the price. The <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> horses and carriages, <b>on</b> <b>dogs,</b> <b>on</b> servants, are of this nature. They evidently fall on the persons from whom they are levied—those who use the commodity taxed. A tax of a similar description, and more important, is a house-tax, which must be considered at somewhat greater length.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we make an {{analysis}} of the major aspects concerning the budgets of the EU countries. On this paper we focus <b>on</b> the main <b>taxes</b> of the 27 EU countries.

Current <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income are made up of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income and other current <b>taxes.</b> <b>Taxes</b> <b>on</b> income consist of <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> personal income and the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the revenue or profit of companies. Indirect taxes consist of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and imports, which in turn are composed of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and other <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production. The <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production consist of: Value Added <b>Tax,</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> imports excluding VAT and <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production excluding VAT and duties.
