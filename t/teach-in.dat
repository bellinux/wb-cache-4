5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{the city}} gained a {{reputation}} as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, {{as well as the}} student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. <b>teach-in</b> against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.|$|E

Students, faculty, and other activists involved in the <b>teach-ins</b> {{would go on to}} organize other antiwar protests, including the 20,000-person rally at the Washington Monument in April 1965. <b>Teach-ins</b> have continued through the decades since 1965 in response to other national crises, including climate change.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s activists began a {{new series}} of <b>teach-ins</b> focused on the corporatization of {{education}} and on corporate power generally. These began under the name of the 'National <b>Teach-Ins</b> on Corporations, Education, and Democracy' in 1996 and continued on as the 'Democracy Teach-Ins' (DTIs) of 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2002. Leading activist and intellectual figures of the 1990s, including Cornel West, Medea Benjamin, Richard Grossman, Naomi Klein, and Vandana Shiva spoke at the Democracy <b>Teach-Ins,</b> which were coordinated in their first years by Ben Manski. The Democracy <b>Teach-ins</b> were coordinated on hundreds of campuses at once, and were intended to build campus-based networks of pro-democracy activists. The 1999 Democracy <b>Teach-Ins,</b> in particular, played a role in mobilizing students for the 1999 Seattle WTO protests; the 2002 <b>teach-ins</b> played a similar role in preparing for the 2003 national Books Not Bombs student strike. After 1998, the DTIs became a project of the campus syndicalist movement 180/Movement for Democracy and Education.|$|R

Later, he co-wrote The United States in Vietnam [...] with Stanford {{professor}} John Lewis, a publication which helped to turn people in academia against U.S. intervention in Vietnam.

500|$|On April 19, 1969, Cornell's Afro-American Society {{occupied}} the Willard Straight Hall student union in protest against [...] "the university's racist attitudes and irrelevant curriculum" [...] regarding racial issues. The university was divided between {{proponents of the}} inclusion of the principles of social justice in course instruction and advocates of academic freedom for the faculty. This clash affected the Department of Government, where Kahin and a number of professors defending academic freedom resided. Many of these professors had considered leaving the university due to the administration's policies promoting racial justice, and many did following the end of the occupation. The following week, the Department of Government organized a <b>teach-in</b> on academic freedom, and Kahin was invited to speak at the event by department chair Peter Sharfman. Historian Walter LaFeber would later remember his remarks as [...] "the most eloquent speech about academic freedom I have ever encountered anywhere up to that time or since that time".|$|E

500|$|ED Denson, the {{co-publisher}} of Rag Baby, introduced McDonald to Chris Strachwitz, {{who owned}} Arhoolie Recording Studios, to self-produce the EP. Sensing the band's potential, Denson assumed management control, and {{was responsible for}} coining the group's name—a reference to Josef Stalin and to Mao Zedong's description of revolutionaries as [...] "the fish who swim {{in the sea of}} the people". McDonald, who had recording experience, began utilizing Arhoolie Recording Studios to record four songs split equally between the band and a local folk musician, Peter Krug. It was during this time at Arhoolie Records that Country Joe and the Fish's folk sound and political protest prowess—an amalgam of their own Guthrie-influenced material and their folk music roots—began to emerge. The band's side of the EP featured two originals by McDonald, an acoustic version of [...] "I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag" [...] (also known as [...] "The Fish Cheer"), and [...] "Superbird". According to McDonald, [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was written in 30 minutes, with a purpose of expressing satiric and dark commentary on the US's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. In October 1965, 100 copies of the EP, titled Rag Baby Talking Issue No. 1, were distributed on McDonald's independent label at a <b>Teach-in</b> in UC Berkeley and underground shops selling Rag Baby magazine.|$|E

On October 11, 1968, Dohrn suggested she would expand the movement to non-students and do all that was necessary to complete the job of [...] "attack, expose, destroy." [...] Dohrn continued to give speeches on behalf of SDS and Weather Underground and attend leadership conferences for both organizations. On January 29 and 30, 1969, in recognition of the tenth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, the University of Washington held a Cuba <b>teach-in</b> where Dohrn was a speaker on campus.

2500|$|Along {{with his}} writings, Chomsky also became {{actively}} involved in left-wing activism. Refusing to pay half his taxes, he publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested for being part of an anti-war <b>teach-in</b> outside the Pentagon. During this time, Chomsky, along with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald, also founded the anti-war collective RESIST. Although he questioned {{the objectives of the}} 1968 student protests, he gave many lectures to student activist groups; furthermore, he and his colleague Louis Kampf began running undergraduate courses on politics at MIT, independently of the conservative-dominated political science department. During this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam and, as Chomsky says, [...] "a good deal of [...] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus". As Chomsky elaborates, [...] " [...] about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was {{right in the middle of}} it. I was in a military lab... the Research Laboratory for Electronics." [...] By 1969, student activists were actively campaigning [...] "to stop the war research" [...] at MIT. Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but he also thought it best to keep such research on campus and he proposed that it should be restricted to what he called [...] "systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character". During this period, MIT had six of its anti-war student activists sentenced to prison terms. Chomsky says MIT's students suffered things that [...] "should not have happened", though he has also described MIT as [...] "the freest and the most honest and has the best relations between faculty and students than at any other... quite a good record on civil liberties". In 1970 he visited the Vietnamese city of Hanoi to give a lecture at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology; on this trip he also toured Laos to visit the refugee camps created by the war, and in 1973 he was among those leading a committee to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the War Resisters League.|$|E
