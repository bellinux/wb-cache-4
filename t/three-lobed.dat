5|$|The {{sycamore}} may hybridise {{with other}} species in Acer section Acer, including with A. heldreichii where their natural ranges overlap and with A.velutinum. Intersectional hybrids with A. griseum (Acer section Trifoliata) are also known, {{in which the}} basal lobes of the leaf are reduced in size, making the leaves appear almost <b>three-lobed</b> (trifoliate).|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a <b>three-lobed</b> posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The leopard {{catshark}} is {{the smaller}} and slimmer {{of the two}} Poroderma species. The head and snout are short and slightly flattened, with a somewhat pointed snout tip. Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a <b>three-lobed</b> flap of skin in front, of which the central lobe forms a slender barbel that reaches past the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and placed rather high on the head, with a thick ridge running under each. The mouth is wide and arched, with short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1830 and 1326 tooth rows {{on either side of}} the upper and lower jaws respectively. The teeth have a narrow central cusp with a pair of small lateral cusplets; those of adult males are slightly more curved than those of females.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a <b>three-lobed</b> stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
25|$|P. alpina only begins {{flowering}} {{after several}} years of growth. Six to eight (occasionally up to 13) flowers are borne singly on unbranched inflorescences up to 12cm (5in) tall. The zygomorphic flowers are 10–16mm (⅜-⅝in) long with a short yellow-green spur and are composed of a two-lobed upper lip and <b>three-lobed</b> lower lip. They are white with one or sometimes three yellow markings on the lower lip. These can be variable in size and shape. The flowers are protogynous, meaning that the female stigmas mature before the male anthers, and are pollinated by flies.|$|E
25|$|Passiflora tarminiana {{is a high}} {{climbing}} vine with hairy {{stems and}} petioles. Where the petioles join the stem it has stipules which are 4–7 by 2–3mm and are soon deciduous. The leaves are <b>three-lobed</b> and hairy below but usually hairless above. The flowers are solitary and hang downwards. The base of the flower has pale green bracts enclosing a swollen nectary chamber. The floral tube (hypanthium) is 6–8 × 0.7–1cm and pale green, while the sepals and petals are 3–6cm long, pink and perpendicular to the floral tube, or reflexed. Fruits taper at both ends, are 10–14cm long by 3.5–4.5cm wide and ripen to yellow or light orange. The fruit contain many seeds which are embedded in an edible, orange aril.|$|E
25|$|The {{wall of the}} mihrab {{is covered}} with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have {{a wide variety of}} plant and {{geometric}} patterns including the stylized grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed vine leaves, <b>three-lobed</b> florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|E
500|$|The pyjama shark is {{the larger}} and thicker-bodied {{of the two}} Poroderma species, growing to [...] long and [...] or more in weight. Both sexes grow to roughly the same maximum size. The head and snout are short and {{slightly}} flattened, with a narrowly parabolic outline when viewed from above or below. Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a flap of skin in front; the flap has a <b>three-lobed</b> shape with the central lobe forming a long, conical barbel. The barbels are thicker than in the leopard catshark, and do not reach the mouth. The eyes are horizontally oval and placed rather high on the head, with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and a thick ridge running underneath. The sizable mouth forms a broad arch, with short furrows extending from the corners onto both {{the upper and lower}} jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1825 and 1424 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively. The teeth have a slender central cusp flanked by a pair of small cusplets; those of adult males are slightly thicker than those of females.|$|E
500|$|The {{diversity}} of characteristics complicates description of Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance (see Evolution). The Liliaceae family are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous {{in the case}} of Medeoleae) flowering plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of [...] "petals", that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is superior, i.e. placed above the attachment of the other parts. There are three fused carpels (syncarpous) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a <b>three-lobed</b> stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind-dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was known as}} the Golden Arrow, partly in reference to its colour, the distinctive <b>three-lobed</b> cowling of the 'broad-arrow' [...] Napier Lion engine, but also to another contemporary Lion-powered record-breaker, Henry Segrave's [...] Golden Arrow land speed record car.|$|E
2500|$|The {{banknote}} {{designs were}} criticised by Keith Rushton, {{chairman of the}} graphic design department at the Ontario College of Art and Design as being [...] "trite, banal, ordinary and not too inspiring". Botanist Sean Blaney told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the depiction of the maple leaf on the banknote is that of an invasive five-lobed Norway Maple, not a maple tree indigenous to Canada such as the <b>three-lobed</b> sugar maple. A spokesperson for the Bank of Canada stated that the design was [...] "a stylized blend of different Canadian maple species". The 2009 focus group report stated {{that the image of}} the train on the $10 banknote was attractive but uninspiring and outdated, and drew complaints from people in Atlantic Canada where many [...] "railway links have been decommissioned".|$|E
2500|$|Coelacanths {{are a part}} of the clade Sarcopterygii, or the lobe-finned fishes. Externally, several {{characteristics}} {{distinguish the}} coelacanth from other lobe-finned fish. They possess a <b>three-lobed</b> caudal fin, also called a trilobate fin or a diphycercal tail. A secondary tail extending past the primary tail separates the upper and lower halves of the coelacanth. Cosmoid scales act as thick armor to protect the coelacanth's exterior. Several internal traits also aid in differentiating coelacanths from other lobe-finned fish. At the back of the skull, the coelacanth possesses a hinge, the intracranial joint, which allows it to open its mouth extremely wide. Coelacanths also retain an oil-filled notochord, a hollow, pressurized tube which is replaced by the vertebral column early in embryonic development in most other vertebrates. The coelacanth heart is shaped differently from that of most modern fish, with its chambers arranged in a straight tube. The coelacanth braincase is 98.5% filled with fat; only 1.5% of the braincase contains brain tissue. The cheeks of the coelacanths are unique because the opercular bone is very small and holds a large soft-tissue opercular flap. A spiracular chamber is present, but the spiracle is closed and never opens during development. Coelacanth also possess a unique rostral organ within the ethmoid region of the braincase. Also unique to extant coelacanths is the presence of a [...] "fatty lung" [...] or a fat-filled single-lobed vestigial lung, homologous to other fishes' swim bladder. The parallel development of a fatty organ for buoyancy control suggest a unique specialization for deep-water habitats. There has also been discovered small, hard but flexible plates around the vestigial lung in adult specimen, though not around the fatty organ. The plates most likely had a regulation function for the volume of the lung. Due to the size of the fatty organ, it is assumed to be responsible for the kidney's unusual relocation. The two kidneys, which are fused into one, are located ventrally within the abdominal cavity, posterior to the cloaca.|$|E
60|$|On a warm, {{brilliant}} {{morning in}} late April I {{paid a visit}} to a shallow lakelet or pond five or six acres in extent which I had discovered some weeks before hidden in a depression in the land, among luxuriant furze, bramble, and blackthorn bushes. Between the thickets the boggy ground was everywhere covered with great tussocks of last year's dead and faded marsh grass--a wet, rough, lonely place where a lover of solitude need have no fear of being intruded on by a being of his own species, or even a wandering moorland donkey. On arriving at the pond I was surprised and delighted to find half the surface covered with a thick growth of bog-bean just coming into flower. The quaint <b>three-lobed</b> leaves, shaped like a grebe's foot, were still small, and the flowerstocks, thick as corn in a field, were crowned with pyramids of buds, cream and rosy-red like the opening dropwort clusters, and {{at the lower end of}} the spikes were the full-blown singular, snow-white, cottony flowers--our strange and beautiful water edelweiss.|$|E
