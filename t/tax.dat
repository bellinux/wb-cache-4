5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income <b>tax</b> law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income <b>tax</b> rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era <b>tax</b> rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this <b>tax</b> entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top <b>tax</b> rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate <b>tax</b> and the Alternative Minimum <b>Tax.</b> He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these <b>tax</b> cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on <b>tax</b> deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed <b>tax</b> package, which included increasing the income <b>tax</b> on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales <b>tax</b> to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing <b>tax.</b> After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the <b>tax</b> package. She retained the corporate licensing <b>tax</b> increase, but replaced the sales <b>tax</b> and income <b>tax</b> modifications with a flat five percent personal income <b>tax</b> and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E

The modified plan would have provided across-the-board <b>tax</b> cuts by reducing income <b>tax</b> rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate <b>tax</b> and Alternative Minimum <b>Tax.</b> The plan would also have replaced the corporate income <b>tax</b> with a border-adjusted business consumption <b>tax</b> of 8.5%.

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and <b>tax</b> experts support the idea of a consumption <b>tax,</b> many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption <b>tax</b> (the FairTax is one such <b>tax)</b> would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border <b>tax</b> adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing <b>tax</b> incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income <b>tax</b> industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income <b>tax).</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{this broad}} sense, income <b>taxes,</b> value added <b>taxes</b> (VATs), sales <b>taxes,</b> and {{transfer}} <b>taxes</b> {{are examples of}} other excise <b>taxes,</b> but are typically not called excise <b>taxes</b> (in the United States) because of the different ways they are imposed.

5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} <b>tax</b> {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the <b>tax</b> would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal <b>tax</b> revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the <b>tax</b> rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different <b>tax</b> rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private <b>tax</b> farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service <b>tax</b> collectors.
