5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed <b>that</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; it is her sister who suffers from bipolar disorder.|$|E

[...] Conservative commentator Barbara Olson would entitle her highly unflattering 1999book Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton, in reference to Clinton's Travelgate phrase. [...] However, these had little effect on Hillary Clinton's career, as she won the 2000election to the Senate, won re-election in 2006, became a strong contender for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2008 presidential election, then served as U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and then ran for president again in 2016, becoming the nominee.|$|E

Following the Democrats' loss of congressional control in the 1994 elections, Clinton had engaged the services of Human Potential Movement proponent Jean Houston. Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection, and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton, critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding séances with Roosevelt. The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible. In her 2003 autobiography Living History, Clinton titled an entire chapter [...] "Conversations with Eleanor", and stated that holding [...] "imaginary conversations [...] actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems, provided you choose the right person to visualize. Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal." ...|$|E

University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson's 2006study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state's senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York's Democrats and Republicans.|$|E

40|$|Politeness is {{a system}} of {{interpersonal}} relations designed to facilitate interaction by minimizing the potential for conflict and confrontation inherent in all human interchange (Yule; 1996 : 106). One {{of the ways to}} minimize the potential conflict is positive politeness strategies This is a study of positive politeness strategies used by <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> in the First Democratic Presidential Debate 2015 by using Brown and Levinson‟s theory. This study applied sociolinguistics approach to analyze the factors <b>that</b> underlie <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> to use the strategies. This study aimed are (1) to identify the types of positive politeness strategies used by <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> and also (2) to explain factors <b>that</b> underlie <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> in using positive politeness strategies. This research employed descriptive qualitative research. The data were in the form of utterances uttered by <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> in the First Democratic Presidential Debate 2015. The data were taken from the script of the First Democratic Presidential debate by identifying, describing, analyzing and concluding the utterances. There were 28 data that found by the researcher. The result of this research showed two points. First, seven strategies of positive politeness appear. They were (1) exaggerate (interest, approval, sympathy with H),(2) intensify interest to H, (3) avoid disagreement, (4) presuppose/raise/assert common ground, (5) offer, promise, (6) include both S and H in the activity and (7) give (or ask for reason). The highest rank is offer, promise whereas the lowest rank is give (or asks for reason). Second, there were four factors <b>that</b> underlie <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> in choosing positive politeness strategies. The factors are: 1. The participants: who is speaking and who are they speaking to? 2. The setting or social context of the interaction: where are they speaking to? 3. The topic: what is being talked about? 4. The function: why are they speaking?. In addition, through this study, it reveals that sociolinguistics approach can be used to identify the background or factors that underlie someone using strategies in a debate..
