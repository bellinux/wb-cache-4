40|$|As {{humankind}} {{heads into}} space, {{one of our}} primary goals is to find new worlds to settle. Mars stands out as {{far and away the}} most practical choice to begin this next phase of human civilization. Apart from its relative closeness, {{one of the main reasons}} for this is Mars’s potential for terraforming. <b>The</b> <b>red</b> <b>planet’s</b> characteristics, while representing challenges, offer an opportunity for the manifestation of a vision which has permeated human thought since the dawn of science fiction – another planet that humans can walk on without the need for a spacesuit; a planet with air, water, soil, plants and animals. Numerous thinkers have contributed to the development of terraforming strategies. This paper expands on previous work, incorporating our current understanding of Mars as well as emerging technologies. The result is a strategy that incorporates past ideas with several new ones. Terraforming is organised into 3 primary tasks: increasing the temperature, building the atmosphere, and implanting the biosphere. These are implemented in stages, favouring solutions that are controllable yet still fast. The use of robotics and genetic engineering are emphasized, based on the assumption that these technologies will be much more advanced, probably even commonplace, during the 21 st – 22 nd century...|$|R

The chapter begins with a vision from the Orb of a red planet; Cas hones in on a white temple on a mesa near the planet’s equator. The temple is immaculate and white, somehow {{untouched}} by <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>planet’s</b> surface. It remains the same at all points in time up to the present. Cas goes to take a walk when Bobby asks if she wants lunch, and she sees police cars driving by on Route 67. She then asks Bobby if he knows where their friends Endoria, Artemis, Treebeard, Sorcerer, or Warlock are; he does not. But their friend Deakin, who goes by the nickname Merlin, is safe in a nearby hotel, and he invited them over for dinner. Bobby seems slightly uncomfortable about that, and she assumes it is because Cas had a fling with Deakin in the 1970s. Cas thinks about how Recluse managed to completely erase all traces of them from the Internet, including the information they wanted the public to know. Then she hears a distant cry and remembers April 15, 1958, when a formula had suddenly occurred to her. As Bobby eats, Cas holds the Orb, and he suggests that it might be evil.|$|R

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Mars {{is a potential}} source of the gases essential for human exploration missions. Many international space agencies and scientists have shown great interest in developing chemical plants to make propellants and life-support consumables utilizing <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>planet's</b> atmosphere and Earth-sourced H₂. Electrolyzing carbon dioxide to produce oxygen by a solid oxide electrolysis cell has been {{proven to be a}} potential candidate. A solid oxide electrolysis cell, which consists of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia sandwiched between two electrodes, is designed, manufactured and tested. The electrode/electrolyte interfacial polarization characteristics are investigated with the aid of the current interruption method using a four-electrode set-up. Activation overpotentials, which are free of ohmic losses, are measured in the temperature range from 1023 to 1123 K for the carbon dioxide electrode and the oxygen electrode. Both the electrode activation overpotentials show the Tafel behavior. In order to increase the active electrochemical reaction sites, platinum yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet electrode is investigated. A solid oxide electrolysis cell with cermet electrodes shows high performance and significantly reduces anode activation overpotentials, and ohmic resistance as well. A 1 -D steady state solid oxide electrolysis cell model is set up to take into account different kinetics: (1) surface exchange kinetics at the gas/electrode interface involving adsorption/desorption; (2) mass transfer of the reactants and products involving the bulk diffusion and surface diffusion; and (3) electrochemical kinetics involving charge transfer at the triple phase boundary. The solid oxide electrolysis cell's performance and voltage are predicted at any given current based on this model. The effects of surface diffusion coefficients, adsorption/desorption rate constants, and anodic/cathodic reaction rate constants on carbon dioxide electrolysis are studied. A comparison of solid oxide electrolysis cells between the numerical results and the experimental results is made...|$|R
