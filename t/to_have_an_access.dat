50|$|Borama Airport, {{which is}} 2 km long and 200 meters wide, was {{constructed}} in 1988 by former collapsed socialist government. The purpose the airport was built was to enable the region <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>access</b> to air transport for the movement of goods and people and link the region to the outside world.Current operations of the airport are very limited. Most of passenger, cargo planes and UN aircraft use Hargeisa and Berbera airports due to appropriate airport facilities and services. Moreover, the airport runway is unpaved and rough and its land demarcation is not yet fixed by the local government. Thus, the airport area is being frequently infringed by land grabbers. The airport has no security fence and, consequently, exposed to roaming livestock. Besides, due to absence of the fence, truck drivers use the runway as road and pose unnecessary risks to aircraft. Additionally, the airport is missing some vey essential services and facilities such weather forecasting services, fire trucks, air communication and water supply system.Lack of institutional capacities such shortage of trained staff, budgetary restrictions and lack of transport {{are some of the}} constraints hampering Borama Airport operations. If the above challenges are duly addressed, airport operation would probably resume operations.|$|E
50|$|Information {{disclosure}} {{gives an}} opportunity to the public to immediately react and avoid exposure to potential chemical hazards and risks for example by changing consumer behavior or applying pressure on the chemical firms etc. In the other hand, information disclosure also can motivate firms to search for safer alternatives. TSCA allows companies to claim their precise chemical volumes, components, chemical uses, and essentially any information provided to the EPA as business confidential except in the cases that chemical need health and safety studies. In this extent of TSCA, the EPA’ s ability is restricted to share information including the company’s identities, the chemical’s structures to any public groups except the designated contractors, or to law enforcement officials. It {{is important that the}} state and local environmental non-governmental agencies, environmental advocates and other public groups in obtaining chemical information in order to develop contingency plans and effective emergency responses in cases of highly toxic exposures. However, the EPA can only disclose confidential business information when it determines such disclosure is necessary to protect human health or the environment from an unreasonable risk. Similar to TSCA, REACH mandates chemical companies to disclosure of health and safety information that allows public <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>access</b> to the basic chemical information, including brief profiles of hazardous properties, authorized uses, and risk management measures. Also one of the main strength of REACH is in {{the extent to which the}} government intends to make the public receive as much as information possible, including identification of substances of a very high concern that are subject to authorization. REACH considers the full chemical composition, the preparation, the precise use, the detailed function or application of the chemical, the precise tonnage or volume of the chemical manufactured or placed on the market and the relationships between manufacturers, importers and downstream users as confidential for the industry’s economic purpose. PBTs (Bioaccumulative and Toxic Substances) and vPvB (Very Persistent and Very Bioaccumulative and Toxic Substances), and other chemicals that are classified as dangerous, REACH requires firms to submit safety data sheet. Therefore, the downstream users, manufacturers, retailers and importers will have the information they need to safely use and handle the chemicals. Unlike TSCA, REACH can share the firm’s chemical information with state, government authorities and EU organizations under an agreement between the firm and the other responsible parties.|$|E
