5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of Alpha Flight Northstar appeared in his own miniseries, which mostly ignored his sexuality, and eventually {{became a member of}} the X-Men. During his <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin. Notable also in Northstar's tenure in the X-Men was his death in three separate continuities in the same month. Other LGBT members of Marvel's mutant teams were X-Statixs Phat, Vivisector, and Bloke (until their deaths) and the villain Mystique, the latter having been in a relationship with the character Destiny, although this was not explicitly revealed until years after the relationship had ended with Destiny's murder.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E

5|$|By early 2011, Hughes's {{velocity}} on {{his fastball}} was down several mph; John Harper of the New York Daily News speculated that Hughes's overuse of the cutter was to blame, not a dead arm. Hughes {{continued to use}} the cutter into {{the start of the}} 2012 season; he posted a 7.88 ERA in April, throwing the cutter about 12% of the <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> span.

5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population {{was in the process}} of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} reissued {{nationwide}} once more on April 15, 1977, {{this time with}} simulated stereo sound. This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution, since RKO had not {{been part of a}} release since 1946. It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence would have required to be re-shot. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film's running <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> version remains unclear in existing records.|$|E
5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing {{the amount of time}} spent on the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions had yet to be implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to bring in the maximum number of players into the game. While making the game completely free and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company experienced with online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E

A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Flights Northstar, {{a member}} of the {{original}} Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally ignored his sexuality: Criticism has been levelled at the fact that in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, though he finally kissed his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series. Northstar eventually became {{a member of}} the X-Men. During his <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin.|$|E
5|$|Another storyline rivalry {{heading into}} Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship between the champion, A.J. Styles, and the challenger, Christopher Daniels, in a thirty-minute Iron Man match. An Iron Man match {{involves}} two competitors fighting for a predetermined amount of <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case thirty-minutes, after which whoever gained more pinfalls or submissions is the victor. The rivalry for this match began on the January 21 episode of Impact!, when Daniels challenged Styles to a match that night, in which if Styles could not defeat him in under ten-minutes then Daniels got a X Division Championship match at Against All Odds. The match ended in a time limit draw, which meant per the pre-match stipulation Daniels gained a championship match at Against All Odds. Dusty Rhodes then entered the arena after the match and announced that the contest would be a thirty-minute Iron Man match.|$|E

5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived at}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted {{exclusively}} {{to the music of}} Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch. Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica sent a team {{to compete}} at the Beijing Olympics in the men's 4 x 400meters relay. During the {{semifinal}} (first) round, Jamaica's team included three athletes who had also competed in individual events: Michael Blackwood, Sanjay Ayre, and Ricardo Chambers. It also included Allodin Fothergill, a then 21-year-old athlete born in Saint Catherine Parish and from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore {{who participated in the}} Olympics for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> relay. Placed in the second heat of the August 22 semifinal round, the Jamaican team placed third in the heat with a time of 3:00.09. The German relay ranked behind it in fourth place (3:03.49), while the Bahamian one ranked ahead in second (2:59.88). The heat itself was led by the British relay (2:59.33). Overall, Jamaica's team ranked fourth of the 16 competing relays. It advanced to the final round.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{the first}} game in the series, {{released}} in Japan on March 28, 2002 for PlayStation 2. Tetsuya Nomura has served as game director, his first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position. Kingdom Hearts introduced the main characters (Sora, Kairi and Riku) of the series, and established the plot's framework involving hearts and dark beings known as the Heartless. It also established the role of Disney characters in the series, with character cameos from the Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts was released in North America on September 17, 2002, and featured additional content that {{was not in the}} original Japanese version. The game was later re-released exclusively in Japan as Kingdom Hearts Final Mix on December 26, 2002. Final Mix includes the content from the North American release and additional enemies, cutscenes, and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Relinquishing his {{position}} with the Navy Office in 1962, Becher {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. In January 1964 he returned to Australia, and was made Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. During his <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role Becher became embroiled in the controversy that followed the collision of HMA Ships Voyager and Melbourne, which took place in February that year. Prior to giving evidence before the Royal Commission that had been established to investigate the incident, Becher had discussed events with Melbournes Commanding Officer, Commander Ronald Robertson. The discussion became public knowledge, and led to suggestions of conspiracy. Becher stated to the commission that Melbourne should have questioned Voyagers final movements; his evidence is alleged to have influenced the Royal Commissioner, Sir John Spicer, to place a degree of blame on Robertson. In 1965, Becher assumed his final command as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, before retiring from the Royal Australian Navy on 6 March 1966.|$|E
5|$|Snowboarding is a {{sport that}} has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or {{disciplines}} added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and {{was the only one}} not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.|$|E
