5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|This {{resistance}} to extreme environments has made archaea {{the focus of}} speculation about the possible properties of extraterrestrial life. Some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> Mars, leading to the suggestion that viable microbes could be transferred between planets in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1454, {{undertaken}} {{against the background}} of another French invasion scare, shows that the 1377 system for maintaining the walls was still in operation. A town gunner had also been appointed by the 15th century, earning the highest salary of any local official and was responsible for maintaining the guns and manufacturing gunpowder. As late as the mid-16th century, additional improved rectangular gunports, similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the Device Forts along the Channel, were added to the West Gate by the quays.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> dry land.|$|E

5|$|Few crashes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. United Airlines Flight 811, which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global positioning system (GPS) for civilian use.|$|E
5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he {{has been criticized for}} not respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E

5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, {{that is to}} say, {{the remains of a}} plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> {{the eastern edge of the}} Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors plateau.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> nearby plants.|$|E
5|$|Roman baths {{played a}} leading role in the {{development}} of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These domes are very conical in shape, similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified from the middle of the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. Domes were particularly well suited to the hot rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.|$|E

5|$|The night shark has {{a slender}} build with an elongated, pointed snout. The nares are flanked by {{moderately}} developed flaps of skin. The eyes are large, circular, and green in life, with irregularly shaped pupils and a nictitating membrane (protective third eyelid). The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows {{at the corners}} and usually bears 15 tooth rows {{on either side of}} both jaws, plus 12 upper and 1 lower symphysial (jaw midline) tooth rows. Each upper tooth has a smooth to serrated edge, a narrow cusp becoming more oblique towards the corner of the mouth, and 25 coarse serrations {{at the base of the}} trailing margin. The number and size of serrations on the leading margin of the tooth cusp increase relative <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the trailing margin as the animal grows older. The lower teeth are upright and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are rather short.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} I-5 near the Mexican border {{in a far}} south part of San Ysidro, a {{neighborhood}} of San Diego. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with State Route905 (SR905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide {{between rich and poor}} in the city of Chula Vista; those on {{the eastern side of the}} freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CRS17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} has a {{matching}} , with windows of equal value <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> {{the first floor}} below. The very latest innovation, sash windows, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and attic storey used the more old-fashioned mullioned and transomed windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt {{in the design of}} Coleshill House in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day Roger North lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), {{as one of the most}} important inventions of his day.|$|E

5|$|The tariff fight {{continued}} into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control of the House, with a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as {{much in favor of}} tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>on</b> manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.|$|E
