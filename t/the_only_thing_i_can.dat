It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the tour}} of South Africa, Wilkinson's 1939 season was disappointing. A hand injury {{prevented}} him from playing {{early on in the}} season.
