5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN often takes {{a leading role}} in {{co-ordinating}} emergency relief. The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs {{are paid for by the}} UN's primary budget.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
5|$|The {{voters of}} Henderson County chose Dixon to {{represent}} them at the state constitutional convention of 1849. The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie {{by a vote of}} 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic. Though some of these ideas were challenged, all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850.|$|E
5|$|For some Germans, the {{definition}} of nation did not include pluralism, and Catholics in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As chancellor, Bismarck tried without much success to limit {{the influence of the}} Roman Catholic Church and of its party-political arm, the Catholic Center Party, in schools and education and language-related policies. The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, {{under the control of the}} state, resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.|$|E

5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> {{of southern}} blacks were ineffective, as were {{his attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, {{and none of the}} main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{letters from}} the precentor of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to {{celebrate}} the Easter Mass {{and to deal with}} pressing issues in the diocese. Neville's duties as chancellor kept him from attending to much of the business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his cathedral chapter appears to have been good. He employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights,</b> lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the Earl of Arundel or the earl's men for hunting on land the bishop considered to be his own.|$|E

5|$|The Cultural and Educational rights, {{given in}} Articles 29 and 30, are {{measures}} <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by {{enabling them to}} conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination. Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own, the right to conserve and develop the same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to 50percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community.|$|E

40|$|This article revisits and {{examines}} whether the fairness and justice doctrine of Armstrong v.

The Court {{has relied on}} Armstrong to show {{the purpose of the}} Takings Clause in many takings decisions. However, can Armstrong serve a greater purpose? In Dolan v. City of Tigard, the United States Supreme Court applied the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to justify the need for a standard of review <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> just compensation. The Court transported questionable constitutional doctrine to validate Justice Holmes’s regulatory takings theory. Yet, in Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the Court applied Armstrong’s fairness and justice doctrine to justify not applying standards of review to a complete range of factual theories of regulatory takings theory. Therefore, the Court leads one to ask whether the Armstrong fairness and justice doctrine should be considered in justifying the selection of standards of review and principles <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> just compensation...|$|R
