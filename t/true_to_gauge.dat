60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the spring}} of 1899 some {{hundreds}} of thousands of hollow-headed bullets, made in England, were condemned as unsatisfactory, not being <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>gauge,</b> &c., and were sent to South Africa for target practice only. A quantity of this ammunition, known as 'Metford Mark IV.,' was sent up to Dundee by order of General Symons for practice in field firing. As Mark IV. was not for use in a war with white races all these cartridges were called in as soon as Kruger declared war, and the officers responsible thought they were every one returned. By some blundering in the packing at home, however, some of this Mark IV. must have got mixed up with the ordinary, or Mark II., ammunition, and was found on our men by the Boers on October 30. Accordingly a very careful inspection was ordered, and a few Mark IV. bullets were found in our men's pouches, and at once removed. Their presence was purely accidental, and undoubtedly caused by a blunder in the Ordnance Department long before the war, and it was in consequence of this that some hollow-headed bullets were fired by the English early in the war without their knowledge.|$|E

The rigid rotor is studied in detail and the similarity of this simple quantum system <b>to</b> a <b>gauge</b> theory is explicitly demonstrated. The system is quantized as a gauge-theory and then the similarity between BRST and Gupta-Bleuler approach is displayed. We also apply our formalism <b>to</b> <b>true</b> <b>gauge</b> theories. Both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories are studied in detail. Finally, the Hamiltonian treatment of the relativistic and the spinning relativistic particle is presented. L...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe joint {{development}} of polymorphic molecular markers and paternity analysis methods provides {{new approaches to}} investigate ongoing patterns of pollen flow in natural plant populations. However, paternity studies are hindered by false paternity assignment and the nondetection of <b>true</b> fathers. <b>To</b> <b>gauge</b> the risk of {{these two types of}} errors, we performed a simulation study to investigate the impact on paternity analysis of: (i) the assumed values for the size of the breeding male population (NBMP), and (ii) the rate of scoring error in genotype assessment. Our simulations were based on microsatellite data obtained from a natural population of the entomophilous wild service tree, Sorbus torminalis (L.) Crantz. We show that an accurate estimate of NBMP is required to minimize both types of errors, and we assess the reliability of a technique used to estimate NBMP based on parent-offspring genetic data. We then show that scoring errors in genotype assessment only slightly affect the assessment of paternity relationships, and conclude that it is generally better to neglect the scoring error rate in paternity analyses within a nonisolated population...|$|R
