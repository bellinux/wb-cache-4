Bird said that the actors were initially disheartened by the absence of Palmer, and nervous about the direction of Morris and Beesley due to <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of experience in the position.|$|E

Such requirements are taken from software engineering as well as from hypermedia engineering fields.

50|$|The {{young of}} some birds learn to {{communicate}} vocally by social learning, imitating their parents, {{as well as}} the dominant birds of <b>their</b> flock. <b>Lacking</b> vocal cords, birds are thought to make tones and sounds using throat muscles and membranes - the syrinx in particular. There are likely to be limitations on the sounds that birds can mimic due to differences in anatomical structures, such as <b>their</b> <b>lacking</b> lips. However, {{it has been suggested that}} mimicry amongst birds is almost ubiquitous and it is likely that eventually, all species will be shown to be able to have some ability to mimic extra-specific sounds (but not necessarily human speech).|$|R

5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they can take up. This is due to <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E
5|$|The Mysida {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Peracarida, which means “near to shrimps”. Although in many respects mysids appear similar to some shrimps, the main characteristic separating them from the superorder Eucarida is <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of free-swimming larvae. The order Mysida is extensive and currently includes approximately 160 genera, containing more than 1000 species.|$|E

In particular, children might lose the interest when learning music due to <b>their</b> <b>lacking</b> fundamental knowledge.

5|$|The farm {{seizures}} {{were often}} violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, {{with many of}} their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of access to fertiliser.|$|E

When he was sent Michael McDowell's original script for Beetlejuice, Burton agreed to direct, although Larry Wilson and later Warren Skaaren were hired to rewrite it. Beetlejuice was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$73.7 million from a budget of US$15 million. It won the Academy Award for Best Makeup and three Saturn Awards: Best Horror Film, Best Makeup and Best Supporting Actress for Sylvia Sidney, her final award before her death in 1999.|$|E

5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|E
5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear X {{continues}} its predecessor's timeline with new characters and gameplay features. Still a four-button game, its instant-kill techniques were weakened and a survival mode {{was added to}} the previous game's three modes. The Dreamcast and PS2 versions have sold over 100,000 copies in Japan; they have been praised for their graphics, controls and characters but criticized for <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of replay value. The GBA version was the poorest-received, with the main complaints concerning ease and graphics.|$|E

50|$|The eastern Spadefoot {{entered the}} {{endangered}} list of Pennsylvania in 2005 (though also endangered in: Ohio, Connecticut, and Rhode Island), when living populations were only found {{in two of}} their known locations. Which is odd because the American Spadefoot tadpole has the highest metamorphosis rates in any amphibian. Though one possibility for <b>their</b> <b>lacking</b> of population size could be that, “the pools often dry up before the tadpoles get to complete metamorphosis”(Naish, 2015); though there are countless others.|$|R
5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E
5|$|Ladd's group {{soon found}} their {{business}} expertise {{in other areas}} did not apply as well to the iron industry. <b>Their</b> <b>lack</b> of experience, coupled with a dispute over water rights, caused the company to close in 1869. After a brief respite in which they filled an order for iron wheels for the Central Pacific Railroad from 1874 to 1876, the company closed for good in 1878 and the assets were sold off at a sheriff's auction.|$|E
5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. <b>Their</b> <b>lack</b> of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E

Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973.
