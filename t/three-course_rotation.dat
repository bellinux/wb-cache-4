50|$|The mediaeval {{village was}} in a wooded valley and {{developed}} along {{both sides of the}} Bourn Brook. The farming system of common grazing land and six large fields managed in a <b>three-course</b> <b>rotation</b> lasted until the Enclosure Act in 1809. By 1279 there were 183 families and 900 people; the names of fields and families from this time are still known in the area. By the 14th century, Bourn's population dropped to 299 because of factors including the plague, high taxes, poor weather, the emergence of the yeoman farmer and decrease in serfdom.|$|E
50|$|The serfs of Rátót village got rid {{of their}} socage in 1848. By this time, the cotter's system, and tiny pieces of the earlier fee estates became characteristic. After the abolishment of serfdom, only the pasture fields {{remained}} in common use, and the earlier seigniorial vineyard was also distributed. The farmers mostly produced rye, barley and maize in the sandy soil in the generally used <b>three-course</b> <b>rotation.</b> In 1895, {{more than half of}} the farms were arable land, while the proportion of meadow and pasture was close to one third of the whole area, which made it possible to spread the profitable cattle breeding on the pastures fed with abundant waters. At the turn of the century, eighty-seven percent of the total population lived directly from agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|Miry usually {{practiced the}} common-field system, {{in which all}} peasants grew the same crop in the same part of the mir's arable at the same time. Thus the whole harvest on a {{particular}} area could be gathered at the same time. This was necessary because of the peasants' custom of pasturing their livestock on the stubble. To preserve soil fertility on the arable, the mir generally employed a crop-rotation with fallow. The distribution of different crops would be `cycled' around from year to year. The most widespread system in use was the three-course or triennial rotation. One-third of the land was dedicated to winter grain (rye or winter wheat), another third to spring grain (oats or spring wheat) and the remainder lay fallow. [...] Other crops (e.g. legumes, vetches) were occasionally grown with the grain and {{took part in the}} same cycle. The <b>three-course</b> <b>rotation</b> was an inefficient system, one-third of the land always lying fallow. During the later 19th and earlier 20th centuries a start was made in introducing improved rotations with reduced or eliminated fallow (see `Improving Agriculture' below).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, Zwijndrecht-Burcht was sparsely populated, its {{landscape}} consisting mainly of wet woodland and small settlements separated by forests. This situation remained until {{the latter half}} of the 11th century, when an increase in population necessitated changes in land use: the forests between settlements were cleared and fields were formed into communal agricultural spaces, using a <b>three-course</b> crop <b>rotation</b> system. [...] These were referred to as “kouters” or ploughshares. Raised paths through the wetlands evolved into dikes, and by the 14th century, polders were in use.|$|R
40|$|In 1992, the European Union {{created the}} current {{set-aside}} regime. The risks that {{the introduction of}} this new "crop" into the <b>three-courses</b> crop <b>rotation</b> might cause to the environment were unknown especially after {{the destruction of the}} set-aside cover. Over a period of four years, nitrate quantities were measured in the soil profile to a depth of 1. 5 m in order to evaluate the pollution risks to groundwater. The swards studied were perennial ryegrass, red clover, perennial ryegrass/red clover and spontaneous cover. These experiments were carried out before, during and after the set-aside period, i. e. also during the subsequent crop. Results show that the sowing of a set-aside cover before winter leads to a reduction in the leaching risks. Little nitrate generally remains in the sown plots; the highest quantities are measured after red clover: 26 +/- 10 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1). As far as spontaneous covers are concerned, the quantities can be high and highly variable: 43 +/- 48 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1). At the sowing of sugar beet, i. e. 4 months after the set-aside cover is destroyed, mineralisation of the incorporated covers has started: 17 +/- 11 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1) for the perennial ryegrass and 96 +/- 19 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1) for the red clover sown before winter. However, in each case, nitrate is mainly located in {{the upper part of the}} profile. When sugar beet is harvested, taking into account a nitrogen fertilisation of 65 or 75 N kg ha(- 1), little nitrate remains in the profile. Therefore, there is little risk of groundwater pollution if a set-aside cover is sown and if it is destroyed after 15 November before a spring crop...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to assess the effect of long-term application of different doses of nitrogen fertilizers with or without manure to changes in the total organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, evaluation of dissolved organic carbon content and the value of absorbance coefficient (A 4 / 6) in sandy loam soil. The base of research was the long-term field experiment, established in 1979 at the Wierzchucinek Experimental Station close to Bydgoszcz city - Poland. The experiment was carried out in the <b>three-course</b> crop <b>rotation,</b> potato, rye, rye in randomized split-plot design. The experimental treatments were four levels of N fertilizers in 0, 47, 93, and 140 kg*ha- 1 *yr- 1 (N 0, N 1, N 2, N 3) as a 1 st factor of experiment, and the same doses of N fertilizers with farmyard manure application (30 t*ha- 1) as a 2 nd factor. After 36 years of experiment the content of total organic carbon was 26 % lower and the content of total nitrogen 13 % higher compared to the values determined before the experiment foundation (1979). The consequence of changes in the content of organic carbon and total nitrogen, are changes in the ratio of organic carbon content and total nitrogen content. It was noticed that the use of manure and different nitrogen doses resulted in a decrease of organic carbon content and total nitrogen content value. After application of different nitrogen doses, organic carbon content ranged from 122. 4 to 152. 2 mg*kg- 1. The same nitrogen doses applied simultaneously with farmyard manure increased the organic carbon content, which ranged from 133. 5 to 166. 7 mg*kg- 1. The changes of the organic carbon content did not effect on percentage of this fraction in the total organic carbon. Percentage of organic carbon content in total organic carbon content was on averaged 1. 6 %. After the application of different nitrogen doses, humic acids of analyzed soils were characterized by lower average value of A 4 / 6 (5. 4). However, the application of nitrogen doses with manure brought a higher - 6. 3 - A 4 / 6 value. Farmyard manure application caused the formation of humic acids of lower molecular weight and a low humification degree...|$|R
40|$|H. L. Gray, {{writing in}} 1915, {{stressed}} {{the fact that}} the Chiltern Hills lay in a transition area between Midland England, with its more regular open field arrangements, and the Southeast, with less regular systems. Basing his conclusions largely on sixteenth and early seventeenth century surveys, he showed that field systems within the Hills were different and distinctive from those on either side. The present study is the first comprehensive account of these distinctive systems. The medieval field arrangements of four parishes are examined in detail, and evidence for the whole region before 1850 is summarised. The most important features of the Chiltern field systems were: (1) the high proportion of enclosed arable land, particularly in the southwest; and (2) the existence of numerous, relatively small, common fields within the individual township. A <b>three-course</b> <b>rotation</b> had appeared as early as the twelfth century, and was later widely followed; but this does not imply the presence of a simple two- or three-field system. Farm holdings were concentrated in one part of a township, while the individual common arable holding was distributed irregularly between {{only a few of the}} many common fads. There was little meadow or grassland pasture, apart from that in parks, but woods and wastes were important elements, except in the northeast. The settlement pattern combined elements of both nucleation and dispersal. These features had appeared in the area by the mid-thirteenth century, when large-scale assarting was coming to an end. Their origins were, as Gray suggested, probably connected with the slow and piecemeal nature of colonisation in this hilly and heavily wooded region, and they survived largely unchanged until the mid-sixteenth century. After c. 1550 the common field system began to disintegrate, with widespread piecemeal enclosure from the common arable, and almost all traces of the old arrangements bad disappeared by 1850...|$|E
