5|$|Aalborg traces {{its history}} back over a {{thousand}} years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord.

These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Britain, {{what is now}} Ashford was {{the meeting}} point of two main roads.

5|$|It {{was these}} {{similarities}} that lead theorists {{to conclude that}} the kulintang was originally imported to the Philippines during the migration of the kolenang through the Malay Archipelago.

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, Reshef {{focused on}} clearing the Tirtur Road. He left {{a battalion of}} around 30 tanks between the junction and {{the western part of}} the Chinese Farm, and prepared to attack with two armored battalions provided by Sharon. He concentrated on the section of the Tirtur Road defended by an Egyptian battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade. One of Reshef's battalions attacked from the north-east, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> the west. The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance, aided by fire from tanks and anti-tank weapons on the slopes of Missouri, a hill north-west of the Chinese Farm, causing Reshef to break off his attack.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the village}} of Carabane's {{official}} population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most {{of the population is}} Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée {{at the time of the}} first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.|$|E
5|$|John led an {{expedition}} to Ireland in 1210 {{in an effort to}} bring the Anglo-Norman barons under control. He opened talks with the native Irish kings, and some accounts state that his negotiations were so successful that the native Irish submitted to him. In contrast, the historian Seán Duffy has argued that the native Irish nobility were just as resistant to John as the Anglo-Norman barons. After John's return to England he ordered de Gray to build three new castles in Connacht, one of them at Athlone. Associated with the castle building were two military invasions of Connacht by the royal government– one from Meath and Leinster and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> Munster. De Gray left Ireland in 1211 to lead a military campaign against the Welsh, leaving his deputy Richard de Tuit in charge of the country.|$|E

5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E
5|$|Observatories were {{constructed}} {{to the north}} and south of the mountain, plus a bothy to accommodate equipment and the scientists. Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine the zenith distances with respect to the plumb line for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed due south. Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>From</b> the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars. By conducting sets of measurements with the plane of the zenith sector first facing east and then west, he successfully avoided any systematic errors arising from collimating the sector.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the concert, trains {{ran into}} Sarajevo {{for the first time since}} the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs, and the buildings around the stadium were lined with Irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out.|$|E

He also led the Italy Under-21 side to a semi-final finish in the 2002 edition of the tournament. Pirlo played for Italy at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, scoring a goal in Italy's 1–0 opening win over hosts Australia on 13 September; he also helped Italy win the bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>from</b> Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump.|$|E
