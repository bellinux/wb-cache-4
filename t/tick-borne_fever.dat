5000|$|Borrelia {{bacteria}} are well described elsewhere {{in association with}} Ixodes ticks for causing Lyme disease in humans, but this disease also affects domestic dogs. Borrelia anserina is transmitted by Argas persicus to poultry, causing avian borreliosis in {{a wide spread of}} tropical and subtropical countries. [...] Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophila) is a bacterium of deer that spreads to sheep where it causes <b>tick-borne</b> <b>fever</b> in Europe, resulting in abortion by ewes and temporary sterility of rams. This bacterium invades and proliferates in neutrophil cells of the blood. This depletes these antibacterial cells and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria which invade joints and cause the crippling disease of sheep called tick pyaemia. Anaplasma marginale infects marginal areas of red blood cells of cattle and causes anaplasmosis wherever boophilid ticks occur as transmitters. Anaplasma centrale tends to infect the central region of red blood cells, and is sufficiently closely related to An. marginale to have been used from long ago as a live vaccine to protect cattle against the more virulent An. marginale. Sheep and goats suffer disease from infection with Anaplasma ovis which is transmitted similarly to the anaplasmas described above. Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium) is transmitted mainly by Amblyomma hebraeum and Am. variegatum in Africa, causing the severe disease heartwater in cattle, sheep, and goats. This disease is named after the prominent sign of pericardial edema. The bacteria infect the brain, causing prostration.

Electron {{microscopy}} of <b>tick-borne</b> <b>fever</b> {{agent in}} bovine and ovine phagocytizing leukocytes. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 1478 – 1492. 1966. —Two strains of <b>tick-borne</b> <b>fever</b> agent, one more virulent to cattle {{and the other}} more virulent to sheep, were studied in thin sections of leukocyte concentrates of an affected calf and sheep, respectively. The calf was partially immune from previous infections. To obtain leukocyte concentrate, erythrocytes were lysed by ammonium chloride solution. Glutaraldehyde fixation and osmium tetroxide postfixation were used. Agent particles were detected in neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes (occasionally also in monocytes) inside cytoplasmic vacuoles. The preparation from the sheep revealed that the <b>tick-borne</b> <b>fever</b> agent has a life cycle; it appeared as large particles, intermediate forms, and small particles. In the preparation from the calf, only large particles were observed, probably {{as a result of}} partial immunity. Large particles had a cell wall, plasma membrane, cytoplasm with ribosome-like granules, and nucleoid. They were often elongated, bearing closer resemblance to rickettsiae than to psittacosis-lymphogranuloma-trachoma (PLT) agents. The arrangement of large particles in vacuoles was variable and provided an explanation for the different forms of light microscopic <b>tick-borne</b> <b>fever</b> bodies. The intermediate forms and small particles resembled those of PLT organisms. Release of particles occurred by rupture of inclusions. In the calf also extrusion of whole inclusions was observed. This phenomenon was thought to reflect increased resistance of the cells. The large particle was considered to be the usual infective form of the agent.

40|$|In North America, <b>tick-borne</b> {{relapsing}} <b>fever</b> {{is caused}} by the species Borrelia hermsii, B. parkeri, and B. turicatae, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of the respective infected tick vectors. Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of a surface lipoprotein of B. parkeri, designated BpcA, that binds the human complement regulators factor H and factor H-related protein 1 and, simulta-neously, the host protease plasminogen. In contrast, the homologous B. turicatae protein failed to bind human factor H and factor H-related protein 1 but retained its plasminogen binding capacity. Factor H bound to BpcA maintains its regulatory capacity to control C 3 b deposition and C 3 convertase activity. Ectopic expression of BpcA in a serum-sensitive B. burgdorferi strain protects transformed cells from complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, bound plasminogen/plasmin endows B. parkeri and B. turicatae with the potential to degrade extracellular matrix components. These findings expand our understanding of the putative recent evolutionary separation of Borrelia parkeri and Borrelia turicatae, provide evidence that B. parkeri differs from B. turicatae in its ability to resist complement attack, and may help in understanding the pathological processes underlying <b>tick-borne</b> relapsing <b>fever.</b> In North America, <b>tick-borne</b> relapsing <b>fever</b> (TBRF) {{is caused by}} the spirochete species Borrelia hermsii, B. parkeri...|$|R
