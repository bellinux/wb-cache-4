Drogba scored two goals in the group stage, opening the scoring in the 4–1 win over Benin, {{as well as in}} the 3–0 win over Mali. In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5–0 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the road for Drogba and the Ivory Coast, losing 4–1 to the {{eventual}} champions. On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the Second Test also {{affected}} the career paths of other players. England's inability to cut down the Australians resulted in the dropping of three of their bowlersWright, Laker and Coxonafter the Lord's Test. Coxon's debut was his only Test match, something believed to be caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his international career.|$|E
5|$|This however was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> General Nansouty's {{action at}} the great Battle of Wagram. Although the great cavalry attack had done much to ease the {{pressure}} on Napoleon's left-centre, the latter's situation remained critical. The Emperor thus launched the Corps of General Jacques MacDonald in an attack against the Austrian right-centre. MacDonald's attack formation, formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought, was a huge infantry attack column or square, comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for Napoleonic warfare. Four squadrons of Nansouty's carabiniers-à-cheval were sent to support the flank of this attack, {{with the rest of}} his division further back. Realising that his advance is hampered by intense Austrian artillery fire, MacDonald aimed to clear the enemy guns before him, asking for a cavalry charge from Walther's Guard cavalry on his right and Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division on his left. With no direct orders from the Emperor and his commander, Marshal Bessières, out of action, Walther opted not to move, while Nansouty did send his men forward but, having been positioned too far back, he arrived only after the enemy guns had moved away.|$|E

In February 1936 Hugh Wedge sparred with former heavyweight champion Max Baer in Oakland, as part of Baer's efforts to reclaim his title.

Despite a recession, Major led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in 1992. The events of Black Wednesday in 1992, party disunity over the European Union and several scandals involving Conservative politicians led to Labour under Tony Blair winning a landslide election victory in 1997. Labour had shifted its policies closer to the political centre, under the new slogan 'New Labour'. The Bank of England was given independence over monetary policy and Scotland and Wales were both given a devolved Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly respectively.
