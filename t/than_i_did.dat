These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still {{have something to say}} about the world we live in.|$|E
25|$|Murray became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 26 September 1915. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. After the war he wrote to Ian Hamilton, criticising Kitchener in harsh terms, writing that “He seldom told the absolute the truth and the whole truth” {{and that it was}} not until Kitchener left for his inspection of the Dardanelles that Murray was able to inform the Cabinet that volunteering had fallen far below the level needed to maintain a BEF of 70 divisions, requiring the introduction of conscription. The Cabinet insisted on proper General Staff papers being presented in Kitchener's absence. Murray wrote that “I have never in my forty years’ service done better work <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> during the three months I was CIGS”. Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey praised Murray highly as a real “St John the Baptist” to Sir William Robertson, his successor as CIGS.|$|E
500|$|Ulysses S. Grant, {{who had the}} {{opportunity}} to observe Pierce firsthand during the war, countered the allegations of cowardice in his memoirs, written several years after Pierce's death: [...] "Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the Presidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage. I was not a supporter of him politically, but I knew him more intimately <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> any other of the volunteer generals." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Department of Labor reissued federal {{guidelines}} in April 2010 governing {{the employment of}} unpaid interns under the Fair Labor Standards Act based on a 1947 Supreme Court decision, Stossel criticized the guidelines, appearing in a police uniform during an appearance on the Fox News program America Live, commenting, [...] "I’ve built my career on unpaid interns, and the interns {{told me it was}} great– I learned more from you <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in college." [...] Asked why he did not pay them if they were so valuable, he said he could not afford to.|$|E
500|$|A former Lowell operative, {{looking back}} on her {{experience}} in the mills, expressed a similar view: “After one has worked from ten to fourteen hours at manual labor, {{it is impossible to}} study History, Philosophy, or Science,” she wrote, “I well remember the chagrin I often felt when attending lectures, to find myself unable to keep awake…I am sure few possessed a more ardent desire for knowledge <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but such was the effect of the long hour system, that my chief delight was, after the evening meal, to place my aching feet in an easy position, and read a novel.” ...|$|E
500|$|Rogan recounted to The Irish Times {{the value}} he {{obtained}} from interviews with Morrison's first wife, {{as well as}} his partner in a later relationship, Michelle Rocca. [...] "Here was a man who had explored all these mystic religions, had undergone Gestalt therapy, who had been told by a Rosacrucian master that he had something called an 'Angelic Knot', suddenly hanging around fashionable nightclubs and being written about in gossip columns. The relationship with Michelle Rocca certainly helped, in that I got more out of one single interview done by Michelle Rocca <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> in entirety, from his first wife, Janet Planet," [...] said Rogan.|$|E

500|$|The Cars did not {{add a new}} bassist to {{the lineup}} to replace Orr; instead, the album's bass parts were {{programmed}} or performed by Hawkes and Lee, with Hawkes playing a bass once owned by Orr. While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This. In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, [...] "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would have done better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But we never wanted anybody from the outside." [...] Orr was given special thanks in the liner notes: [...] "Ben, your spirit was {{with us on this}} one." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "I {{loved this}} episode for... its careful {{layering}} {{and expansion of}} the series’ key themes, and for the way it’s setting us up for a truly superb, universe-shaking episode when Fringe returns Dec. 2." [...] The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray graded the episode with a B+, explaining he enjoyed the episode more than the previous visit to the parallel universe because [...] "the last five minutes or so of 'The Abducted' were more compelling than the case-of-the-week. But not far more. The Candy Man is just so creepy—and his crime so powerfully symbolic—that I felt better about this episode overall <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> about 'Amber." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraph called Agnew and Murphy's effort, [...] "new {{heights of}} ingenuity". Agnew's {{reaction}} to the event was, [...] "It's {{a sad day for}} everyone involved in English cricket. Is it really that cricket is getting so greedy that everyone who wants to come and report on the game {{for the good of the}} game is going to have to be charged for it?" [...] However, he remained upbeat about the situation: [...] "Actually I get rather more of a panoramic view of it from up here <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> yesterday in my commentary box. There's a little road that runs round the back of the ground. All manner of people are trundling up and down – buses, bikes and little three wheeled tuk-tuks – it's rather fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and a lot better budget." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; {{no one wants to be}} their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E
500|$|Bevin financed {{his primary}} {{campaign}} with over $2.5 {{million of his}} own money, representing 95% of the money he spent, and the National Journal opined that attracting donors from supporters of Comer, Heiner, Scott, and McConnell would be critical to his success in the general election. Almost immediately after his primary win, Bevin was asked about his support for McConnell, telling reporters, [...] "I literally know of no other elected official in this state who went to more events between May and November in support of candidates and support of Mitch McConnell and other down ticket races <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I knocked on doors, I made phone calls, I wrote checks myself, and I physically attended fundraiser after fundraiser." [...] Federal Election Commission records showed no evidence of contributions by Bevin to McConnell's campaign, and a McConnell advisor cited by Bevin to corroborate his support refused to do so when contacted by Insider Louisville.|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics were}} more negative. Rolling Stone called it [...] "mundane...with a {{predictable}} script", {{and at one}} point described Simpson's singing as [...] "wailing in lieu of hitting notes". [...] In its review, the BBC said that [...] "half the album ... feels self indulgent and lacks substance", but also said that [...] "in between the formulaic, innocuous songs are a smattering of catchy pop-rock tracks." [...] IGN.com called it [...] "by-the-books, generic (and at times bland) pop/rock", although it did say Simpson's vocals showed maturity and promise. A writer for Stylus magazine commented that [...] "after spending more than forty minutes with Ashlee, I feel like I don’t know her any better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> beforehand... for a record with the name Autobiography, it seems like no bigger criticism could be leveled." [...] The New York Times said that Autobiography [...] "is a thoroughly calculated package, aiming for the same audience that embraces Avril Lavigne and Pink." ...|$|E
500|$|Sternberg, still {{prospecting}} for Cope that spring, was woken by a liveryman who relayed {{word from}} Annie that Cope had died three days earlier. Sternberg {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "I had lost friends before, and I had known {{what it was to}} bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> over the news." [...] Cope's Quaker funeral consisted of six men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope's friend Persifor Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood, and Harrison Allen. The six sat around Cope's coffin among the fossils and Cope's pets, a tortoise and a Gila monster, for what Osborn called [...] "a perfect Quaker silence... an interminable length of time." [...] Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had brought along a Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, [...] "These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984 McCain and {{his wife}} Cindy had their first child together, {{daughter}} Meghan. [...] She was followed in 1986 by son John Sidney IV (known as Jack), and in 1988 by son James. [...] In 1991, Cindy McCain brought an abandoned three-month-old girl, who badly needed medical treatment for a severe cleft palate, to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa; the McCains decided to adopt her, and named her Bridget. [...] A drawn-out adoption process began, slowed down by uncertainty over the exact fate of the girl's father, but in 1993 the adoption was ruled final. [...] McCain then stood by his wife when she disclosed in 1994 a previous addiction to painkillers {{and said that she}} hoped the publicity would give other drug addicts courage in their struggles. [...] Beginning in the early 1990s, McCain began attending the 6,000-member North Phoenix Baptist Church in Arizona, part of the Southern Baptist Convention, later saying [...] " [...] the message and fundamental nature more fulfilling <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in the Episcopal church. [...] They're great believers in redemption, and so am I." [...] Nevertheless, he still identified himself as Episcopalian, and while Cindy and two of their children were baptized into the Baptist church, he was not.|$|E

500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if you were the one being wooed. I wanted to like it more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's love of wordplay and {{nonsense}} {{with a twist}} found a {{wider audience}} when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles {{came to me and}} I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book more seriously <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E
