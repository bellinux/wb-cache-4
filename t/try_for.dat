5|$|The {{second half}} started with Botha kicking a penalty {{to make the}} score 10–3. However Botha missed two further penalty kicks which proved crucial in {{the result of the}} match. Following a {{clearance}} kick from Robert du Preez, John Kirwan scored a <b>try</b> <b>for</b> New Zealand with Fox converting, making the score 17–3, before Fox scored another penalty to make it 20–3. Later in the match Danie Gerber scored a <b>try</b> <b>for</b> the Springboks which Botha converted. Following some poor tackling, John Timu scored for the All Blacks, with the try again being converted by Fox. In the last 5 minutes of the match, South Africa scored two tries from Pieter Muller and Gerber with both being converted by Botha with the last kick of the game to make the final score 27–24.|$|E
5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain.

This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to <b>try</b> <b>for</b> those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

5|$|Geen got {{his second}} try after another break from Poulton. Cambridge {{meanwhile}} scored two tries and at half-time were leading 15–13. Fifteen {{minutes into the}} second half, a second <b>try</b> <b>for</b> Cambridge put them five points ahead. An injury to one of Cambridge's scoring wings reduced the team to fourteen players; a forward moved to cover the wing, giving Oxford an advantage in the forwards. Poulton capitalised on it: he scored from a dummy pass to Geen; and ran in a solo try after receiving a pass from flyhalf Freddie Knott. The end score was 23–18 to Oxford.|$|E

While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise.

5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race.

Queensland responded soon after with an unconverted try, and then, after some fast play, scored a second try, this one converted to put the visitors ahead 4–8. Verge then kicked a penalty goal to bring the difference to one point. The second half was a demonstration of good attacking play and strong defensive work on both sides. The only points scored were from a <b>try</b> <b>for</b> Queensland, giving them a 7–11 win.|$|E
5|$|Bernhard Mahler {{supported}} his son's ambitions for a music career, and {{agreed that the}} boy should <b>try</b> <b>for</b> {{a place at the}} Vienna Conservatory. The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein, and accepted for 1875–76. He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes {{at the end of each}} of his first two years. For his final year, 1877–78, he concentrated on composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn. Few of Mahler's student compositions have survived; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them. He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end-of-term competition, after its scornful rejection by the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors. Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory's student orchestra, in rehearsals and performances, although it appears that his main role in this orchestra was as a percussionist.|$|E
5|$|Christie was {{promoted}} to rear admiral {{as part of his}} move back to Newport. In January 1943, however, Rear Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarines, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was killed in a plane crash. Christie hoped to get the position but the job went to Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, and the Bureau of Personnel selected Christie to take over Lockwood's old command. Christie lobbied Vice Admiral Arthur 'Chips' Carpender, Douglas MacArthur's Commander Allied Naval Forces, to allow him to replace Fife as commander of the larger submarine force at Brisbane. Carpender refused, and Christie went on to Fremantle. Nevertheless, Christie continued to <b>try</b> <b>for</b> some time to take the Brisbane force under his control.|$|E

5|$|Hayward did {{his initial}} naval {{training}} at the Naval Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. He was encouraged by the Chaplain, Father John J.

Brady arranged for Hayward {{to be sent to}} the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During World War I, some one-hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had been set aside for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still had passed the entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926, and was commissioned as an ensign on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406.|$|E
5|$|He had his {{breakout}} {{game for}} the New Zealand club in the round 18 48-0 victory over the Parramatta Eels. Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against the feed. The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the short side where he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant <b>try</b> <b>for</b> captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle breaks, a try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly put him on the map in the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether he was worth the big money.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Geen was {{approached}} by Barbarian F.C., an invitational touring rugby team based in England, to join them on their 1911 Easter tour.

Despite missing the Swansea game two days later, Geen returned to the Barbarians squad to face Cheltenham, which ended in a 8–3 victory for the tourists. Later that year Geen was again invited {{to play for the}} Barbarians, another contest against Cardiff in their traditional Boxing Day encounter. In 1912 Geen played in his first Barbarians match outside Wales, facing the Leicester Tigers. His captain on that day was England international Edgar Mobbs, and although finishing on the losing side, Geen scored his first and only <b>try</b> <b>for</b> the Barbarians.|$|E
