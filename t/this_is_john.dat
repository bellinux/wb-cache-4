25|$|Warhol {{designed}} many album {{covers for}} various artists {{starting with the}} photographic cover of John Wallowitch's debut album, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>John</b> Wallowitch!!! (1964). He designed the cover art for The Rolling Stones' albums Sticky Fingers (1971) and Love You Live (1977), and the John Cale albums The Academy in Peril (1972) and Honi Soit in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of Aretha Franklin for the cover of her 1986 gold album Aretha, which {{was done in the}} style of the Reigning Queens series he had completed the year before.|$|E
2500|$|One {{aspect of}} {{writing about the}} meaning of {{humanity}} is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society, as in Blade Runner. Perhaps the clearest example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Brunner's 1968 novel Into the Slave Nebula, where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human. More recently, the androids Bishop and Annalee Call in the films Aliens and Alien Resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an [...] "Other".|$|E

[Footnote 6: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Marten, {{the author}} of two treatises on the gout, and a [...] "Treatise of all the Degrees and Symptoms of the Venereal Disease" [...] (1708?-9). His notoriety brought on him the ire of a [...] "licens'd {{practitioner}} in physick and surgery," [...] one J. Spinke, who, in a pamphlet entitled [...] "Quackery Unmask'd" [...] (1709), dealt Marten some most uncourteous blows. From the pamphlet, it is difficult to judge whether Spinke or Marten were the greater quack; we should judge the former. Certainly Marten deserves our sympathy, if only for Spinke's virulence.

Talk about love of Christ! Who believes it? Don't see much love of Christ where I go. Your Christians hit a fellow that's down as hard as anybody. It's everybody for himself and devil take the hindmost.

60|$|There is {{at least}} one recent historian, however, whose style gives {{distinction}} to his work and makes it worthy of especial notice. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Fiske (1842-1901), whose field and method are both unusual. He began as a student of law and philosophy, and his first notable book, Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy, attracted instant attention in England and America by its literary style and rare lucidity of statement. It was followed by a series of essays, such as The Idea Of God, The Destiny Of Man and The Origin of Evil, which were so far above others of their kind that for a time they were in danger of becoming popular. Of a thousand works occasioned by the theory of evolution, when that theory was a nine days' wonder, they are among the very few that {{stand the test of time}} by affording as much pleasure and surprise as when they were first written.|$|E
6000|$|That book {{interests}} me--fascinates me--and yet I wish I {{could join}} heartily in that chorus of praise which the kind-hearted old bully has enjoyed. It {{is difficult to}} follow his own advice and to [...] "clear one's mind of cant" [...] upon the subject, for when you have been accustomed {{to look at him}} through the sympathetic glasses of Macaulay or of Boswell, it is hard to take them off, to rub one's eyes, and to have a good honest stare on one's own account at the man's actual words, deeds, and limitations. If you try it you are left with the oddest mixture of impressions. How could one express it save that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Bull taken to literature--the exaggerated John Bull of the caricaturists--with every quality, good or evil, at its highest? Here are the rough crust over a kindly heart, the explosive temper, the arrogance, the insular narrowness, the want of sympathy and insight, the rudeness of perception, the positiveness, the overbearing bluster, the strong deep-seated religious principle, and every other characteristic of the cruder, rougher John Bull who was the great grandfather of the present good-natured Johnnie.|$|E
