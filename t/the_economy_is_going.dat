40|$|The {{greatest}} {{obstacle to}} {{sound economic policy}} is not entrenched special interests or rampant lobbying, but the popular misconceptions, irrational beliefs, and personal biases held by ordinary voters. This is economist Bryan Caplan's sobering assessment in this provocative and eye-opening book. Caplan argues that voters continually elect politicians who either share their biases or else pretend to, resulting in bad policies winning again and again by popular demand. Boldly calling into question our most basic assumptions about American politics, Caplan contends that democracy fails precisely because it does what voters want. Through an analysis of Americans' voting behavior and opinions {{on a range of}} economic issues, he makes the convincing case that noneconomists suffer from four prevailing biases: they underestimate the wisdom of the market mechanism, distrust foreigners, undervalue the benefits of conserving labor, and pessimistically believe <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> from bad to worse. Caplan lays out several bold ways to make democratic government work better [...] for example, urging economic educators to focus on correcting popular misconceptions and recommending that democracies do less and let markets take up the slack. The Myth of the Rational Voter takes an unflinching look at how people who vote under the influence of false beliefs ultimately end up with government that delivers lousy results.

House prices in January 2013 were up 10 % year over year according to CoreLogic, and permits for new residential construction were up 17 % in March 2013 compared to the previous year. Heightened focus on housing is warranted because it tends to be a great leading indicator of where <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> (Leamer (2007)). Many have pointed to the recovery in housing as major positive for U. S. economic activity going forward.

40|$|Purpose – Market-timing {{skills of}} fund {{managers}} {{are an important}} issue for both mutual fund investors and researchers. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the market-timing skills and determinants of performance of sector funds across business cycles to see whether sector fund managers exhibit different market-timing abilities across business cycle. Design/methodology/approach – Single factor, five-factor conditional and five-factor unconditional models were used to estimate the initial results for market timing of sector funds across the business cycle. Monthly data such as returns, Fama and French factors, and fund specific variables of sector funds from January 1990 to December 2005 were used to estimate initial and cross-sectional results. Cross-sectional analyses were done using two approaches: the traditional approach where alpha, the dependent variable, is estimated assuming that betas of predicting variables remain constant over time, and where alpha is estimated assuming that betas do change over time. Estimated alpha was estimated as a function of fund specific variables to examine which fund specific variables influence fund abnormal performance across the overall, recessionary, and expansionary periods. Findings – The benchmark used in the analysis (S&P vs sector specific) was shown to greatly influence the results. Sector funds demonstrate positive timing ability during recessions and negative timing ability during expansions when using the S&P 500 as the benchmark, but this timing ability disappears when sector specific benchmarks are used. As a whole, sector funds exhibit significant negative timing ability across all stages of the business cycle. When using the more appropriate industry specific benchmarks, only the utility sector demonstrates significant timing ability over both stages of the business cycle. Research limitations/implications – Only two recessions are observed over the period of study. More recession periods would have given a clearer picture of findings across business cycle. Practical implications – This paper offers readers an insight into the market-timing abilities of sector fund managers across the business cycles. Investors can use the findings of this paper to develop hedging strategies especially when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> through recession. Originality/value – This paper covers the longest period of sector funds market timing and is the only one that evaluates sector funds across business cycle.

40|$|The Liberal Party now has {{a chance}} to modernise, writes JUDITH BRETT JOHN HOWARD’s {{greatest}} legacy will be the size of his defeat. This will set in train consequences which will change the Liberal Party and the country. The Liberal Party is now out of power everywhere, and it will have to rebuild. Without Howard’s social conservatism sitting like a capstone on the party, it can modernise, to open out to a much wider range of social and cultural ideas and to bring in a new generation of politicians. The country can move forward on the republic and reconciliation, the two items that have been on hold since Paul Keating’s defeat. The Liberal Party in government has always been focused on the leader, and so after a long period of government under a successful leader it is inevitably weakened - as it was after Menzies’ retirement and Fraser’s defeat. It takes time for the next election-winning leader to emerge. We now know it will not be the risk averse Peter Costello. But our system of government depends on two viable parties of government, so the Liberal Party will revive. The size of the defeat will give confidence to the forces for change in the party. Second, the Senate has been saved. Neither the government nor the opposition will control the Senate. Howard’s deal with Meg Lees to push through the GST after the 1998 election {{was the beginning of the}} end of the Democrats. They lost half their number in 2004, and now the rest are gone. The Democrats are largely responsible for the revival of the Senate since the early 1980 s, restoring its function as a house of review in which legislation can be scrutinised and committees can investigate the actions of the executive. In 2004 the government won control of the Senate for the first time since 1983. Howard used this to push through the Work Choices legislation. I believe that this legislation is the main (though not the only) reason for the Coalition’s defeat. If Howard had won control of the Senate in 1996 much of what he introduced in 2005 would have been introduced in the first term. He would not have had to negotiate with the Democrats, to introduce the no-disadvantage test, nor soften the changes to the unfair dismissal laws. He could well have been a one-term government. On Saturday Australians voted to deny the government control of the Senate, because they have seen what happens when the government controls both houses. Howard’s second legacy is to the Australian people’s understanding of the importance of the Senate. Third, we now know that many Australians think about more than their hip pockets. A government has been defeated when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> well. I always thought this was possible. (Chifley lost the 1949 election despite the economy being about as good as could be expected in those early postwar years.) But almost no one else did: not the Liberal Party who could not believe that it would be thrown out in a time of near full employment; and certainly not the press gallery, who spent most of the year in denial about what the polls were telling them. By campaigning so narrowly on his record of economic management, and losing so decisively, Howard’s third legacy is to remind us that politics has always been about more than the economy. Fourth, climate change is now at the centre of the government agenda. After Work Choices, climate change is the reason Howard lost. His is probably the first incumbent government in the world to have been defeated in part because of denial on climate change. To be sure he made a late change of direction early in the year, and started to introduce piecemeal measures, but he has cost Australia 10 years of wasted opportunity to prepare ourselves for a very difficult future, and he has cost us a great deal of our international reputation through his recalcitrance on Kyoto. High and Dry, by the Liberal Party insider Guy Pearse, shows just how much Howard was personally responsible for the government’s position on climate change. Many Liberals have been waiting for him to go so the party can develop a more responsible policy. Expect a flood of people joining the former NSW Liberal leader, Peter Debnam, who last week criticised Howard’s position on Kyoto and dismissed his support for clean coal and nuclear energy. And expect to find out what Malcolm Turnbull really thinks. • Judith Brett teaches politics at La Trobe University.
