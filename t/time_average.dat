40|$|Abstract. <b>Time</b> <b>averaging</b> {{interferometry}} is {{an experimental}} technique widely applied {{in different areas}} of optical engineering. Typical example is an application of <b>time</b> <b>averaging</b> techniques {{for the analysis of}} fringes produced by a moiré grating formed on the surface of oscillating elastic structure. Unfortunately, <b>time</b> <b>averaged</b> moiré produces blurred images. Therefore, special digital image filtering is to be used for highlighting the pattern of <b>time</b> <b>averaged</b> fringes. Such a procedure is essential for the investigation of dynamical systems with non-harmonic motion as the produced moiré pattern is particularly blurred. This paper proposes some techniques for the sharpening of fringes in <b>time</b> <b>averaged</b> moiré patterns...|$|R

In this paper we relate {{the notion of}} statistical attractor {{to that of the}} essential ω-limit set and prove some elementary results about these. In addition, we consider the convergence of <b>time</b> <b>averages</b> along trajectories. Ergodicity implies the convergence of <b>time</b> <b>averages</b> along almost all trajectories for all continuous observables. For non-ergodic systems, <b>time</b> <b>averages</b> may not exist even for almost all trajectories. However, averages of some observables may converge; we characterize conditions on observables that ensure convergence of <b>time</b> <b>averages</b> even in non-ergodic systems...|$|R

25|$|The {{concepts}} of ergodicity and the ergodic hypothesis {{are central to}} applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the <b>time</b> <b>average</b> of their properties {{is equal to the}} average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).|$|E
25|$|Another study {{compared}} nineteen {{children with}} a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the <b>time</b> (<b>average</b> age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls. Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the late onset (average IQ 100) and control groups (average IQ 106), while the late onset ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} a joint {{central limit theorem}} for customer and <b>time</b> <b>averages</b> by applying a martingale central limit theorem in a Markov framework. The limiting values of the two averages appear in the translation terms. This central limit theorem helps to construct confidence intervals for estimators and perform statistical tests. It thus helps determine which finite average is a more asymptotically efficient estimator of its limit.

40|$|The {{asymptotic}} behavior, {{for large}} time, of the quasi-linear diabatic solutions and their local approximations is considered. A <b>time</b> <b>averaging</b> procedure is introduced which yields the averages of these solutions over time intervals which contain only large time values. A {{discussion of the}} quasi-linear diabatic solutions which is limited to those solutions that are bounded from below as functions of time is given. It is shown that as the upper limit of the <b>time</b> <b>averaging</b> interval is allowed to approach infinity the <b>time</b> <b>averaged</b> quasi-linear diabatic solutions must approach isotropy (mu-independence). The first derivative with respect to mu of these solutions is also considered. This discussion is limited to first derivatives which are bounded functions of time. It is shown that as the upper limit of the <b>time</b> <b>averaging</b> interval is allowed to approach infinity, the <b>time</b> <b>averaged</b> first derivative must approach zero everywhere in mu except at mu = 0 where it must approach a large value which is calculated. The impact of this large derivative on the quasi-linear expansion scheme is discussed. An H-theorem for the first local approximation to the quasi-linear diabatic solutions is constructed. Without <b>time</b> <b>averaging,</b> the H-theorem is used to determine sufficient conditions for the first local approximate solutions to asymptote, with increasing time, to exactly the same final state which the <b>time</b> <b>averaged</b> quasi-linear diabatic solutions must approach as discussed above...|$|R

25|$|However, the <b>time</b> <b>average</b> of a {{function}} of the form cos(ωt+k) is zero provided that ω is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that harmonic currents are a bad thing. They will increase the rms current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active power factor correction circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.|$|E

2500|$|A {{central concern}} of ergodic theory is the {{behavior}} of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time. The first result in this direction is the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which claims that almost all points in any subset of the phase space eventually revisit the set. More precise information is provided by various ergodic theorems which assert that, under certain conditions, the <b>time</b> <b>average</b> of a function along the trajectories exists almost everywhere and is related to the space average. Two of the most important theorems are those of Birkhoff (1931) and von Neumann which assert the existence of a <b>time</b> <b>average</b> along each trajectory.
