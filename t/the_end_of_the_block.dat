500|$|During the Victorian period, {{the art of}} book {{illustration}} gained popularity, supported {{through the}} work of wood engravers. Woodcut extended back centuries in Europe and further in Asia. Typically the parts to be printed in black were left in relief by the carver, allowing illustrations to be printed along with the text. Thomas Bewick developed the technique in the 18th century and [...] "perfected the process that was used extensively throughout the 19th century, which necessitated the use of hardwood blocks and tools for metal engraving". The preferred method of relief engraving had been {{to work with the}} grain on the plank side of a block; however Bewick worked <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> and carved against the grain using a burin. Bewick passed his techniques to apprentices, including Landells, who in turn passed them to Evans. In the 1860s, Thomas Bolton developed a method for transferring a photographic image onto block, which enabled the engraver [...] "to work on the surface".|$|E
2500|$|The {{plan was}} to have the nine {{children}} arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth {{to be the first to}} take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford’s family were not informed of the meeting, and didn’t know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her hand. As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted “Two, four, six, eight, we ain’t gonna integrate.” Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob, but was denied entrance. Eckford ran to a bus bench at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> Eckford described her experience: ...|$|E
