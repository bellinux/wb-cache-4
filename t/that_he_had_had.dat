Condit, a married man who represented the congressional district in which the Levy family resided, at first denied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> an affair with her. Though police stated that Condit was not a suspect, Levy's family said they felt Condit was being evasive and possibly hiding information about the matter.|$|E

However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed.

5|$|Hunt's first successes {{were in the}} oilfields of Arkansas, but he {{lost most}} of his fortune by {{the outset of the}} Depression as {{overproduction}} depleted his fields and his speculation on land and oil drained his resources. He joined in Columbus Joiner's venture which opened the East Texas Oil Field. Hunt bought most of Joiner's interests in eastern Texas and his company, Placid Oil, owned hundreds of wells. He became established in Dallas and was labeled the richest man in the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E

He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes {{were part of}} the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{would allow}} him to retain the 11th Guards and {{suggested}} that Colonel-General N. E. Chibisov, an officer he had served under, assume his position. Bagramyan, however, commented <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a frictional relationship with Chibisov and instead nominated Lieutenant-General K. N. Galitsky. Stalin, belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coordinate harmoniously due to a conflict of holding the same rank, agreed to Bagramyan's suggestion and promoted him to the rank Army General. He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division that was taken from the 11th Guards, thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies: 11th Guards, 39th, 43rd and the 4th Shock.|$|E
5|$|Iron Maiden {{recruited}} {{yet another}} guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth. Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, {{as well as}} original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson. At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound. A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> enough with the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated. As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return and was also dismissed.|$|E

5|$|LeVert {{was named}} co-captain {{of the team}} along with Spike Albrecht. He opened the season with 9 assists against Hillsdale College on November 15, surpassing his {{previous}} career-high of five. On November 24, against Oregon, LeVert established a career high by making 11 free throws helping the team to a 7063 victory in the Legends Classic semifinal game. He posted a career-high 32 points and tied a career-high 4 steals on December 6 in an upset loss to NJIT. He posted 4 steals again against Minnesota on January 10. On January 17 against Northwestern, he reinjured the foot <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> surgery on the prior May and was lost for the season. At {{the time of his}} injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). LeVert was on crutches until early March and in a protective walking boot until early April.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E
5|$|Michigan lost to Purdue on January 3, {{by making}} only 4 second half field goals after taking an 8-point half time lead. The team {{defeated}} Penn State on January 6 with Albrecht {{in the starting}} lineup in place of Chatman. On January 10, the team wore throwback uniforms honoring the 1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team that won the 1989 NCAA Tournament. Michigan was down 49–40 with less than nine minutes remaining, before coming back to defeat Minnesota by a margin of 62–57. Michigan lost to (Receiving votes/#25) Ohio State on January 13. On January 17 Michigan defeated Northwestern, but lost LeVert for the season after he reinjured the foot <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> surgery on the prior May. In the game, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made his first start (in place of an ailing Albrecht) and made the game winning three-point shot. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). Nonetheless, the team defeated Rutgers in its first game without LeVert and with Dawkins making his first start. With LeVert absent, Walton scored 10 of the team's 15 points as it rallied from a 42–37 deficit to assume a 52–44 lead with just 32.5 seconds left. On January 24, Michigan fell to (AP #6/Coaches #5) Wisconsin in overtime after Walton, who had a team-high 17 points, scored Michigan's final seven points, including a game-tying three point shot with 1.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The game had been the featured College GameDay game of the week. On January 27 with Walton and Mark Donnal sidelined Michigan defeated Nebraska, as Irvin recorded his first career double-double, leading the team with 14 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Eventually, Walton missed final 12 of the season due to a toe injury. Due to the backcourt injuries, Dakich burned his redshirt season. Michigan finished the first half of its conference schedule with a 6–3 record.|$|E
