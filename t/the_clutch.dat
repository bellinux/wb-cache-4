5|$|Measuring , {{the eggs}} are oval, smooth and lustreless white, with small spots or blotches of red on the larger end. <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> size is {{reported}} to be two or three eggs. While there is no reliable information on incubation and feeding, it is believed that both parents are active in caring for the young. A field study by Jan Lewis and colleagues found that only females bore brood patches, suggesting they alone incubated eggs.|$|E
5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, {{often at}} the side of a river or in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> size is two eggs, {{which is}} low for such small rails. The eggs are greyish milk white dotted with brown-rufous spots and lavender-mauve spots that are {{concentrated}} around {{the apex of}} the egg. They are large for the size of the mother compared to other rails, and resemble the eggs of the corn crake.|$|E
5|$|The egg size is {{independent}} of <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> size and the nest site, but may vary between different females. The female incubates for 17–18days before the altricial downy chicks are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. The female broods the newly hatched chicks for around ten days, and then both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The chicks fledge 31–41days after hatching.|$|E

5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are monogamous. The female {{produces}} {{eggs that}} are white with red or yellow markings; <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> size varies, tending {{to be larger}} for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The altricial (naked and helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the young, {{and in the case}} of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{two to five}} {{eggs that}} are white with brownish, ruddy or grey blotches {{particularly}} at the wide end. The egg size ranges from an average 20.2x14.0mm (0.80x0.55in) with a weight of 2.08g (0.073oz) for the Eurasian crag martin to 17.7x13.0mm (0.70x0.51in) with a weight of 1.57g (0.06oz) for the dusky crag martin. Both adults incubate the eggs for 13–19 days to hatching, and feed the chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24–27 days later. The fledged young continue to be fed by the parents for some time after they can fly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{typically}} {{three to five}} eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red, purple or brown. The average size of the egg is , and weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> was {{described}} as consisting of a single egg; given the bird's large size, this led to proposals that the solitaire was K-selected, which means it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental care until maturity. The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they formed crèches, that may have followed foraging adults {{as part of the}} learning process. A study of subfossil remains found that the carpal knob only developed after the bird reached skeletal maturity.|$|E

5|$|The {{open cup}} nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against {{potential}} predators, sometimes including humans or cats. <b>The</b> <b>clutch,</b> typically {{of three to}} five eggs, is incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, {{although there has been}} a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E

5|$|Egg laying {{dates and}} clutch size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcap}} breeds {{in much of}} Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its preferred {{habitat is}} mature deciduous woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers {{as well as other}} blackcaps. The nest is a neat cup, built low in brambles or scrub, and <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is typically 4–6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11days. The chicks fledge in 11–12days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The blackcap is a partial migrant; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some German birds have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, {{for the rest of the}} year, blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit. Garden birds also eat bread, fat and peanuts in winter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E
