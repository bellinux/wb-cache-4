5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>is</b> a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E

In this issue we take <b>the</b> <b>media</b> apart bit by bit, ask questions of the pieces, and put them back together in the hope of seeing <b>the</b> <b>media</b> with different eyes. We’ve not only looked at how <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> made, but who makes <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> how and why we consume so much, what <b>the</b> <b>media</b> teach us about ourselves and others, and what impact <b>the</b> <b>media</b> have on our society and the world.

40|$|In {{the age of}} information, {{with the}} {{development}} of new technologies, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> playing more significant roles in political and economic activities in societies. Nowadays, the public are used to get political and social information from different <b>media</b> outlets; <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> deeply influencing people's life and behaviour. We found that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> not completely free and independent in any society; they are controlled by different powers or groups in different political regimes. In some countries, <b>media</b> <b>are</b> controlled indirectly by private corporations; in other countries, <b>media</b> <b>are</b> controlled directly by the government. In this thesis, we introduce the important role of media for maintaining democracy, the relationship between politics and media, and in what degree <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> influencing political regimes in different countries. We take the United States and People's Republic of China as representatives of democratic regime and authoritarian regime, in order to conduct research more efficiently...|$|R

5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> <b>is</b> a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.|$|E

25|$|Subjects out {{of bounds}} for journalists include discussions of democracy, the {{legitimacy}} of the regime, political corruption, HIV/AIDS, the aftermath of natural disasters and the national football team losing, though some attempt to hide criticism amongst words or images. Because <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>is</b> restricted from reporting negative events in this way, it can often be unreliable. Words by Aung San Suu Kyi are rarely covered in the media. Similarly, references to the United Nations are rare, as the junta views the organisation of trying to overthrow the regime.|$|E

The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids.

BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.|$|E

These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to see beyond the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision. Cases are decided by majority vote of the Justices. It is the Court's practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular Term {{by the end of}} that Term. Within that Term, however, the Court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument. At {{the conclusion}} of oral argument, the Justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied, and the most senior Justice in the majority assigns the initial draft of the Court's opinion to a Justice on his or her side. Drafts of the Court's opinion, as well as any concurring or dissenting opinions, circulate among the Justices until the Court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case. Since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the United States Supreme Court Building, the delivery of the decision to <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>is</b> done via paper copies and is known as the Running of the Interns.|$|E
