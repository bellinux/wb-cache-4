Two strong seasons, {{including}} three further centuries, saw Wiener selected <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> ODI debut as an opening batsman in December 1979 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against England and the West Indies. He struggled, scoring 7 and 27 respectively. Despite this he was selected to make his Test cricket debut against England at the WACA a few days later. He made 11 in the first innings before being run-out while batting with captain Greg Chappell, before scoring 58 in the second innings as Australia won the match. He played in four tests that summer (two each against England and the West Indies) before being omitted {{for the rest of}} the series. Wiener played in five further ODIs in the Australian season, with his best performances being a 33 and 50 against the West Indies in Sydney in the final two group matches. Averaging only twenty, he was dropped from the ODI team for the finals and ended his ODI career with a slow strike rate of only 42.|$|E
500|$|Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a human-terminator hybrid experiment. Worthington {{compared}} Marcus to Dorothy Gale and Alice due {{to being}} [...] "this person {{waking up in}} another world [...] tries to find himself". Terminator creator James Cameron personally recommended Worthington (whom he directed in Avatar) to McG. Russell Crowe also recommended him to McG. The director decided Worthington looked tougher than the [...] "great many of today's [...] young male actors". Worthington recalled Cameron told him [...] "the Terminator <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> {{the one with the}} war". Worthington tore his intercostal muscles during the first weeks of filming but nevertheless insisted on performing his own stunts. McG once expressed interest in casting Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis or Josh Brolin in the part. Brolin did talk to Bale and read a draft of the screenplay, which he found [...] "interesting and dark; ultimately, though, I didn't think it felt right".|$|E

She informs Will {{that the members of}} New Directions are woefully ignorant about sex. He invites her to teach the glee club about safe sex, and she performs a rendition of Joan Jett's [...] "Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)", much to the chagrin of the new head of the celibacy club, guidance counselor Emma (Jayma Mays). Holly advises Puck and Lauren (Ashley Fink) that the sex tape they plan <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> illegal, as both are minors, and helps Brittany (Heather Morris) and Santana (Naya Rivera) start {{to come to terms with}} their true feelings for each other, later performing [...] "Landslide" [...] with them in front of the club. When Emma's choice of [...] "Afternoon Delight" [...] as an abstinence song reveals her sexual naivete, her husband Carl (John Stamos) asks Holly for an appointment for him and Emma to work out issues in their sex life. During the counseling session, he reveals that Emma is still a virgin, and in answer to a question from Holly, Emma admits that she may still have feelings for Will. At the end of the episode, Holly begins a relationship with Will.|$|E

He seems to think that the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and that everybody else should keep out. As a matter of fact he has played the Nationalist game and they have played his.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band has}} been {{categorized}} under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music {{has evolved over}} most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in [...] "Streets", which shows a punk rock style, and [...] "Warmness on the Soul", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: [...] "When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after {{that is going to be}} all singing'." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> not one of them." ...|$|E
