Talking of that, what about those {{hygienic}} corset advertisements that Vines & Jackson want us to put in the window? I told Vines <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> decent and we couldnt shew them in our shop. I was pretty high with him.

Not one of them has as much brains in his whole body as Bentley has in his little finger. Besides, theyve no distinction. It's as much as I can do to tell one from the other. They wouldnt even have money if <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> the sons of their fathers, like Johnny. Whats a girl to do? I never met anybody like Bentley before. He may be small; but hes the best of the bunch: you cant deny that.|$|E
60|$|BLANCO [Forcibly] No: {{thats where}} youre wrong. Dont flatter yourselves that youre miserable sinners. Am I a miserable sinner? No: I'm a fraud and a failure. I started {{in to be}} a bad man like the rest of you. You all started in to be bad men or you wouldn't be in this jumped-up, jerked-off, hospital-turned-out camp that calls itself a town. I took the broad path because I thought I was a man and not a snivelling canting turning-the-other-cheek {{apprentice}} angel serving his time in a vale of tears. They talked Christianity to us on Sundays; but when they really meant business they told us never to take a blow without giving it back, and to get dollars. When they talked the golden rule to me, I just looked at them as if <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> there, and spat. But when they told me to try to live my life so that I could always look my fellowman straight in the eye and tell him to go to hell, that fetched me.|$|E

Before, <b>they</b> really <b>werent.</b> <b>They</b> play such {{an important part in}} the music business. The next is the live show. But the first they ever see of you is the video." [...] Describing Jackson on the set of the video, journalist David Ritz said [...] "Janet Jacksons mood seems retiring, but underneath, like so much else about her, theres more than meets the eye. For hours she obliges the camera during a grueling photography session on a sun-soaked day at the Pasadena Power Plant, a central locale for her black-and-white-dance video, a mysterious and metaphorical work dramatizing the concerns of Rhythm Nation." [...] Jacksons clothes were considered to reflect [...] "a quiet sadness," [...] being [...] "cooperative to a fault, yet inwardly shy." ...|$|R

The {{strength}} of a chain is no greater than its weakest link; but the greatness of a poet is the greatness of his greatest moment. Shakespear used to get drunk. Frederick the Great ran away from a battle. But it was what they could rise to, not what they could sink to, that made them great. <b>They</b> <b>werent</b> good always; but they were good on their day. Well, on my day--on my day, mind you--I'm good for something too. I know that Ive made a silly exhibition of myself here. I know I didnt rise to the occasion. I know that if youd been my mother, youd have been ashamed of me. I lost my presence of mind: I was a contemptible coward. But [slapping himself on the chest] I'm not the man I was then. This is my day. Ive seen the tenth possessor of a foolish face carried out kicking and screaming by a woman. [To Percival] You crowed pretty big over me. You hypnotized me. But when you were put through the fire yourself, you were found wanting. I tell you straight I dont give a damn for you.|$|E

5000|$|The S.P.A.M. bands, {{most notably}} Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits, had been {{rejected}} by the punk scene for what, to their minds, were superficial differences in dress and musical style.

50|$|Author Tim Harford {{has written}} that the {{pioneering}} tactics employed by 3rd ACR led to the first success in overcoming the Iraqi insurgency. Prior to 2005, tactics included staying out of dangerous urban areas except on patrols, with US forces returning to their bases each night. These patrols had little success in turning back the insurgency because local Iraqis who feared retaliation would very rarely assist in identifying them to US forces. McMaster deployed his soldiers into Tal Afar on a permanent basis, and once the local population grew confident that <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> going to withdraw nightly, the citizens began providing information on the insurgents, enabling US forces to target and defeat them.|$|E
50|$|According to {{authorities}} in Townsville, {{the weather had}} been windy and the sea had been rough between {{the time that the}} Kaz II departed and was found drifting. This led authorities to speculate that the crew may have experienced some form of sudden difficulty during rough weather and gone overboard. However, one issue with this theory is that contents of the cabin, including a table, did not seem to have been disrupted in any way. Relatives of the missing men say that the boats condition make this unlikely and point to discrepancies such as the fact that the mens fishing lines and laundry were set out, and that their life jackets were still stowed, which indicated that <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> experiencing rough weather {{at the time of their}} disappearance.|$|E
50|$|Wilton {{and drummer}} Scott Rockenfield had written songs for albums such as American Soldier and Dedicated to Chaos that the bands former lead singer Geoff Tate {{discarded}} {{in favor of}} songs he wrote with outside writers such as Jason Slater. These backlog demos were not used on Queensrÿche, because of the bands renewed inspiration {{and a desire to}} start off fresh. Furthermore, the writing sessions for Queensrÿche had resulted in at least 17 potential demos. Several of these songs didnt make it onto the record, as <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> quite finished, and time constraints prevented them from maturing in time, but they would be featured on the follow-up album. In addition to the existing demos, the band also wrote new songs for the album, which they announced in many interviews from very early on.|$|E

And I think it is our duty as a government to protect government officials and important people in our society against being used as tools in this blackmail. Now, you dont agree to this but I am sure that once again with hindsight, you would probably have found it preferable if Mr. Cross and Mr. Laporte had been protected from kidnapping, which <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> because these steps were taking now werent taken.

50|$|Luggage Repack: Immediately {{after the}} Rescue Jump, {{the players were}} told to prepare to take a plan to trip to Gold Coast.

Each kilogram that they unpacked from the bags was worth $100 for the kitty. Some of the items that were discarded became important as the season went forward, such as Thaos Elmo doll and Joes bodybuilding food. The men removed 40 kilos from the womens bags, and the women removed 44 kilos from the mens. This was rounded up to $9,000 total winnings.|$|E

Lanning later explained that in 1997 during Oddysees production, men in the video game industry were seen as making toys, and not taken seriously. Men were [...] "happy to make a living, but <b>they</b> <b>werent</b> necessarily going out and bragging about it".

In October 1982 they then gave their first public performance, as a support act for Blue Rondo à la Turk at Manchesters The Ritz.

One played a trebly, stinging slide guitar; the other sang in an anguished, world-weary voice. John D. wondered how it was that these two looked so young yet played with so much experience. Needless to say, he was very interested in the group, which called themselves the Allman Joys. Allman was the surname of the two blond brothers, Duane and Gregg, who led the band. Although hed never produced before, Loudermilk decided to take the group into the studio and cut some sides on them.|$|E
