40|$|Following the “historic agreement” at COP 21 – {{including}} {{the agreement to}} limit temperature increases to 1. 5 °C above pre-industrial levels - the EU must continue to reduce the level of observed discrepancy between official and real- world vehicle emissions. This {{can be achieved by}} improving the <b>type-approval</b> <b>process</b> ({{including the}} introduction of Real-World Driving legislation), and correcting the inefficient in-use compliance, enforcement, and maintenance program. This can be achieved in three steps:￼￼ 1. Independent Type Approval 2. In-use conformity testing 3. Inspection & Maintenance At COP 22, the EU can work towards these goals by negotiations with the principle manufacturing nations in an attempt to deepen the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure and with the U. S. to further its Inspection & Maintenance program...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} summarises the work {{carried out by}} the European Commission's Joint Research Centre to {{estimate}} the impact of the introduction of the new type approval procedure, the Worldwide Light duty vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), on the European car fleet CO 2 emissions. To this aim, a new method for the calculation of the European light duty vehicle fleet CO 2 emissions, combining simulation at individual vehicle level with fleet composition data is adopted. The method builds on the work carried out in the development of CO 2 MPAS, the tool developed by the Joint Research Centre to allow the implementation of European Regulations 1152 and 1153 / 2017 (which set the conditions to amend the European CO 2 targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles due to the introduction of the WLTP in the European vehicle <b>type-approval</b> <b>process).</b> Results show an average WLTP to NEDC CO 2 emissions ratio in the range 1. 1 - 1. 4 depending on the powertrain and on the NEDC CO 2 emissions. In particular the ratio tends to be higher for vehicles with lower NEDC CO 2 emissions in all powertrains, the only exception being with the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In this case, indeed, the WLTP to NEDC CO 2 emissions ratio quickly decreases to values that can be also lower than 1 as the electric range of the vehicle increases. JRC.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{outstanding}} features of making politics in a shrinking world and interdependent economies {{is the creation of}} "International Policy Regimes" (IPR) for the governance of "micro" arenas of international politics. This is a stimulating development for comparative public policy analysts as it enables (and requires) us to extend our traditional cross-national, cross-sectorial and cross-issue analyses so as to include also a cross-international analysis. This paper compares two international policy regimes for the regulation of international competition in the sector of telecommunications. The first regime deals with the regulation of terminal equipment (<b>type-approval</b> <b>processes)</b> and the second with network interconnection (the integration of different and competing networks into one system). While the terminal type-approval regime involves deregulation, and was found to be narrow in scope and fairly effective, the network interconnection regime involves reregulation and was fo [...] ...|$|R
