5|$|Previously, Tajikistan was {{on track}} to become a {{potential}} member of the union, having signed the treaty on the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space. However, due <b>to</b> <b>border</b> disputes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the integration process in Tajikistan has stalled.

5|$|Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan {{served as}} the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy <b>to</b> <b>Border</b> Regions of Armenia. Subsequently, he was {{appointed}} the State Minister on Defence, Security and Internal Affairs. In these positions, Sargsyan had {{a major role in}} the advance of the Armenian army. With other key commanders, he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah, a union of 5,000 war veterans, that had a great influence in Armenia's domestic politics in the post-war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan to rise in power.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. The letter is undatable. In response <b>to</b> <b>border</b> raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent {{in the shape of a}} church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
