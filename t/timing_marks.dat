500|$|No. 460 {{was moved}} from Northumberland in October 1969 to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg. Although {{a part of}} the museum, it was not owned by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until it was officially donated to the museum in December 1979, by the Penn Central Transportation Company, which {{received}} ownership when the Pennsylvania was merged with the New York Central Railroad. No. 460 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17, 1979. From 1982 to 1984, volunteers at the museum cleaned the locomotive, replaced wooden window frames and doors, applied rust inhibitor primer and repainted the metal. The locomotive's [...] "asbestos lagging" [...] was removed in 2008. A $400,000 restoration, lasting 3 to 4 years, is planned and is expected to start once an unrelated project at the museum is completed in the summer of 2011. 460 was moved into the museum restoration shops on March 17, 2010 after raising $50,000 and receiving an additional $50,000 donation. From July to August 2010, 460 was [...] "blasted" [...] to remove the several layers of lead paint from the locomotive. The blasting uncovered original <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> and stamped numbers showing that the origins of some of the parts on 460 were cannibalized from other E6s locomotives. The cosmetic restoration of the 460 was completed in October2016.|$|E

50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> is an {{indicator}} used for setting {{the timing of}} the ignition system of an engine, typically found on the crankshaft pulley (as pictured) or the flywheel, being the largest radius rotating at crankshaft speed and therefore the place where marks at one degree intervals will be farthest apart.|$|R
50|$|A {{crank sensor}} is an {{electronic}} device {{used in an}} internal combustion engine, both petrol and diesel, to monitor the position or rotational speed of the crankshaft. This information is used by engine management systems to control the fuel injection or the ignition system timing and other engine parameters.

40|$|The {{ambulatory}} electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder {{has been}} in existence {{for more than two}} decades. It is used to document the transient electrocardiographic events in a patient over a protracted period. The conventional ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder, including the advanced ones, can only operate for 24 hours or so due to the memory storage constraints. In certain cases, a longer recording period is required in order to capture the symptoms that don't occur during the 24 -hour recording cycle. This thesis deals with the development of a prolonged ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder that is capable of operating for three days and recording two channels of electrocardiographic data in a continuous fashion. Practicability is given first priority in design. To minimize the cost of this instrument, a tape storage technique has been employed in this project. Generally, the operating time of an ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder is restricted by the length of tape. The technology developed in this project superimposes the <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> onto the electrocardiographic data and lets the tape move in two directions so that the track on the tape surface previously occupied by the <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> is utilized for storage of the electrocardiographic data. In this manner, the memory size is doubled and the desired operating time can be achieved. To ensure portability and adequate power life, a switchmode dc-dc voltage converter is employed. As a result, the number of batteries needed for operation is made desirably few. To implement the design, a portable auto-reverse music player (Sony ·Walkman) was purchased and modified into an ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder. The ambulatory ECG recorder developed in this project was tested on a subject as well as on two patients at the Royal University Hospital. The results show that it is capable of operating for as long as three days and the recorded data are very close to the original ECG signal in shape...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Compression {{pressure}} of individual cylinder and valve timing have big influence on combustion pressure, indicated {{mean effective pressure}} (IMEP), emission, vibration, combustion noise and many other combustion parameters. Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and valve timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost. To check valve timing, related FEAD parts should be disassembled and <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> should be checked manually. This study describes and suggests new methodology to measure compression pressure by analysis of start motor current and to check valve timing by cylinder pressure with high accuracy.

50|$|The damper will {{be fitted}} {{at the front}} of the engine (opposite the clutch or transmission) just beyond the cover of the timing chain, gears, or belt, and behind the {{accessory}} drive pulley (which may carry one or more V, serpentine or cogged belts. In older vehicles the pulley and damper were separate units that were bolted together. In late model vehicles the two have been combined into one unit. <b>Timing</b> <b>marks</b> are almost always engraved for purposes of setting the ignition timing.|$|E
50|$|The term {{can also}} be used to {{describe}} the tick marks along the length of an optical mark recognition sheet, used to confirm the location of the sheet as it passes through the reader. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,218,439 (filed 1964, granted 1965), which refers to a timing track down the left side of the form, and U.S. Patent 3,267,258 (filed 1963, granted 1966), which refers to a column of <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> on the right side of the form.|$|E
50|$|On older engines it {{is common}} to set the {{ignition}} timing using a timing light, which flashes in time with the ignition system (and hence engine rotation), so when shone on the <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> makes them appear stationary due to the stroboscopic effect. The ignition timing can then be adjusted to fire at the correct point in the engine's rotation, typically a few degrees before top dead centre and advancing with increasing engine speed. The timing can be adjusted by loosening and slightly rotating the distributor in its seat.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of a stable heliospheric current sheet (HCS) structure near solar cycle maximum was questioned since the recognition that coronal mass ejections (CME's) occur in coronal helmet streamers. Evidence is presented suggesting that pre-existing helmet streamers disrupted or blown out by CME's reform in a time interval much shorter than the life time of the HCS, and {{that the concept of}} the HCS has a meaning at any time of thesolar cycle. It appears that the HCS, the current layer that separates adjacent interplanetary magnetic field regions with opposite magnetic polarity, exists throughout the solar cycle, though not always as a thin disk-like sheet. The sheet may be thickened by embedded magnetic ropes formed by CME's, especially near sunspot maximum. The HCS may be used as <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> in identifying or predicting CME's in the interplanetary medium...|$|R
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of advanced meters in residential areas has produced additional privacy issues {{that may affect}} ordinary customers. [...] These meters are often capable of recording energy usage every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. [...] Some meters {{have one or two}} IR LEDs on the front - one used for testing and which acts as the equivalent of the <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> on the older mechanical meters and the other as part of a two-way IR communications port for reading / programming the meter. These IR LEDs are visible with some night vision viewers and certain video cameras that are capable of sensing IR transmissions.

50|$|However, {{while the}} Volvo engine designs would {{externally}} {{appear to be}} a domestic Volvo, there are minor differences. The engine mounts are one example along with the oil filter mounting, power steering pump, ECU, timing belt cover and probably the gearbox setup. The camshaft pulleys were inverted by Renault making the Volvo <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> redundant. The engine must now utilise a specialist alignment tool to set up the timing however this tool can also be used on the same genuine volvo engines. The 2.5 engine is really a 2.4 being 2435cc but was rounded up by Renault.|$|E
50|$|A turning jack {{also allows}} a {{complete}} top deck and crankcase inspection {{to be performed}} by one mechanic in minutes, and inspecting the engine with the components in motion produces a better inspection. Rocker arm rollers can be inspected for proper rotation, potential valvetrain problems such as insufficient or excessive clearance can be observed, piston ring movement in the ring grooves indicating excessive groove wear can be observed, broken valvesprings can be more easily seen, and so on. A turning jack also allows the mechanic to observe the flywheel <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> while the engine is rotating to time the engine properly for maintenance or post-repair engine valve-train and fuel-system adjustments.|$|E
50|$|The {{timing light}} is {{connected}} to the ignition circuit and used to illuminate the <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> on the engine's crankshaft pulley or flywheel, with the engine running. The apparent position of the marks, frozen by the stroboscopic effect, indicates the current timing of the spark in relation to piston position. A reference pointer is attached to the flywheel housing or other fixed point, and an engraved scale gives the offset between the spark time and the top dead centre position of the piston in the cylinder. The distributor can be rotated slightly until the reference pointer aligns with the specified point on the timing scale.|$|E

5000|$|... "Timing advance" [...] {{refers to}} the number of degrees before top dead center (BTDC) that the spark will ignite the air-fuel mixture in the {{combustion}} chamber during the compression stroke. Retarded timing can be defined as changing the timing so that fuel ignition happens later than the manufacturer's specified time. For example, if the timing specified by the manufacturer was set at 12 degrees BTDC initially and adjusted to 11 degrees BTDC, it would be referred to as retarded. In a classic ignition system with breaker points, the basic timing can be set statically using a test light or dynamically using the <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> and a timing light.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced print hammers comprised a print line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} printing position, as indicated by <b>timing</b> <b>marks</b> {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|E

(The skirmish that Earl of Essex, by accident or design, confused with the Battle of Chalgrove.) The skirmishers were joined by Col.

50|$|Most {{vibration}} analysis instruments today utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) {{which is}} a special case of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform and converts the vibration signal from its time domain representation to its equivalent frequency domain representation. However, frequency analysis (sometimes called Spectral Analysis or Vibration Signature Analysis) is {{only one aspect of}} interpreting the information contained in a vibration signal. Frequency analysis tends to be most useful on machines that employ rolling element bearings and whose main failure modes tend to be the degradation of those bearings, which typically exhibit an increase in characteristic frequencies associated with the bearing geometries and constructions. Depending on the type of machine, its typical malfunctions, the bearing types employed, rotational speeds, and other factors, the CM specialist may use additional diagnostic tools, such as examination of the time domain signal, the phase relationship between vibration components and a <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> on the machine shaft (often known as a keyphasor), historical trends of vibration levels, the shape of vibration, and numerous other aspects of the signal along with other information from the process such as load, bearing temperatures, flow rates, valve positions and pressures to provide an accurate diagnosis. This is particularly true of machines that use fluid bearings rather than rolling-element bearings. To enable them to look at this data in a more simplified form vibration analysts or machinery diagnostic engineers have adopted a number of mathematical plots to show machine problems and running characteristics, these plots include the bode plot, the waterfall plot, the polar plot and the orbit time base plot amongst others.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture and achievable {{performance of a}} time-to-digital converter by cascading a time stretcher and a gated ring oscillator based time-to-digital converter (GRO-TDC). The analogue time expansion, where the time interval to be measured is stretched by a factor k, is realized by charging a capacitor with a current I followed by discharging the capacitor by a current I/k. The currents are created by wide swing cascode current source/sinks with a current ratio of k. The time stretching method involves two conversions: time to charge and then charge to time. Whereas these are performed in each individualpixel, the final time to digital conversion is performed by the global GRO-TDC, where a multiphase gated ring oscillator is {{used to measure the}} stretched time interval by counting full clock cycles and storing the states of the ring oscillator within the clock period to obtain increased resolution. A block diagram of the proposed structure is shown paper. The nine phase single ended gated ring oscillator operates as an interpolator and as a clock during charge to time conversion. The layout of the gated inverters in the oscillator is designed by placing them in an order to compensate for the parasitic loading of capacitance for each stage and to minimize the effects of process variations. The clock of the 8 -bit ripple counter is enabled {{at the start of the}} charge to time conversion by the Start-Stretch signal. The result of the counter will be ready after the clock of the counter is disabled to the counter by the Stop-Stretch <b>timing</b> <b>mark</b> from the comparator. Special attention is paid to the design of the hysteresis based comparator using positive feedback. The comparator is designed to achieve acceptable robustness against transistor mismatch, small power dissipation, offset voltage, linearity, speed, small area and good noise immunity. The digital flip-flops functioning as an interpolator will store the time interval measurement responses with in the clock cycle. By selecting an appropriate stretch factor and suitable clock frequency for the gated ring oscillator, measurement error of few cm in distance is achievable. To ensure reliable recording of the timing signals, the counter is synchronized by usinga dual edge synchronization scheme where one of the two flip-flops always has enough delay between data change and clock edge to avoidmetastability problems.

40|$|Running mean filters {{have long}} been used as time domain, digital, {{low-pass}} filters. They are a convolution in the time domain with a boxcar function (or, more generally, with functions designed for better frequency characteristics). Running means are linear and easily described by their transfer functions in the frequency domain. They handle some kinds of high-frequency contamination well. However, faced with the spikey noise sometimes affecting electronic systems and phenomena subject to interference by lightening, cosmic rays, and <b>timing</b> tick <b>marks</b> running means usually perform poorly: spikes become low, wide, one-sided pulses affecting a broad region of the signal {{in the neighborhood of}} an originally short glitch.

Unlike current solutions, which either estimate and compensate the frequency difference (skew) among clocks or introduce offset corrections that can generate jitter {{and possibly even}} backward jumps, our algorithm achieves synchronization without these problems. We first analyze the convergence property of the algorithm and provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters to guarantee syn-chronization. We then implement our solution on a cluster of IBM BladeCenter servers running Linux and experimentally study its performance. In particular, through both analytical and experimental results, we show that our algorithm can converge even {{in the presence of}} <b>timing</b> loops. This <b>marks</b> a clear contrast with current standards such as NTP and PTP, where timing loops are specifically avoided. Furthermore, timing loops can even be beneficial in our scheme.
