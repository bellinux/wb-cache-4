500|$|Truth Serum {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Anita Moran of The New Zealand Herald opined that the tracks were [...] "easy to listen to" [...] and had [...] "wide appeal". She also considered that the record was [...] "too short" [...] and that Lo's voice {{did not have}} the same intensity of Ellie Goulding's. Writing for BBC News, Mark Savage said that the EP [...] "contains more hooks than a coat rack". Furthermore, he ranked the record at number two on his list of the top ten singles of 2014, writing that, [...] "Every track hits you like a hurricane – the pop hooks deployed like rock riffs as Tove excavates her darkest secrets". Ben Oliver of We Listen Hear called it an [...] "excellent debut EP" [...] and [...] "a collection that not only showcases a sharp new talent but sets a new standard for emotional pop music". Panisch of Out noted that the singer [...] "manages <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>together</b> a warts-and-all narrative [...] with polished dance floor-ready beats". John Calvert of NME gave the extended play a mixed review; though he praised Lo's sincerity in the lyrics of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", he criticized the production of Truth Serum, writing that it is not [...] "anywhere near as boundary pushing, sonically – instead, it's dominated by anodyne, cliché-packed Scandi-pop". Tord Litleskare of the Norwegian publication Gaffa also gave the EP a mixed response, stating that the lyrics of the tracks were [...] "silly and sad" [...] and [...] "too focused on heartbreaks and drugs".|$|E

50|$|For {{the opening}} credits and {{exterior}} shots a Red Dwarf model ship {{had to be}} built from scratch. Peter Wragg was the visual effects designer of Red Dwarf; Wragg also had a large part in set building and was the chief model maker. Wragg had previously filled a similar role in British television series such as Thunderbirds Are GO, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and Doctor Who. The opening effects shot features a dissolve from Lister painting the ship to a full model shot of the city-sized vessel traveling through space.

50|$|Central to ANT is {{the concept}} of {{translation}} which is sometimes referred to as sociology of translation, in which innovators attempt to create a forum, a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists try to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops, Michel Callon has defined 4 moments of translation: problematization, interessement, enrollment and mobilisation of allies. Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>together.</b> Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work Reassembling the Social (2005).|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the automatic generation of a quadrilateral mesh with arbitrary line constraints is proposed in this paper. It is an indirect all-quad mesh generation and presented in the following steps: (1) discretizing the constrained lines within the domain; (2) converting the above domain <b>to</b> a triangular <b>mesh</b> <b>together</b> with the line constraints; (3) transforming the generated triangular mesh with line constraints <b>to</b> an all-quad <b>mesh</b> through performing an advancing front algorithm from the line constraints, which enables the construction of quadrilaterals layer by layer, and roughly keeps the feature of the initial triangular mesh; (4) optimizing the topology of the quadrilateral <b>mesh</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the number of}} irregular nodes; (5) smoothing the generated mesh toward high-quality all-quad mesh generation.

40|$|In today’s age of Web {{applications}} connected via Web services, accountability {{has become}} both crucial {{and harder to}} achieve. The management of authentication, authorization, and accountability in these applications is therefore a very important and difficult problem to solve. In this article, we describe how audit logging can be built into the Web services infrastructure. Why Web Services? Web services aim to deliver virtualization, interoperability, and reusability via technology implementations such as SOAP, serviceoriented architecture (SOA), and Representational State Transfer (REST). Interoperability in particular is paramount for enterprises that must transact business across multiple. NET, Java, open source, and mainframe platforms. Add in messaging connections to customers and partners located in different countries or organizations, and the challenges of getting protocols and message formats <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>together</b> seem overwhelming. This is the problem that Web services attempt to address. Unfortunately, however, most Web services implementations offer their own challenges as well—namely, they don’t always enable security by default, and they often leave security decisions about authentication, authorization, and audit logging to the implementer, which can cause serious long-term problems down the road. 1 Web services security has two parts: interface and implementation security and message security. Interface and implementation security uses traditional Web application security controls such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and access control lists (ACLs). For message security, XML mechanisms such as WS-Security, th...|$|E
40|$|Searching for a Stake: The Scope of Jewish Politics in Los Angeles from Watts to Rodney King, 1965 - 1992 ” {{traces the}} {{intensification}} of local Jewish political activity {{as well as the}} factors that led to Jewish disengagement from local political and civic affairs. It does so by considering Jewish politics within the context of metropolitan social structures, localized ethno-racial hierarchies, and spatial scales. An insidious sense of defeat following concerted efforts <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>together</b> distinct ethnic concerns with broader civic ones, coupled with a heightened interest in seemingly remote issues, pulled Jews away from the local sphere. Herein lies one of the great ironies of late twentieth century Jewish political life in Los Angeles and beyond: as the American Jewish community enhanced their political clout on the national and international level, they sensed little to gain by participating in local politics. This project commences during the mid- 1960 s as Jews, inspired by the rising tides of identity politics, were testing new ways to fashion themselves as a meaningful part of a diverse urban fabric. An array of Jewish leaders and activists saw local contests over electoral representation, public education, and neighborhood preservation as opportunities to wield political influence over their urban surroundings and articulate a distinct Jewish voice in local civic affairs. And yet, by the 1980 s, Jewish leaders and activists began to question how to effectively remain engaged in the local political scene. In concert with the Jewish grassroots, they began to increasingly lack confidence in the public school system as an institution responsible for the education of Jewish children and doubt their ability to stem seemingly disruptive economic development and urban growth initiatives from transforming local neighborhoods. These sources of frustration not only exacerbated pre-existing inter-and intra-group tensions, but also forced Jewish community leaders and activists to question the efficacy and responsiveness of ethnic-based political models as vehicles for substantive local activism. Seeking to affirm the political relevance of the Jewish community, various organizations looked towards international and historical issues as a means to stay engaged, though such projects ultimately propelled Jewish communal resources away from the local arena...|$|E
