40|$|The use of dimethylaminocinnemaldehyde (DMAC) as a {{fingerprint}} development reagent was first {{proposed in the}} 1970 s as a solution-dipping technique to target the urea constituent of fingerprints. However, in operational trials, the quality of developed fingerprints was poor. This was attributed to diffusion of urea with time, and the technique was not pursued. More recently, the use of DMAC fuming {{and the use of}} sheets impregnated with DMAC solution have been proposed as alternative fingerprint development processes for porous surfaces, in particular for <b>thermal</b> <b>papers.</b> This study reports an analysis of the DMAC development process using impregnated paper sheets and compares its effectiveness to other techniques proposed for <b>thermal</b> <b>papers.</b> The study concludes that the DMAC transfer process primarily targets amino acids in the fingerprint, but that these may be less persistent than the constituents targeted by ninhydrin and DFO; consequently, the effectiveness decreases more rapidly as the fingerprints age. Overall, the most effective process for <b>thermal</b> <b>papers</b> if {{it is not necessary to}} retain the text is an ethanol pre-dip followed by DFO...|$|R
25|$|A {{thermal printer}} (or direct thermal printer) {{produces}} a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.|$|E
25|$|Uneven heating in microwaved {{food can}} be {{partly due to}} the uneven {{distribution}} of microwave energy inside the oven, and {{partly due to the}} different rates of energy absorption {{in different parts of the}} food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> which allows this to be easily done at home.|$|E
25|$|BPA is {{employed}} {{to make certain}} plastics and epoxy resins. BPA-based plastic is clear and tough, and is made {{into a variety of}} common consumer goods, such as water bottles, sports equipment, CDs, and DVDs. Epoxy resins containing BPA are used to line water pipes, as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans and in making <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> such as that used in sales receipts. In 2015, an estimated 4 million tonnes of BPA chemical were produced for manufacturing polycarbonate plastic, {{making it one of the}} highest volume of chemicals produced worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|BisphenolA is a {{preferred}} color developer in {{carbonless copy paper}} and thermal point of sale receipt paper. When used in <b>thermal</b> <b>paper,</b> BPA is present as [...] "free" [...] (i.e., discrete, non-polymerized) BPA, {{which is likely to}} be more available for exposure than BPA polymerized into a resin or plastic. Upon handling, BPA in <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> can be transferred to skin, and there is some concern that residues on hands could be ingested through incidental hand-to-mouth contact. Furthermore, some studies suggest that dermal absorption may contribute some small fraction to the overall human exposure. European data indicate that the use of BPA in paper may also contribute to the presence of BPA in the stream of recycled paper and in landfills. Although there are no estimates for the amount of BPA used in <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> in the United States, in Western Europe, the volume of BPA reported to be used in <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> in 2005/2006 was 1,890 tonnes per year, while total production was estimated at 1,150,000 tonnes per year. [...] (Figures taken from 2012 EPA draft paper.) Studies document potential spreading and accumulation of BPA in paper recycling, suggesting its presence for decades in paper recycling loop even after a hypothetical ban. Epoxy resin may or may not contain BPA, and is employed to bind gutta percha in some root canal procedures.|$|E
2500|$|Besides diet, {{exposure}} {{can also}} occur through air and through skin absorption. Free BPA {{is found in}} high concentration in <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> and carbonless copy paper, which {{would be expected to}} be more available for exposure than BPA bound into resin or plastic. [...] Popular uses of <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> include receipts, event and cinema tickets, labels, and airline tickets. A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 thermal printing papers contained [...] (BPA). Upon dry finger contact with a <b>thermal</b> <b>paper</b> receipt, roughly [...] BPA (...) was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger. For wet or greasy fingers approximately [...] more was transferred. Extraction of BPA from the fingers was possible up to [...] after exposure. Further, it has been demonstrated that thermal receipts placed in contact with paper currency in a wallet for 24 hours cause a dramatic increase in the concentration of BPA in paper currency, making paper money a secondary source of exposure. Another study has identified BPA in all of the waste paper samples analysed (newspapers, magazines, office paper, etc.), indicating direct results of contamination through paper recycling. [...] Free BPA can readily be transferred to skin, and residues on hands can be ingested. Bodily intake through dermal absorption (99% of which comes from handling receipts) has been shown for the general population to be 0.219ng/kg bw/day (occupationally exposed persons absorb higher amounts at 16.3ng/kg bw/day) whereas aggregate intake (food/beverage/environment) for adults is estimated at 0.36–0.43 μg/kg bw/day (estimated intake for occupationally exposed adults is 0.043–100 μg/kg bw/day).|$|E

30|$|A {{closer look}} {{on paper and}} {{cardboard}} recycling cycles shows that endocrine disruptors are increasingly introduced into the paper cycle, for example the already mentioned BPA, by recycling used <b>thermal</b> <b>papers.</b> BPA may be subsequently detected in recycled paper and within the next product or within waste water (toilet paper). Printing inks used in newspaper printing may result in contamination of cardboard packaging for food industry and thus enter the human food chain [2].|$|R
