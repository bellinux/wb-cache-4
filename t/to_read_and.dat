40|$|This study {{explores the}} nature of teachers' {{understandings}} of theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> the relationships between theoretical orientations <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> instructional practice. The participants were eleven Grade Five classroom teachers, seven female and four male, in one particular school board in Southern Ontario. A series of three in-depth, phenomenological {{interviews were conducted with}} each teacher-participant. Utilizing the concept of theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading,</b> understandings of <b>and</b> relationships between, theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> instructional practice were identified and described by the teachers in this study, from an 'emic' (insider) perspective. The themes of teachers' knowledge and beliefs, personal experiences, and constructivist approaches to teaching and learning emerged as highly influential in determining the kinds of instructional decisions made by the teacher participants. The data illustrate how teachers with a skills orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> instruction supported a focus on explicit skills instruction within balanced, eclectic approaches <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> instruction. The results provide a multi-voice construction, showing how the teacher participants' knowledge, beliefs, personal and professional experiences were reflected not only in their efforts to articulate understandings of theoretical orientations <b>to</b> <b>reading,</b> but also in the characteristics of relationships between their theoretical orientation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> instructional practices. Patterns and themes in the data also indicate the need for improved pre-service teacher education, and relevant in-service professional development, to better meet the needs of contemporary teachers of reading at the junior division level...|$|R

5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and barely able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write. In contrast, Allen's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained {{an interest in}} learning. In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached adulthood.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of parents <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> their young children. Using Australian data we find that parental <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> children at age 4 – 5 has positive and significant effects on <b>reading</b> skills <b>and</b> cognitive skills (including numeracy skills) of these children at least up to age 10 or 11. The effects on skills more closely related <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> language are larger than those on skills such as numeracy skills. However, all findings in relation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> other cognitive skills are persistent and robust {{to a wide range}} of sensitivity analyses. Although <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> children is also correlated with children's non-cognitive skills, after accounting for the endogeneity of <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> children, no causal effect remains...|$|R

This multiple-baseline treatment alternated between oral <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> writing <b>to</b> dictation, beginning with sound-blending nonword bigraphs. As treatment accurately progressed, training shifted to two-syllable words and phrases. Outcomes demonstrated significant improvement in the patient’s ability <b>to</b> orally <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write <b>to</b> dictation.

Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him {{with a list of}} 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery. It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron-Jetté learned <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write.|$|E

30|$|There {{has been}} {{a growing number of}} {{literature}} exploring how gender explains the association between <b>reading</b> motivation <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> achievement. However, research evidence so far is far from conclusive.

Ozturk et al.’s (2016) study of 5  year old children and their parents in Australia not only rejected the gender difference in children’s attitudes to literacy, but also found that gender did not moderate the relationships between parental factors <b>and</b> children’s <b>reading</b> attitudes. Both Coddington and Guthrie (2009) and Logan and Johnston (2009) reported no association between attitude <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> achievement for girls, while Fives (2016) revealed a positive association between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> achievement for girls but not for boys.|$|R
