5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by <b>tubular</b> <b>secretion,</b> and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs.

Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal <b>tubular</b> <b>secretion.</b> Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E

In humans, soluble wastes are excreted {{primarily by the}} urinary system and, {{to a lesser extent}} in terms of urea, removed by perspiration. The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. The system produces urine by a process of filtration, reabsorption, and <b>tubular</b> <b>secretion.</b> The kidneys extract the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water, sugars, {{and a variety of other}} compounds.

Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40% tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 μg/ml or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some <b>tubular</b> <b>secretion.</b> There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. However the activity of nitrofurantoin is also pH dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased pH above 6.

40|$|The {{secretory}} {{immune system}} has been well studied in the intestinal, bronchial, and biliary systems and breast. Tissue studies of secretory immunoglobulins in the kidney are scanty, mostly related to nephropathies with IgA. Renal tissues from 37 autopsies selected for any history of renal dysfunction were processed for immunohistologic studies on frozen sections with several antisera, including a purified rabbit anti-human secretory component (SC). By immunohistology, gel diffusion, and immunoblotting, the anti-SC antibody reacted appropriately with purified human SC, saliva, intestinal epithelium, and breast milk and did not cross-react with immunoglobulin heavy or light chains, lactoferrin, and other tissue proteins. IgA and SC were seen in tubular casts in 70 % of patients, whereas less impressive staining with IgM, IgG, and albumin was seen, respectively, in 24 %, 13 %, and 22 % of the patients. SC was present in the cytoplasm of distal tubule and Henle's loop cells in 78 % of specimens. A control group of 10 healthy individuals who died suddenly showed minimal staining of casts and tubules in 2 specimens. Renal pathology in the group with IgA-SC+ casts included acute tubular necrosis (54 %), severe chronic renal disease (61 %), and mild chronic renal injury (38 %). The group with negative IgA-SC casts included acute tubular necrosis (64 %), infectious interstitial nephritis (36 %), and negligible renal disease (36 %). This study suggests that discrete distal segments of the nephron may have the capability of secreting SC, which is probably coupled with serum-derived IgA and incorporated into luminal <b>tubular</b> <b>secretions.</b> The low level of immunosecretions in kidneys which are normal or minimally damaged suggests that this system {{may need to be}} turned on by unknown, probably pathogenic stimulating factors...|$|R

SLC 22 A 2 is {{associated}} with <b>tubular</b> creatinine <b>secretion</b> and bias of estimated GFR in renal transplantation. Physiol Genomics 45 : 201 - 209, 2013. First published January 22, 2013; doi: 10. 1152 /physiolgenomics. 00087. 2012. -Genomewide association studies reported SLC 22 A 2 variants {{to be associated with}} serum creatinine. As SLC 22 A 2 encodes the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT 2), the association might be due to an effect on tubular creatinine handling. To test this hypothesis we studied the association of SLC 22 A 2 polymorphisms with phenotypes of net tubular creatinine secretion: fractional creatinine excretion (FEcreat) and bias of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We also studied the association with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and graft failure (GF) in renal transplant recipients. SLC 22 A 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs 3127573 and rs 316009, were genotyped in 1, 142 ESRD patients receiving renal transplantation and 1, 186 kidney donors as controls. GFR was measured with I- 125 -iothalamate clearance. Creatinine clearance was also assessed. FEcreat was calculated from the simultaneous clearances of creatinine and I- 125 -iothalamate. Donor rs 316009 was associated with FEcreat (beta - 0. 053, P = 0. 024) and with estimated [modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) ] but not measured GFR. In line with this, donor rs 316009 was associated with bias of the MDRD and CKD-EPI but not the Cockroft-Gault equation. Both SNPs were associated with ESRD: odds ratios [95 % CI] 1. 39 [1. 16 - 1. 67], P = 0. 00065, and 1. 23 [1. 02 - 1. 48], P = 0. 042, for rs 3127573 and rs 316009, respectively.
