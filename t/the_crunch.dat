5|$|Early in {{the second}} period <b>the</b> <b>Crunch</b> got another power play {{opportunity}} when Senators' captain Drew Bannister took a hooking penalty. The man advantage did not benefit Syracuse as the Senators tied the game 1–1 when Martin St. Pierre found an open Josh Hennessy, who put the puck past Kevin Lalande for the shorthanded goal. Binghamton seemed to be gaining the advantage {{in the second}} period outshooting <b>the</b> <b>Crunch</b> 16–9. But, with just 11.7 seconds remaining in the period, Crunch defenseman David Liffiton scored the go-ahead goal from the high slot. During the third period the score remained the same, when with just 1:30 left in the game Syracuse's Kevin Harvey took an interference penalty giving the Senators a chance to tie the game on the power play. Binghamton was unable to score in the first minute of the power play and pulled Brodeur to give them the six on four advantage. Even with the two man advantage the Senators failed to post a second goal on Lalande, who stopped 36 of the 37 shots he faced during the game helping <b>the</b> <b>Crunch</b> to the 2–1 victory. His performance earned him the first Star of the Game. The game was a penalty-filled affair with 26 infractions called on the two teams and a total of 18 power plays awarded. Neither team was able to capitalize on the opportunities, with Binghamton going 0–10 and Syracuse 0–8.|$|E
5|$|As plans {{moved forward}} the {{decision}} was made not just to play the game but make it an event celebrating New York hockey history. For the game <b>the</b> <b>Crunch</b> played their intrastate rivals the Binghamton Senators. The days before the game local youth hockey teams played on the ice, and then the day after there was a pond hockey tournament played on the rink featuring 16 local teams. The fairgrounds also featured VIP tents, fan zones, bands, and ice sculpting for the celebration, as well as appearances by former players for New York's various professional teams.|$|E

In part because of his success in putting on the event, Dolgon was awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding executive. Following the success of the Mirabito Outdoor Classic other AHL Outdoor Classics were held by other AHL teams.|$|E

Cost estimates for hosting the game were close to $1 million.

He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. <b>The</b> <b>crunch</b> issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E

The physical play continued and minutes later at the 3:29 mark Paul Baier and Mike Radja were given matching roughing minor penalties. Not long after the matching minors Mike Blunden made a pass to Alexandre Picard to send him on a breakaway. Picard became the first player to score in an Outdoor Classic when he beat Senators' goaltender Mike Brodeur putting <b>the</b> <b>Crunch</b> up 1–0.
