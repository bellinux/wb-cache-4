30|$|Since the emergent, logamediate, and {{intermediate}} expansions derive accelerating {{model of the}} universe, different types of dark energy models give {{the nature of their}} scalar field and potential in different phases of the expansion. For the emergent scenario, <b>the</b> <b>potentials</b> <b>are</b> increasing for hessence and tachyonic fields, but are decreasing for quintessence, phantom, k-essence, and DBI-essence models. For the logamediate scenario, <b>the</b> <b>potentials</b> <b>are</b> increasing for tachyon and DBI-essence models. However, in this scenario, <b>the</b> <b>potentials</b> <b>are</b> decreasing for quintessence, phantom, and k-essence models.

5000|$|Many {{times in}} the use and {{calculation}} of electric and magnetic fields, the approach used first computes an associated potential: <b>the</b> electric <b>potential,</b> '''', for <b>the</b> electric field, and <b>the</b> magnetic <b>potential,</b> A, for <b>the</b> magnetic field. <b>The</b> electric <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> a scalar field, while <b>the</b> magnetic <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> a vector field.

25|$|Every wet {{chemistry}} cell has 26 chemical sensors and a temperature sensor. The polymer Ion Selective Electrodes {{were able to}} determine the concentration of ions by measuring the change of electric potential within the sensor, which is separated from the {{wet chemistry}} cell by an ion selective membrane. The two gas sensing electrodes for oxygen and carbon dioxide work on the same principle and are separated from the wet chemistry cell by a gas permeable membrane. A gold micro-electrode array {{is used for the}} Cyclic voltammetry and Anodic Stripping Voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry is a method to study ions by applying a waveform of varying potential and measuring the current-voltage curve.

25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>is</b> applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E

[...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News said the show was not funny enough to deserve Poehler's comedic talents, and compared the dialogue to a Saturday Night Live sketch that he said could not sustain a whole sitcom.
