5|$|For centuries {{there has}} been a general market held each Friday in the Market Place. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been in decline for some years and in 2010 {{attempts}} were made to revitalise it. However, after initial interest, the number of stallholders slowly decreased. In recent months a number of suitcase traders have been supporting the market on a regular basis and this has attracted local interest.|$|E
5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been in operation since 1922. It {{is considered the}} charcuterie of the connoisseurs. Despite the Greek economic crisis, Miran is expanding its {{business and}} has doubled in size to accommodate increased demand. The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, {{is thought to be}} the man who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in the}} European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens. Miran has been in the same spot in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E

50|$|With {{the opening}} of the Merrion Centre in <b>the</b> 1960s <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>had</b> to compete with the newer but smaller Merrion Market (then Merrion Superstore). In recent years <b>the</b> Merrion <b>Markets</b> <b>have</b> {{declined}} and <b>the</b> Kirkgate <b>Markets</b> <b>have</b> regained their dominance in Leeds City Centre.|$|R

25|$|Alternative free trade. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> no {{necessary}} and natural form. If {{the market economy}} can be organized {{in a different way}} then so can a universal order of free trade among market economies.|$|E
25|$|Iron ore {{has been}} the latest {{addition}} to industrial metal derivatives. Deutsche Bank first began offering iron ore swaps in 2008, other banks quickly followed. Since then the size of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> more than doubled each year between 2008 and 2012.|$|E
25|$|Even if <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> {{characteristics}} {{that could lead}} it {{to be dominated by}} one platform, companies can choose to cooperate rather than competing to be the winner-take-it-all. For instance, DVD companies pooled their technologies creating the DVD format in 1995.|$|E

25|$|Sneinton has a {{traditional}} open-air public market {{situated at the}} north-western end of Sneinton, where the district meets the city centre. Though <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> <b>has</b> struggled in recent years due to its relative isolation amongst surrounding derelict buildings, Sneinton Dale and Sneinton Boulevard, the two main high streets through the village, have weathered the recession and are thriving. The Sneinton Business Forum represents over 160 local businesses.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} has four core players: the merchant (also known as 'retailer' or 'brand'), the network (that contains offers for the affiliate {{to choose from}} and also {{takes care of the}} payments), the publisher (also known as 'the affiliate'), and the customer. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> grown in complexity, resulting in the emergence of a secondary tier of players, including affiliate management agencies, super-affiliates and specialized third party vendors.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, after {{a decade}} of double-digit growth, DSLR (along with MILC) sales are down 15 percent. This may be due to some low-end DSLR users {{choosing}} to use a smartphone instead. The market intelligence firm IDC predicts Nikon will be out of business in five years if the trend continues. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> shifted from being driven by hardware to software, and camera manufacturers have not been keeping up.|$|E
50|$|By the 1980s and <b>the</b> 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>had</b> surpassed its {{competitors}} in Quiapo, Manila and Baclaran in popularity. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> vendor <b>had</b> attributed its growth during the Marcos era when Imelda Marcos was the First Lady with her lavish lifestyle. At that time <b>the</b> <b>market</b> provided flowers for big flower shops, {{which in turn}} decorated the Malacañang Palace.|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} sociological books on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> grown rapidly since 1989, with {{publishing}} houses specializing in sociology. Polish sociologists and their institutions have also increased participation in various international organizations and research programs.

40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} {{the evolution}} of the longevity risk transfer <b>market</b> with <b>the</b> development of <b>the</b> Catastrophe Bond <b>Market,</b> more formally known as the Insurance Linked Securities (ILS) <b>Market.</b> <b>The</b> ILS <b>market</b> is small; <b>the</b> longevity <b>market</b> is potentially enormous. <b>The</b> ILS <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been around for some 15 years; <b>the</b> Longevity <b>market</b> less than 5 years. <b>The</b> ILS <b>market</b> <b>has</b> had a heterogeneous approach to loss measures; <b>the</b> longevity <b>market</b> <b>has</b> striven for homogeneity. <b>The</b> ILS <b>market</b> <b>has</b> used security, i. e. bond, structures; <b>the</b> longevity <b>market</b> uses derivative, i. e. swap, structures. Nearly all ILS transactions cover “event” risk; nearly all longevity structures are “aggregate”. The paper reflects on these and other differences and speculates {{on the nature of the}} two approaches. ...|$|R
25|$|Unger’s {{critique}} of Marginalism begins with Walras’ equilibrium theory, which attempted {{to achieve a}} certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> {{been shown to be}} indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.|$|E
25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by the {{decision}} made concerning the Moran Market in 2016, protesters gathered at Gupo Market in Busan in February 2017 calling for {{the closure of the}} dog meat vendors. The Gupo Market is of similar size to the Moran Market and has been around since the Joseon Dynasty. In the recent decades, the number of dog meat vendors in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> decreased to only 22 vendors due to the efforts of the government trying to improve the image of the city for tourists. As of now, there have been no official statements by the local government involving plans to remove the dog meat vendors.|$|E
50|$|Karwan Bazar {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{wholesale}} marketplaces in Dhaka city. It is also one of the largest marketplaces in South Asia.

In 1967, the station was sold to Stanley Marsh 3.|$|R
25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of asset-backed bond called a covered bond, {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. Covered bonds were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began issuing mortgage covered bonds. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between covered bonds and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into covered bonds keep those loans on their books. This means that when a company with mortgage assets on its books issues the covered bond, its balance sheet grows, which would not occur if it issued an MBS, although it may still guarantee the securities payments.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, housing {{inequality}} {{is often}} relative to racial discrimination {{and differences in}} wealth. Banks and other mortgage lenders evaluate people according to where they live and their credit rating. In a capitalist country such as USA companies lend money to home buyers {{for the purpose of}} making a profit from interest on the loan. In China, racial issues are less important because the population is mostly Chinese. Instead the fast changing economy in China has led to investors taking advantage of outdated and incomplete real estate legislation. The ensuing real estate bubble which priced many genuine home buyers out of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been addressed by placing a heavy tax on homes resold within 3 months of purchase.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 the Council on the Environment of New York City {{established}} the Greenmarket program, which provides regional small family farmers opportunities {{to sell their}} fruits, vegetables and other farm products at open-air markets in city public squares. The Greenmarket program manages 45 markets in the five boroughs. More than 100 New York City restaurants source their ingredients from Greenmarket farmers each week; Greenmarket farmers also annually donate about 500,000 pounds of food to City Harvest and other hunger relief organizations each year. The most famous location is the Union Square Greenmarket, held Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. year-round. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> 250,000 customers a week who purchase 1,000 varieties {{of fruits and vegetables}} at the market.|$|E
