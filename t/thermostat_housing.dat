2500|$|With {{a normal}} {{operating}} temperature of [...] prior to the recall switching to a [...] thermostat, the midmounted engine utilized long pipes to carry coolant to the front-mounted radiator. This demanded that a special coolant filling procedure be followed to prevent air pockets, as with many modern cars. Simply pouring coolant into the <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing</b> (on the engine) might leave an air bubble in the radiator, while adding coolant just to the radiator might leave an air bubble in the engine's coolant passages. Proper procedure (with engine idling and the thermostat removed, filling the <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing,</b> popping the bubble out of the radiator by cracking open the radiator cap until coolant exits) must be followed {{in order to ensure}} an air-free cooling system.|$|E

40|$|Although high {{performance}} anion exchange chromatography (HPABC) is used routinely in several research and routine laboratories, results {{can sometimes be}} disappointing. Consistent retention times are necessary when using the peak height mode for quantitation, necessitating {{the use of a}} thermostatted oven. Detector response is also temperature dependent and, even with airconditioning, linearity can be poor. A <b>thermostatted</b> <b>housing</b> for the detector and an efficient airconditioned room have resulted in good detector linearities over restricted concentration ranges. The accurate measurement of low levels of invert in raw and white sugar was compromised by sucrose inversion while the sample vials were queuing for analysis. Addition of a biocide and sodium hydroxide resulted in greatly improved results. Analysis. of sucrose in mixed juice indicated that invertase activity was occurring in the diluted samples (particularly from mills rather than from diffusers) prior to injection. Procedures for denaturing the samples are outlined...|$|R
5000|$|Industrial and {{residential}} loads are increasingly controlled through demand response. For example, {{during periods of}} peak electrical demand in the summer, the utility control centers {{may be able to}} raise the <b>thermostats</b> of <b>houses</b> enrolled in a load reduction program, to temporarily decrease electrical demand from a large number of customers without significantly affecting their comfort. Customers are usually compensated for their participation in such programs.|$|R
5000|$|The new V4 {{engine was}} mounted {{well to the}} front of the car, its centre ahead of the front wheels. It {{incorporated}} a balance shaft in order to try to compensate for some of the imbalance resulting from the unconventional positioning of the four crank pins in relation to the three bearings for the crankshaft. At this stage commentators nevertheless found the V4 unit [...] "rougher" [...] and noisier than comparable in-line units. The water pump and <b>thermostat</b> were <b>housed</b> in a sealed unit permanently protected by anti-freeze. The fan was thermostatically controlled which was still an unusual feature at this time. An eye catching feature introduced under the bonnet/hood in 1964 was color-coding on the rocker cover according to the engine type. [...] engines were coded green, [...] blue and [...] red. (The [...] version was replaced in the same year by the more powerful [...] unit.) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{fuel filter}} {{moved from the}} wing {{to the top of}} the <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing.</b> The oil filler moved from the {{crankcase}} cover to the dipstick housing. The front indicators were originally combined with the headlights, but later replaced by side lights (moved from the headlight reflector) and separate indicators were fitted in the bumper.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{changes were}} made to the engine {{ancillaries}} over the years. Early models had an inline electrical diesel heater, which invariably stopped working after a couple of years, but made no difference, unless used in very cold conditions, so it wasn't fitted on later models, the fuel passing over the <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing</b> to warm it up instead.|$|E
40|$|Datasets are {{important}} for researchers to build models and test how well their machine learning algorithms perform. This paper presents the Rainforest Automation Energy (RAE) dataset to help smart grid researchers test their algorithms which make use of smart meter data. This initial release of RAE contains 1 Hz data (mains and sub-meters) from two a residential house. In addition to power data, environmental and sensor data from the <b>house's</b> <b>thermostat</b> is included. Sub-meter data {{from one of the}} houses includes heat pump and rental suite captures which is of interest to power utilities.

5000|$|The {{input to}} a {{feedback}} controller {{is the same}} as what it is trying to control - the controlled variable is [...] "fed back" [...] into the controller. The <b>thermostat</b> of a <b>house</b> {{is an example of a}} feedback controller. This controller relies on measuring the controlled variable, in this case the temperature of the house, and then adjusting the output, whether or not the heater is on. However, feedback control usually results in intermediate periods where the controlled variable is not at the desired set-point. With the thermostat example, if the door of the house were opened on a cold day, the house would cool down. After it fell below the desired temperature (set-point), the heater would kick on, but there would be a period when the house was colder than desired.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Allergen Mixing Assistant (AMA) by Xtract Solutions is {{a device}} {{designed}} to more “effectively refrigerate, organize, and mix allergenic extracts”. Although Xtract Solutions intended {{the product to}} be fully automated, the company has decided against its automation and declared its current design as a minimum viable product whose components are too expensive, difficult to source and complex. Therefore, Cal Poly AMA design team - Mitchell Parks and Minwoo Suh - has decided to replace these expensive components with much more economical alternatives as shown below: Stirling cooler → Thermoelectric (Peltier) cooler Custom Arduino Controller Card → TEC <b>Thermostat</b> *** Original <b>Housing</b> with Wasted Space * → New Housing ** The cost analysis of the new design quotes the Allergen Mixing Assistant at $ 730, albeit minus the labor cost and manufacturing time, much more economical than the previous design where the Stirling Cooler alone was quoted at $ 830. Beyond its cost-effectiveness, the new Allergen Mixing Assistant has been improved from its previous design in following categories: 1, more effective cooling; and 2, better packaging - its overall physical dimensions have been reduced. Testing proved that a larger focus on heat rejection is needed to maintain the desired set temperature. Due to insufficient heat dissipation our new unit is unable to run for extended periods of time, but will be a viable option if a larger heat sink can be obtained...|$|R
50|$|The 1998 {{redesign}} of the KV6 by Rover Group under BMW included replacing the original metal inlet-manifolds and butterfly valves, with plastic units manufactured in Germany. The redesign also involved replacing the metal <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing</b> {{with a plastic}} unit. A costly but uncommon side-effect to using plastic components are breakages in the VIS (Variable Inlet System) butterfly valves that are mounted inside the non-serviceable inlet manifold. The second common fault is failure of the <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing</b> (often failing along the mould line), {{that will lead to}} gradual but rarely complete loss of coolant. A third common fault is oil contamination in the VIS motors that are mounted {{on the sides of the}} inlet manifold and control air intake. Damage to the butterfly valves or VIS motors is limited to causing a rattling noise in the manifold or minor loss of power at certain engine conditions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{shortcoming}} of the 1955 265 was {{its lack}} of any provision for oil filtration built into the block, instead relying on an add-on filter mounted on the <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing,</b> and that was an [...] "option only". In spite of its novel green sand foundry construction, the '55 block's lack of adequate oil filtration leaves it typically only desirable to period collectors.|$|E
50|$|Common {{issues with}} the TK {{throughout}} the model run were Holden's use of an unusual all-plastic <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing</b> design on the engine, which could fail and split apart due to repeated stress and heat cycles. The ABS system is known for electrical faults and failure of the ABS system to operate if the warning light illuminates. Front tire wear was high in the early 2006 models due to factory suspension camber settings, which were revised by 2008. Automatic transmission TK cars were also {{the subject of a}} recall due to internal shift solenoids not allowing the car to shift higher than 3rd gear.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of technologies affects the demands of industries at the present time. Thus, automatic control has played {{a vital role in}} the advance of engineering and science. In today’s industries, control of DC motors is a common practice. Therefore, implementation of DC motor controller is required. There are many types of controller {{that can be used to}} implement the elegant and effective output. One of them is by using a PI controller. PI stands for Proportional and Integral Controllers which are designed to eliminate the need for continuous operator attention thus provide automatic control to the system. Cruise control in a car and a <b>house</b> <b>thermostat</b> are common examples of how controllers are used to automatically adjust some variable to hold the measurement (or process variable) at the set-point. This project is focusing on implementing PI controller to control speed of a dc motor. The overall project is divided into two parts. The first part is concern on the simulation using MATLAB simulink where the dc motor is modeled and PI controller is tuned using Ziegler-Nichols rules and software tuning. The second part is implementing the simulation. This part is divided into another two parts, Graphical User Interface (GUI) development and hardware interfacing. GUI is built using National Instrument LabVIEW software with implementation of PI controller. An oscilloscope also had been build there. Hardware interfacing part is built with Mitsumi dc mini-motors, M 31 E- 1 Series, speed sensor and analog to digital converter, DAC 8032. As the result, PI controller is capable to control the speed of dc motor followed the result from simulation...|$|R
40|$|FISH PRODUCTION: On October 7 th the 2008 {{spawning}} season was completed. 823 adults {{were transferred to}} the facility for the 2008 season. The overall adult mortality was 6. 9 % (1. 3 % pre-spawning mortality and 5. 6 % encountered after sorting). Wild/natural salmon collected included 278 females, 173 males, and 29 jacks for a total 480 fish for the 2008 brood. Supplemented brood stock collected included 149 adults (85 females, 35 males and 29 jacks). Hatchery control brood collected for research included 194 adults (91 females, 68 males and 35 jacks). Eggs will be inventoried in November with an actual summary of eggs numbers to be submitted for the November report. The estimated egg takes (production) for the 2008 season was 1, 375, 146 eggs with 1, 006, 063 comprising of W x W crosses and 250, 755 eggs of H x H crosses with 118, 328 supplement crosses. Total fish {{on hand for the}} 2007 brood is 768, 751 with an average fish per pound of 30. 6 f/lb. FISH CULTURE: The marking and pit-tagging operation started on October 13 th. The pit-tagging portion was completed on October 23 rd. A total 40, 000 juveniles were pit-tagged (2, 000 from each of the production ponds and 4, 000 each for the hatchery juvenile ponds 9 & 10). Cle Elum staff began shocking, sorting, counting and splitting eggs in incubation. Shocking eggs will separate live eggs from dead eggs. Eggs are treated with formalin three times a week to control fungus. The focus for the culturists during the month of October entail completing the final spawn (egg take) on the 7 th, pond cleaning, keeping the marking trailers supplied with fish and end of month sampling. The adult holding ponds were power washed and winterized for the shut down period. Facility crew members Greg Strom and Mike Whitefoot assisted Joe Blodgett and his crew with fish brood collection on the 22 nd of October. Fall Chinook and Coho salmon were seined up and put in tanker trucks from Chandler canal and transported to holding ponds for later spawning. Charlie, Simon and Vernon assisted with sorting and spawning Summer Chinook at the Wells hatchery for the Summer Chinook reintroduction program on the lower Yakima River. WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 12, 909 gallons/min. Four river pumps (12, 400 gpm) and one well pump No. 2 (509 gpm) are supplying water to the facility main head box and the egg incubation building. ACCLIMATION SITES: Easton had much activity in October, the electrical power panel that's switches commercial power operation to generator power (transfer switch) malfunctioned. Charlie called Wallace Electric as well as ASCO Services to trouble shoot the problem which has yet to be determined. Heaters have been turned on in all service buildings at the acclimation sites. Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission traveled to Easton to install a pole to mount a satellite and a new ups backup system with new monitors and computers for pit tag data recording and transmitting. Brown and Jackson pumped out the septic tanks at Easton and Clark Flat. AMB Tools performed maintenance on the compressors at the acclimation sites as well as Cle Elum (5 total).

5000|$|In 1966, General Motors {{designed}} a special [...] engine {{for the production}} Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to [...] from 1967 to 1969. It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the <b>thermostat</b> <b>housing</b> from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuningneeded. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had [...] primaries x 3.00 in secondaries. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|E
