500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E

It was recorded in New York City in 1997 at three recording studios: The Place, Duotone Studios, and Compositions. A pop song, it features [...] "rippling atmospherics" [...] and a [...] "punk-ish guitar", with a user from Sputnikmusic commenting {{that it may have}} been influenced by the American band Pixies. Its production consists of a [...] "briskly strummed" [...] acoustic guitar and a triplet-playing keyboard.

500|$|... "The Son Also Draws" [...] {{was written}} by Ricky Blitt, his first episode in the Family Guy series, and {{directed}} by former Simpsons director Neil Affleck, also in his first Family Guy episode.

Andrew Gormley and voice actor Mike Henry acted as staff writers for this episode, while Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman and Chris Sheridan worked as the story editors. The subplot of [...] "The Son Also Draws" [...] that involved Lois losing the car was based on the 1985 comedy film Lost in America. The part where Peter pretends to be an Indian to get <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> back was inspired by real-life instances of people who were [...] "1/64th" [...] Native American receiving money from wealthy casino tribes.|$|E
500|$|The {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor brought the U.S. into the war. Vonnegut {{was a member}} of Reserve Officers' Training Corps, but poor grades and a satirical article in Cornell's {{newspaper}} cost him his place there. He was placed on academic probation in May 1942 and dropped out the following January. No longer eligible for a student deferment, he faced likely conscription into United States Army. Instead of waiting to be drafted, he enlisted in the army and in March 1943 reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for basic training. Vonnegut was trained to fire and maintain howitzers, a type of artillery, and later received instruction in mechanical engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee as part of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP). In early 1944, the ASTP was canceled due to the Army's need for soldiers to support the D-Day invasion, and Vonnegut was ordered to an infantry battalion at Camp Atterbury, south of Indianapolis in Edinburgh, Indiana, where he trained as a scout. He lived so close to his home that he was [...] "able to sleep in [...] own bedroom and use <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>car</b> on weekends". On May 14, 1944, Vonnegut returned home on leave for Mother's Day weekend to discover that his mother had committed suicide the previous night by overdosing on sleeping pills.|$|E
