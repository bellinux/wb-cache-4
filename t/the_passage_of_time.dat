More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hardly any {{empirical}} work exists {{concerning the}} relationship between the intra-individually stable time perspective relating to the past, present, and future and the subjective speed <b>of</b> <b>time</b> passing in everyday life. Moreover, studies consistently show that <b>the</b> subjective <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> over <b>the</b> period of the last ten years speeds up as we get older. Modulating variables influencing this phenomenon are still unknown. To investigate these two unresolved issues, we conducted an online survey with n = 423 participants ranging in age between 17 and 81 assessing trait <b>time</b> perspective <b>of</b> the past, present, and future, and relating these subscales with a battery of measures pertaining to <b>the</b> subjective <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> subjective <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as an age-dependent variable was probed in relationship to emotion awareness, appraisal and regulation. Results show how present hedonism is linked with having fewer routines in life and a faster <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last week; the past negative perspective is related to time pressure, time expansion and more routine; a pronounced future perspective is related to a general faster <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Importantly, increased emotion regulation and a balanced time perspective are related to a slower <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last ten years. These novel findings are discussed within models <b>of</b> <b>time</b> perception and the time perspective...|$|R

The newly arisen lush green fields attracted grass eating animals, mainly deer and elephants, who slowly migrated towards these areas and even preferred to stay there throughout the monsoon.|$|E
