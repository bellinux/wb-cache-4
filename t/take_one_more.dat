2500|$|The Miracle at the Meadowlands is {{the term}} used by sportscasters and Philadelphia Eagles fans for a fumble {{recovery}} by cornerback Herman Edwards that he returned for a touchdown {{at the end of}} a November 19, 1978, NFL game against the New York Giants in Giants Stadium. It is considered miraculous because the Giants were ahead and could easily have run out the final seconds; they had the ball and the Eagles had no timeouts left. Everyone watching expected quarterback Joe Pisarcik to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> snap and kneel with the ball, thus running out the clock and preserving a 17–12 Giants upset. Instead, he botched an attempt to hand off the football to fullback Larry Csonka. Edwards [...] picked up the dropped ball and ran 26 yards for the winning score.|$|E
2500|$|On the field, the Expos won {{just four}} games {{more than they}} lost between 1986 and 1991 as the {{organization}} set about rebuilding its development system and acquiring {{a new generation of}} players. The team struggled to attract free agents to Montreal, and Bronfman had grown disillusioned with both the business of baseball and the challenge of drawing fans to Olympic Stadium for a middling ball club. He hoped to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> chance at winning a title, however, and in , the Expos made a push for a division title by acquiring start pitcher and pending free agent Mark Langston from the Seattle Mariners. [...] The price would ultimately prove to be a high one as the Expos gave up future Hall of Famer Randy Johnson and two other pitchers. The trade helped propel the Expos to first place in the NL East by the All-Star break. They held the top spot into August before Langston and the team collapsed. [...] The Expos finished fourth in the division with an 81–81 record, and Langston left Montreal as a free agent.|$|E

I slept at the Stein inn, and started {{in the morning to}} do that {{agreeable}} first mountain of all, the Titlis, whose shining genial head attracted me. I did not think a guide necessary, but a boy took me up by a track near Gadmen, and left me to my Siegfried map some way up the great ridge of rocks that overlooks the Engstlen Alp. I a little overestimated my mountaineering, and it came about that I was benighted while I was still high above the Joch Pass on my descent. Some of this was steep and needed caution. I had to come down slowly with my folding lantern, in which a reluctant candle went out at regular intervals, and I did not reach the little inn at Engstlen Alp until long after eleven at night. By that time I was very tired and hungry.|$|E

Lord Fawn had taken long {{in the writing of}} his letter, and she was justified in taking what time she pleased in answering it;--but, for her own sake, it had better be answered quickly. She had tried her hand at two different replies, and did not at all doubt but what she would send the affirmative answer, if she were sure that these latter discoveries would not alter Lord Fawn's decision. Lord Fawn had distinctly told her that, if she pleased, he would marry her. She would please;--having been much troubled by the circumstances of the past six months. But then, was it not almost a certainty that Lord Fawn would retreat from his offer on learning the facts which were now so well known as to have been related in the public papers? She thought that she would <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> night to think of it.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the last}} {{battlefield}} on which Molly Pitcher appeared, but {{it had not been}} her first.

After a vigorous defense, the Americans found {{that it was impossible to}} defend the fort, and a retreat was ordered. As the soldiers were rushing out of the rear of the fort, Molly's husband turned away from his gun, threw down his match,--a piece of rope soaked in combustible substances, and slowly burning at one end, which was used in those days for discharging cannon,--and ran for his life. Molly prepared to follow him; but as she saw the glowing match on the ground, and knew that her husband's gun was loaded, she could not resist the desire to <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> crack at the enemy. So she stopped for an instant, picked up the match, touched off the gun, and dashed away after her husband. The cannon which then blazed out in the face of the advancing British {{was the last}} gun which the Americans fired in Fort Clinton.|$|E
