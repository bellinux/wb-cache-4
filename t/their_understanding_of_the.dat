5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and ecologist Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped {{to mobilize the}} environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge <b>their</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within <b>their</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and <b>their</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an exploratory study of an aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technological knowledge <b>of</b> {{two groups of}} five-year-old students {{in their first year}} at school. <b>Their</b> emerging <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steps required to develop a new product were investigated through a series of interviews. A theoretical framework linking technological knowledge to ‘funds of knowledge’ from experiences outside the classroom supported the analysis. The data suggest that young children draw on a broad range of experiences and knowledge, often uncritically, in order to explain how things are made. They are able to transfer <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technological process from one experience to another particularly when they have the language and background experiences to support them. Of particular note however, is that they were often unfamiliar with <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> materials and therefore unable to anticipate the processes necessary to convert raw materials into a final product. The research also highlighted some key considerations for working with young children in this area...|$|R

Barruel presents a thorough application of conspiracy theory methodology. As a result, he has had a lasting influence on following generations.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{operating room}} nurse is hidden from most nurses and patients behind <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theatre suite. This 'hidden' world, shrouds operating room nursing practice {{in an air}} of mystery.

Using an ethnographic methodology, six operating room nurses share their stories which depict <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nurse's role in the operating room and communicate their experiences <b>of</b> practice. Within <b>the</b> data chapters the nurses tell stories of coming to theatre and <b>their</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operating room nurse.
