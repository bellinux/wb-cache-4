5|$|The cult members, squeamish about {{committing}} acts of violence, {{decide that}} Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, they let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. The assassin chases {{her through the}} darkened streets with a switchblade, but she eludes him and returns to her apartment above Dante's. She briefly encounters her neighbor, Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), {{a young woman with}} a terminal illness. Mimi confesses to Jacqueline that she's afraid to die, and plans to have one last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself. The <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> the chair falling over is heard, but the sick woman does not recognize the sound as she leaves for the evening.|$|E
25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or {{the quality of a}} voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E
500|$|... "Scheiße" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} techno, electroclash, Eurodisco, and Eurodance {{from the middle}} of 1990s influences. Andrew Unterberger of PopDust noted that the song was {{influenced}} by Madonna's music, notably [...] "Justify My Love," [...] which, like [...] "Scheiße," [...] has sections in which the artist speaks rather than sings. [...] "Scheiße" [...] has been described as [...] "a strange mash up of digestible, American shopping mecca music and the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> German nightclub electronica." [...] The song features a [...] "grimy" [...] bass and so many [...] "fizzing" [...] synths that it produces a [...] "keyboard assault on the senses." [...] The song's lyrics are of female empowerment. Although the theme of [...] "Scheiße" [...] is similar to the inspirational theme of other songs on Born This Way, The Village Voice questioned the sincerity of the feminist lyrics, after Gaga had once said, [...] "I’m not a feminist. I hail men, I love men," [...] but calls herself on the song a [...] "blond high-heeled feminist enlisting femmes for this." [...] " [...] someone who we’re watching evolve or someone who, at any given point, doesn’t really know what she’s talking about?" [...] the article wrote of Gaga. The German word [...] "scheiße", the title of the song and a word frequently used in the song, translates into [...] "shit" [...] into English. Gaga repeatedly speaks in German sounding gibberish during the song, although in a French accent.|$|E
60|$|Low, muttered curses, then {{mingled with}} dull <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> hoofs and strain of leather and heaves of tired horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{added another}} voice, which broke harshly through the <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> hoofs, [...] "ten teams wouldn't move {{the man who}} rode away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} my speculations ended. I {{think they were}} not so much ended as distracted by the distant <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> the guns that were opening fire at long range upon Namur.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick had {{directed}} the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who {{attempts to make}} his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndons lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told [...] that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted [...] himself in his office to read them all: [...] "Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tim Grierson at About.com {{stated that}} Living Things is [...] "a {{straightforward}} collection that plays to their rap-rock strengths, and while it’s often musically engaging, these 12 songs don’t have enough cumulative impact. As a result, the record {{ends up being}} a diverting experience rather than an arresting one." [...] At The A.V. Club, Evan Rytlewski commented that the band [...] "can dial down (or turn back up) the heaviness all it wants, recruit the most Grammy-proven producers, and keep current with the latest electronic textures, but those moves can only take Linkin Park so far when its songs have all the emotional range of an MMA bout". Another mixed review from Hamish MacBain at NME stated that [...] "...their foray into said genre here is restricted to the three minutes of ‘Castle of Glass’. The rest is… well, to be fair, they’ve obviously been listening to a bit of Skrillex, and thus the heavy guitar <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> yore {{has been replaced by}} a new, heavy electronic thud, but that aside it’s largely the usual semi-hilarious histrionica to which we’ve become accustomed." [...] MacBain also added that, in the sub-description of the review, the album is [...] "A predictable earache".|$|E
2500|$|Within three minutes, the Greene Street {{stairway}} became unusable in both directions. Terrified employees crowded {{onto the}} single exterior fire escape, which city officials had allowed Asch to erect {{instead of the}} required third staircase. It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure {{which may have been}} broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly [...] to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that [...] "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture -- the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk". Even once firefighters arrived, their ladders were only long enough to reach as high as the sixth to seventh floors.|$|E
60|$|It {{was broken}} by a horrid, long-drawn scream of a horse and the <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> heavy hoofs. Venters sprang erect and wheeled south. Along the canyon rim, near the edge, came Wrangle, once more in thundering flight.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> paddles, and the canoes melted into the {{darkness}} as the moon sailed behind a cloud again; but the whirr and thump of engines drew nearer, and Jefferson reached down for the lantern.|$|R
60|$|The French {{fire was}} brisk, the <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> the balls, as they struck the tower, {{occurring}} {{five or six}} times a minute. The three officers entered the tower. Two or three holes appeared in the wall of the floor by which they entered it.|$|R
60|$|A shout of {{laughter}} and the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> a heavy blow followed the appeal.|$|E
60|$|Macdonald {{held his}} hand up, and a rapid <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> hoofs came faintly through the silence.|$|E
60|$|They did so, and {{now they}} also heard the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> horse's hoofs and the shouts of men.|$|E
5000|$|Rob Wacey of Allmusic stated [...] "While {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} familiar scores, Kurzel also brings a fresh layer to the palette, {{with the occasional}} <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> electro-bass and subdued kick drums that ring out through continuous reverb, swallowing up the mix as foreboding strings cut in and out." ...|$|R
60|$|Jim Williams {{sent out}} a sharp call. From the canyon-slope came {{answering}} shouts. There were sounds of heavy bodies breaking through brush, followed by the <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> feet. Then men could be plainly heard running up the trail. Jim leaned against the door-post, and the three fellows before him stood rigid as stone.|$|R
60|$|Blicky darted {{through the}} door and his {{footsteps}} <b>thudded</b> out <b>of</b> hearing.|$|R
60|$|When {{they came}} out into the {{clearing}} they heard the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> hoofs, and saw a mounted man send a horse at the tall split fence. The slip-rails were up, and the fence was unusually well put together, {{but there was a}} crash as the top bar flew apart, and presently the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> hoofs grew fainter down the fir-shadowed trail. Miss Deringham now appeared quite serene again.|$|E
60|$|Into {{the stillness}} came the {{repeated}} heavy <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> guns, one, two, a pause, then three in quick succession.|$|E
60|$|Outside the {{monotonous}} walk of the sentry {{sounded like}} the perpetual <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> a hammer beating upon her bruised temples.|$|E
6000|$|Together they pricked their mares, whirled them about, and fled, while {{from behind}} {{they heard the}} {{soothing}} [...] "Whoas" [...] of the rider, the <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> the heavy hoofs on the roadway, and a wild imperative neigh. The Outlaw answered, and the Fawn was but a moment behind her. From the commotion they knew Mountain Lad was getting tempestuous.|$|R
6000|$|The coarse laugh gave {{place to}} moving footsteps. The {{rattling}} clink of stirrup and spur {{mingled with the}} restless stamp of horse. Chance had mounted. Dene's voice drawled out: [...] "Good-bye, Naab, I shore will see you all some day." [...] The heavy <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> many hoofs evened into a roar that diminished as it rushed away.|$|R
60|$|As he rode {{around a}} corner of the stone house his horse snorted and stopped. A lean, shaggy pony jumped at sight of him, almost {{displacing}} a red long-haired blanket that covered an Indian saddle. Quick <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> hoofs in sand drew Shefford's attention to a corral made of peeled poles, and here he saw another pony.|$|R
60|$|It rose beautifully, like a rocket, {{and fell}} {{inside of the}} ramparts, making only a little <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> a sound.|$|E
60|$|Again a {{whistling}} {{sound came}} with the bellow of an overcharged rifle; again the sickening <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> a bullet striking flesh.|$|E
60|$|Then {{once more}} {{they were at}} a standstill. Helen heard the <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> boots {{striking}} the ground, and the snorts of horses.|$|E
60|$|Alton said nothing, but sat {{smoking and}} staring at the fire, until Seaforth rolled himself in his damp {{blankets}} and sank into not altogether refreshing sleep. A misty light was creeping into the tent when he was awakened by the <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> his companion's axe, and rising stiffly with the ache at the hip-joint which every bushman knows, went out shivering.|$|R
60|$|Nas Ta Bega {{turned the}} mustangs loose among those Shefford had noticed, and {{presently}} there rose a snorting, whistling, kicking, plunging melee. A {{cloud of dust}} hid them, and then a <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> swift hoofs told of a run through the cedars. Joe Lake began picking over stacks of goat-skins and bags of wool that were piled against the hogan.|$|R
60|$|Just at {{that instant}} Duane felt an almost inappreciable {{movement}} of the adobe wall which supported him. He could scarcely credit his senses. But the rattle inside Longstreth's room was mingling with little dull <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> falling dirt. The adobe wall, merely dried mud, was crumbling. Duane distinctly felt a tremor pass through it. Then the blood gushed back to his heart.|$|R
60|$|And I {{was left}} alone with the steady thud, <b>thud,</b> <b>of</b> the screw and the gentle {{creaking}} of the boats at the davits.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{more was}} said by either, {{and in another}} minute or two there was a <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> hoofs as the outlaws rode away.|$|E
60|$|Wheeler was {{sensible}} of {{a certain}} uneasiness as {{he listened to the}} crunch of the boring tool and the jarring <b>thud</b> <b>of</b> the hammers.|$|E
5000|$|Psychic Wars was {{released}} in 2003, with reviewer Mason Jones commenting [...] "Spectre's world is a dark, dank back alley, with echoes of doom-laden bass pulses and the distant clanks and <b>thuds</b> <b>of</b> a factory {{on the outskirts of}} town". German magazine Skug described the album as [...] "Gnackwat for the brain cells". The album featured vocals from Honeychild and was mixed by Pere Ubu's Tony Maimone.|$|R
60|$|The {{answer and}} the child's further talk {{were lost in}} the {{distance}} of the kitchen. The small, anxious question, and the quick <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> Gwen's feet, made Siegmund lie still with torture. He wanted to hear no more. He lay shrinking within himself. It seemed that his soul was sensitive to madness. He felt that he could not, come what might, get up and meet them all.|$|R
60|$|The {{land had}} been looming darker, and the <b>thudding</b> <b>of</b> waves upon the sand sounded louder every instant upon my ears. I could already see the quick dancing gleam {{of the surf}} in front of me. Suddenly, as I peered through the {{deepening}} shadow, a long dark boat shot out from it, like a trout from under a stone, making straight in our direction.|$|R
