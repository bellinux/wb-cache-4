5|$|Although the {{majority}} of his works were in Polish, he <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many of his works were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E

The film was lost while Chatwin was trying to sell it to European television companies.|$|E

5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, {{not so much for}} buying things, but to interact with the people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E
5|$|Off the court, Durant often {{ranks as}} one of the highest-earning {{basketball}} players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for his philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at acting, appearing in the film Thunderstruck.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's San Francisco branch {{closed in}} May 1857, and he {{relocated}} to New York {{on behalf of}} the same bank. When the bank failed during the financial Panic of 1857, he closed the New York branch. In early 1858, he returned to California to wrap-up the bank's affairs there. Later in 1858, he moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, where he <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at law practice and other ventures without much success.|$|E

His father remained in Guatemala and died there in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Bell {{was then}} an {{employee}} of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one point, he <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield {{to take a}} seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to {{his work as a}} barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 {{he was one of the}} highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952.|$|E

5|$|He practiced at the Bhiwani Boxing Club, where former national-level boxer and Jagdish Singh {{recognised}} his talent. Working part-time, he even <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at modelling to financially {{support his}} coaching. The first recognition for Vijender {{came when he}} won a bout in the state level competition. Vijender won a silver medal in his first sub-junior nationals in 1997 {{and went on to}} bag his first gold medal at the 2000 Nationals. In 2003, he became the all-India youth boxing champion. The turning point, however, came in the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. Despite being a junior boxer, Vijender took part in the selection trials and was picked for the meet where he fought valiantly to win a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{he again}} <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of}} the New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E

He has also <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at acting, {{appearing}} in a cameo {{role on the}} HBO series Entourage. In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck, receiving positive reviews for his performance. That same year, James' digital video company, Uninterrupted, raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.|$|E

5|$|Ramanujan {{spent nearly}} five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and {{published}} part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of mathematics had come into question {{and the need for}} mathematically rigorous proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration - a conflict that neither found easy.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his work}} as a barrister, Hastings also <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at writing plays. His first play was The Moscow Doctor, based on a novel by Seton Merriman which he had rewritten; it ran for over a week in Brighton. He desired to have an {{original}} work performed, however, and to this end wrote The River over a period of 20 years before taking it to St James's Theatre, where it was accepted and performed in June 1925. The play starred Owen Nares and initially went well, but foundered in the second act due to the plot requiring the most popular actors to be taken off stage - the character played by Nares, for example, broke his leg. Reviews compared the plot to something out of the Boy's Own Paper. The play lasted only a month before being cancelled, but Hastings was able to sell the film rights for £2,000, and it was turned into a Hollywood film called The Notorious Lady starring Lewis Stone and Barbara Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered {{by some of}} his successes, in 1940 Narayan <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at a journal, Indian Thought. With {{the help}} of his uncle, a car salesman, Narayan managed to get more than a {{thousand}} subscribers in Madras city alone. However, the venture did not last long due to Narayan's inability to manage it, and it ceased publication within a year. His first collection of short stories, Malgudi Days, was published in November 1942, followed by The English Teacher in 1945. In between, being cut off from England due to the war, Narayan started his own publishing company, naming it (again) Indian Thought Publications; the publishing company was a success and is still active, now managed by his granddaughter. Soon, with a devoted readership stretching from New York to Moscow, Narayan's books started selling well and in 1948 he started building his own house on the outskirts of Mysore; the house was completed in 1953. Around this period, Narayan wrote the screenplay for the Gemini Studios film Miss Malini (1947), which remained the only screenplay by him that was successfully adapted into a feature film.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in {{a one-day}} match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis had thrown {{the game by}} batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> best, pointing {{out that he was}} named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had thrown the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Sylvester's boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, {{became aware}} that he had become {{infected}} with HIV; with no known medical cure, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died in September 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he {{moved into a new}} apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became too sick to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E
5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later <b>tried</b> <b>his</b> hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush.|$|E
