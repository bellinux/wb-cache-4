25|$|Kitty: In {{games with}} players where the cards cannot be dealt evenly, {{there is a}} {{variation}} in which no cards are removed from the deck, but instead a kitty composed of the leftover cards (or one trick's worth of cards plus <b>the</b> <b>leftovers)</b> is placed at center. Whoever is dealt the 2, or alternatively, the player with the highest bid (tie-breaker being first to make that bid), picks up the kitty before bidding begins, integrates it into their hand and then discards {{the same number of}} cards. If a round of cards in addition to <b>the</b> <b>leftovers</b> is placed in the kitty, the discard by the player who picked up the kitty counts as a trick. This introduces more uncertainty in bids because usually the person with the kitty tries to void one suit and trump earlier in the game.|$|E

25|$|Sesame seeds {{were used}} in the {{preparation}} of oil, or were eaten dry, or were added to dishes such as stews as a flavoring; <b>the</b> <b>leftovers</b> after pressing out the oil were eaten in a cake form. The Hebrew for sesame, shumshum, is related to the Akkadian samassammu, meaning “oil plant”, as the seeds contain about 50% oil, which was pressed from the seeds. Sesame is not mentioned in the Bible, but the Mishna lists sesame oil as suitable for lighting the Sabbath lights, and the oil was also used for frying.|$|E
25|$|However, another {{experiment}} {{showed that}} booby chicks {{do not operate}} exclusively by <b>the</b> <b>Leftovers</b> Hypothesis, where younger chicks are fed only after the elder ones are completely satiated. Instead, researchers identified {{a certain degree of}} tolerance towards the younger sibling during short-term periods of food shortages. This Tolerance Hypothesis suggests that the elder chicks will reduce food intake moderately, just enough so that the younger sibling does not starve. Although this system works during short-term food shortages, it is unsustainable during prolonged periods of dearth. In this latter case, the elder sibling will usually become aggressive and siblicidal.|$|E

25|$|Black bears also rely on salmon as food. <b>The</b> <b>leftovers</b> {{the bears}} leave behind are {{considered}} important nutrients for the Canadian forest, {{such as the}} soil, trees, and plants. In this sense, the salmon feed the forest and in return receive clean water and gravel in which to hatch and grow, sheltered from extremes of temperature and water flow in times {{of high and low}} rainfall. However, the condition of the salmon in Haida has been affected in recent decades. Due to logging and development, much of the salmon's habitat (i.e., Ain River) has been destroyed, resulting in the fish being close to endangered. For residents, this has resulted in limits on catches, in turn, has affected families diets, and cultural events such as feasts. Some of the salmon systems in danger include: the Davidon, Naden, Mamim, and Mathers. It is clear that further protection is needed for salmon, such as their habitats, where logging commonly occurs.|$|E
25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and <b>the</b> <b>leftovers</b> would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its face lit up and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E

500|$|On 7 May Aurora, {{anchored}} at the party's Cape Evans headquarters, was wrenched {{from her}} moorings during a gale and carried with [...] drifting ice [...] far out to sea. Unabled {{to return to}} McMurdo Sound, she remained captive in the ice for nine months until on 12 February 1916, having travelled a distance of around , she reached open water and limped to New Zealand. She carried with her {{the greater part of}} the shore party’s fuel, food rations, clothing and equipment, although the sledging rations for the depots had been landed ashore. [...] To continue with its mission the stranded shore party had to re-supply and re-equip itself from <b>the</b> <b>leftovers</b> from earlier expeditions, notably Captain Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition which had been based at Cape Evans a few years earlier. They were thus able to begin the second season’s depot-laying on schedule, in September 1915.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Leftover</b> Hash Lemma {{states that}} the output of a two-universal hash {{function}} applied to an input with sufficiently high entropy is almost uniformly random.

Here, we prove a (strictly) more general version of <b>the</b> <b>Leftover</b> Hash Lemma that is valid even if side information {{is represented by the}} state of a quantum system. Furthermore, our result applies to arbitrary delta-almost two-universal families of hash functions. <b>The</b> generalized <b>Leftover</b> Hash Lemma has applications in cryptography, e. g., for key agreement in the presence of an adversary who is not restricted to classical information processing...|$|R
