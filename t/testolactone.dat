50|$|<b>Testolactone</b> is a {{synthetic}} 18-oxasteroid and a D-homo-18-oxo analogue of androstenedione (androst-4-en-3,17-dione), with a six-membered lactone ring {{in place of}} the five-membered carbocyclic D-ring.|$|E
5000|$|Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as aminoglutethimide, anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole, and <b>testolactone</b> {{inhibit the}} {{production}} of estrogens from androgens and are used mainly {{in the treatment of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Testolactone</b> and {{formestane}} are 1st and 2nd generation aromatase inhibitors. Formestane was {{the first}} selective aromatase inhibitor that was used for breast cancer treatment {{but it is not}} in clinical use today.|$|E
50|$|<b>Testolactone</b> (INN, USAN) (brand name Teslac) is a non-selective, irreversible, steroidal {{aromatase}} inhibitor {{used as an}} antineoplastic drug {{to treat}} advanced-stage breast cancer. The drug was discontinued in 2008 {{and is no longer}} available for medical use.|$|E
5000|$|Changing the D-ring cyclopentanone to a {{six-membered}} δ-lactone {{decreased the}} binding {{ability of the}} compounds.

5000|$|Schedule G: Most {{of these}} drugs are {{hormonal}} preparations. The drug label must display the text [...] "Caution: It is dangerous to take this preparation except under medical supervision" [...] prominently. Examples of substances under this schedule: <b>Testolactone,</b> Hydroxyurea, Carbutamide, Primidone etc.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its activity as an aromatase inhibitor, <b>testolactone</b> also reportedly possesses some anabolic activity and weak androgenic activity via binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. However, androgenic side effects such as hirsutism, acne, and voice changes {{have been reported in}} no women in clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|Estrogen, at some concentration, {{has been}} found to be {{essential}} for male fertility/spermatogenesis. However, estrogen levels that are too high can impair male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby diminishing intratesticular androgen levels. As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen) and aromatase inhibitors such as <b>testolactone</b> or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis.|$|E
50|$|The spinal {{length in}} boys may be short {{due to a}} rapid advance in {{epiphyseal}} maturation. It is an autosomal dominant condition with a mutation of the luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor. Treatment is with drugs that suppress gonadal steroidogenesis, such as cyproterone acetate, ketoconazole, spironolactone, and <b>testolactone.</b> Alternatively, {{the combination of the}} androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole may be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{action of}} <b>testolactone</b> {{is reported to}} be inhibition of aromatase activity and the reduction in estrogen synthesis that follows. Androstenedione, a 19-carbon steroid hormone produced in the adrenal glands and the gonads, is where estrone synthesis originates and is the source of estrogen in postmenopausal women. In vitro studies report that the aromatase inhibition may be noncompetitive and irreversible, and could possibly account for the persistence of this drug's effect on estrogen synthesis after drug withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|During puberty, {{estrogen}} causes breast maturation {{and growth}} of the uterine lining in girls, and accelerates linear growth and bone maturation in both boys and girls. Decreasing the biosynthesis of estrogen can attenuate these processes. In 12 girls with the McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), in which precocious puberty is due to production of estrogen from ovarian cysts, <b>testolactone</b> (40 mg/kg per day) decreased the volume of ovarian cysts, the frequency of menses, and the rates of growth and bone maturation, for periods of 1 - 4 years. In a 6 -month pilot study of 12 children (eight boys; four girls) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, <b>testolactone,</b> in combination with an antiandrogen (flutamide), a mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone acetate, Florinef), and a reduced glucocorticoid dose, improved the control of growth and bone maturation compared with conventional therapy. In a 6 -year study of 10 boys with familial male precocious puberty, <b>testolactone,</b> in combination with an antiandrogen (spironolactone), decreased rates of growth and bone maturation, and increased predicted adult height. All patients who developed evidence for gonadotropin-dependent puberty were also treated with a GnRH analog. <b>Testolactone</b> had no important adverse effects in any group of patients, although {{the need for a}} four-times-daily dosing schedule made compliance difficult for many families. We conclude that suppressing of estrogen with <b>testolactone</b> was effective therapy, and that more potent Endocrine-Related Cancer (1999) 6 303 - 306 and specific inhibitors of aromatase could further improve the treatment of these disorders...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of {{aromatase}} is {{an efficient}} approach {{for the prevention}} and treatment of breast cancer. New A,D-ring modified steroid analogues of formestane and <b>testolactone</b> were designed and synthesized and their biochemical activity was investigated in vitro {{in an attempt to}} find new aromatase inhibitors and to gain insight into their structure−activity relationships (SAR). All compounds tested were less active than formestane. However, the 3 -deoxy steroidal olefin 3 a and its epoxide derivative 4 a proved to be strong competitive aromatase inhibitors (Ki = 50 and 38 nM and IC 50 = 225 and 145 nM, respectively). According to our findings, the C- 3 carbonyl group is not essential for anti-aromatase activity, but 5 α-stereochemistry and some planarity in the steroidal framework is required. Furthermore, modification of the steroidal cyclopentanone D-ring, by construction of a δ-lactone six-membered ring, decreases the inhibitory potency. From the results obtained, it may be concluded that the binding pocket of the active site of aromatase requires planarity in the region of the steroid A,B-rings and the D-ring structure is critical for the binding.

40|$|A fast {{screening}} {{protocol was}} developed for the simultaneous determination of nine anti-estrogenic agents (aminoglutethimide, anastrozole, clomiphene, drostanolone, formestane, letrozole, mesterolone, tamoxifen, <b>testolactone)</b> plus five of their metabolites in human urine. After an enzymatic hydrolysis, these compounds can be extracted simultaneously from urine with a simple liquidâliquid extraction at alkaline conditions. The analytes were subsequently analyzed by fast-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (fast-GC/MS) after derivatization. The use of a short column, high-flow carrier gas velocity and fast temperature ramping produced an efficient separation of all analytes in about 4 Â min, allowing a processing rate of 10 Â samples/h. The present analytical method was validated according to UNI EN ISO/IEC 17025 guidelines for qualitative methods. The range of investigated parameters included the limit of detection, selectivity, linearity, repeatability, robustness and extraction efficiency. High MS-sampling rate, using a benchtop quadrupole mass analyzer, resulted in accurate peak shape definition under both scan and selected ion monitoring modes, and high sensitivity in the latter mode. Therefore, the performances of the method are comparable to the ones obtainable from traditional GC/MS analysis. The method was successfully tested on real samples arising from clinical treatments of hospitalized patients and could profitably be used for clinical studies on anti-estrogenic drug administration.

40|$|Premenopausal {{women have}} a lower risk of {{coronary}} artery disease than men or postmenopausal women; estrogens are thought to contribute to this lower risk. Administration of exogenous estrogen to post-menopausal women increases plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and may reduce mortality from coronary disease in users. Although many investigations have examined the roles of estrogen in the regulation of lipoproteins in women, {{little attention has been}} directed to estrogen regulation of lipids in men. We designed a paradigm to study the role of physiological levels of estradiol (E 2) on plasma lipoproteins in healthy men. We used a GnRH antagonist, Nal-Glu, to suppress endogenous steroid hormones in healthy men. We then administered testosterone (T) enanthate (100 mg, im, weekly) to restore T levels to the baseline range, and we administered an aromatase inhibitor, <b>testolactone</b> (Teslac), to prevent the normal conversion of T to E 2, thereby producing a selective estrogen deficiency state in normal young men. As controls, we administered Nal-Glu and T along with placebo Teslac to a separate group of men; a third group of men received all placebo medications. We found that in men who received Nal-Glu plus T plus Teslac, E 2 levels were profoundly suppressed during treatment, whereas T levels remained in the baseline range. Plasma HDL cholesterol, particularly, the HDL 2 fraction, decreased significantly in response to the low serum E 2 level. Plasma apoprotein-AI levels also decreased significantly. Plasma LDL and triglyceride levels did not change. All hormone and lipoprotein parameters returned to baseline within 4 weeks after treatment ended. In men who received Nal-Glu plus T, plasma HDL and apoprotein-AI decreased, but these decreases did not achieve statistical significance. Only a small decrease in HDL 2 cholesterol was seen in these men. There were no hormonal or lipid changes in the placebo group. We conclude that in men, physiological levels of E 2 are important in maintaining plasma levels of HDL cholesterol, especially the HDL 2 fraction. These observations suggest that estrogen, in the amount normally produced in men, may offer some degree of protection against cardiovascular disease in males, as they do in women. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern about the}} {{biologic}} effects stemming from steroids in impacted waterways. In aquatic systems, interaction between steroids and sediment influence both contaminant fate as well as subsequent bioavailability to aquatic organisms. The focus of this dissertation research was {{to gain a better}} understanding of steroid behavior in aquatic systems based on the physiochemical properties of sediment and to use this knowledge to better understand the biological effects stemming from sediment-associated progesterone exposure. Two natural aquatic sediments, a sand and a silty loam, were selected to represent marked differences in sediments properties. Initially, sorption of 17 β-estradiol, estrone, progesterone, and testosterone was evaluated to different size fractions of each sediment to determine the steroid sorption capacity and distribution within the whole sediment. Sorption capacity was influenced more by organic carbon content than particle size; while, interactions between size fractions were found to affect the distribution of steroids within the whole sediments. ^ In a subsequent study, the sediments were used to evaluate the fate of progesterone and the corresponding alteration of gene expression in a target organism, the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), using three steroid-responsive genes; vitellogenin, androgen receptor and estrogen receptor-alpha. When exposed to progesterone spiked sand, fish exhibited significant reductions in the expression of vitellogenin in the 5 and 50 ng/g treatment groups at 7 d and significant reductions in vitellogenin and androgen receptor expression after 14 d in the 50 and 500 ng/g treatment groups. In contrast, fish exposed to progesterone associated with the silty loam sediments did not show a biological response at 7 d and only realized a significant reduction in vitellogenin at 14 d in the 50 and 500 ng/g groups. In both sediments, progesterone degradation resulted in the production of androgens including androsteinedione, testosterone, and androstadienedione, as well as the anti-estrogen, <b>testolactone.</b> Differences in compound fate resulted in organism exposure to different suites of metabolites either in water or associated with the sediment. Results from this study suggest that environmental progestagens will lead to defeminization at environmentally-relevant concentrations, and that exposure is influenced by sediment properties. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of androgens in establishing and maintaining sexual function in males of most species is well recognized. Estrogens also stimulate male sexual function in some species. In men, most studies of androgen effects on behavior have used hypogonadal men as an experimental model; much less {{is known about}} the role of endogenous testosterone (T) or estradiol (E 2) in the regulation of behavior in healthy, eugonadal men. In a randomized, double-blind study, we used a GnRH antagonist, Nal-Glu, without T replacement, to induce acute, profound, reversible gonadal steroid deficiency in 9 normal men for 6 weeks (Nal-Glu alone). We also studied the effects of partial androgen replacement by administering Nal-Glu together with T enanthate, 50 mg im weekly, to 10 other men. A third group of 10 men received Nal-Glu plus T, 100 mg im weekly. We studied the role of endogenous E 2 by administering Nal-Glu plus T, 100 mg im weekly, plus an aromatase inhibitor, <b>testolactone</b> (Teslac), 250 mg po qid, to 10 additional men (Nal - Glu + T + Teslac). Nine men received placebo injections and tablets. All subjects completed a behavioral questionnaire during the pretreatment period, at weeks 2, 4, and 6 of treatment, and at 3 weeks posttreatment. Men who received Nal-Glu alone became profoundly hypogonadal within 1 week after treatment began. Serum T levels did not change significantly in the controls and in the men who received full T replacement but decreased to approximately half the baseline level in men who received partial T replacement. E 2 levels decreased profoundly in men who received Nal-Glu alone or Nal - Glu + T + Teslac and to a lesser degree in men who received partial T replacement. In men who received Nal-Glu alone, there were clinically and statistically significant decreases in the frequency of sexual desire, sexual fantasies, and intercourse at 4 - 6 weeks. These men also showed a strong trend (P = 0. 55) towards decreased spontaneous erections after 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. A significant decrease in the frequency of masturbation was evident after 6 weeks. All measures returned to normal by posttreatment week 3. There was a trend toward increased aggression in the hypogonadal men, but this did not reach statistical significance. No changes in satisfaction or happiness with their partners were observed.
