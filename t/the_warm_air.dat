5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. <b>The</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
50|$|The system {{includes}} two primary components: a warming unit and a disposable blanket. <b>The</b> <b>warming</b> unit is {{connected by a}} flexible hose to <b>the</b> single-use blanket. <b>Warm</b> <b>air</b> from <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> unit passes through the flexible hose and into the blanket. Once <b>the</b> <b>warmed</b> <b>air</b> reaches <b>the</b> blanket it exits {{through a series of}} micro-perforations on the underside of <b>the</b> blanket, <b>warming</b> <b>the</b> patient's skin in an area not involved in the surgical procedure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1869 {{the company}} {{introduced}} the [...] "Sturtevant system," [...] still {{the basis for}} much interior heating of buildings. Sturtevant adapted hot blast technology for indoor heating, using ductwork to spread <b>the</b> <b>warmed</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{warm front}} is also {{defined as the}} {{transition}} zone where a <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> mass is replacing a cooler <b>air</b> mass. <b>Warm</b> fronts generally move from southwest to northeast. If <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> originates over <b>the</b> ocean, {{it is not only}} warmer but also more moist than the air ahead of it.|$|R
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, a {{heat pump}} uses an {{electric}} motor to drive a refrigeration cycle, that draws heat energy from a source such as the ground or outside air and directs that heat into the space to be warmed. Some systems can be reversed so that the interior space is cooled and <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is discharged outside or into the ground.|$|E
25|$|Autumn in the United Kingdom lasts from September to November. The {{season is}} notorious for being unsettledas cool polar air moves southwards {{following}} the sun, it meets <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> of the tropics and produces {{an area of}} great disturbance along which the country lies. This combined with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, produces the unsettled weather of autumn. In addition, when the air is particularly cold temperatures on land may be colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of condensation and clouds which bring rain to the country.|$|E
5000|$|It forms when a {{light wind}} of very cold air mixes with a shallow layer of {{saturated}} <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> immediately above <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> water. <b>The</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> is cooled beyond {{the dew point}} and can no longer hold as much water vapor, so the excess condenses out. The effect {{is similar to the}} [...] "steam" [...] produced over a hot bath or a hot drink, or even an exercising person.|$|R
50|$|These ice {{crystals}} usually form when a temperature inversion is {{present at the}} surface and <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> above <b>the</b> ground mixes with the colder air near <b>the</b> surface. Since <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> frequently contains more water vapor than colder air, this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air near the surface, causing the relative humidity of the near-surface air to increase. If the relative humidity increase near the surface is large enough then {{ice crystals}} may form.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along a {{stationary}} front, but usually clouds, prolonged precipitation, and storm trains are found there. When {{there is a lot}} of water vapor in <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> mass, significant amounts of rain or freezing rain can occur.|$|R
25|$|OTEC {{technology}} supports chilled-soil agriculture. When cold seawater {{flows through}} underground pipes, it chills the surrounding soil. The temperature difference between {{roots in the}} cool soil and leaves in <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> allows plants that evolved in temperate climates to be grown in the subtropics. Dr. John P. Craven, Dr. Jack Davidson and Richard Bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA). The research facility demonstrated that more than 100 different crops can be grown using this system. Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point.|$|E
25|$|Frontal and {{cyclonic}} lift {{occur when}} stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds {{over a wide}} area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> mass {{just ahead of the}} front.|$|E
25|$|Located on {{the east}} coast of Canada, Nova Scotia is almost entirely {{surrounded}} by the sea, which heavily influences the climate due to oncoming Atlantic storms. Due to the ocean's moderating effect Nova Scotia has cool summers as opposed to other cities in Canada around the same latitude. Nova Scotia's maritime climate is influenced by the cold air masses passing from the centre of Canada and <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Winters can be very severe, blizzards occur several times each winter. Winters are cold compared with other coastal cities on the same latitude because the direction of the Atlantic currents are going east to Europe.|$|E
50|$|Pannus {{clouds are}} formed as <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> (and often more moist) updraft of a {{thunderstorm}} lifts <b>the</b> relatively <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> near <b>the</b> surface. These clouds condense as <b>the</b> <b>warm,</b> moist <b>air</b> saturates through ascent and is pushed {{outward from the}} storm. Scud clouds are very commonly found {{on the leading edge}} of a storm front. In this area of a storm, scud are commonly associated with shelf clouds.|$|R
50|$|The {{energy source}} for {{baroclinic}} instability {{is the potential}} energy in the environmental flow. As the instability grows, the center of mass of the fluid is lowered. In growing waves in the atmosphere, cold air moving downwards and equatorwards displaces <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> moving polewards and upwards.|$|R
50|$|When {{masses of}} air with {{different}} density (moisture and temperature characteristics) meet, less dense <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> overrides colder <b>air.</b> <b>The</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> {{is forced to}} rise and if conditions are right becomes saturated, causing precipitation. In turn, precipitation can enhance the temperature and moisture contrast along a frontal boundary. Passing weather fronts cause sudden changes in general temperature, and in the humidity and pressure {{in the air at}} ground level.|$|R
25|$|The Atlantic Ocean to {{the west}} and the Eurasian {{continent}} to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. The warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current, which warm Norway and Sweden, also warm Finland. Westerly winds bring <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> currents into the Baltic areas and to the country's shores, moderating winter temperatures, especially in the south. These winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. By contrast, the continental high pressure system situated over the Eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and high temperatures in the summer.|$|E
500|$|Warm fronts {{mark the}} {{position}} on the Earth's surface where a relatively warm body of air has displaced colder air. The temperature increase {{is located on the}} equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within broader low pressure troughs than is the case with cold fronts. Warm fronts move more slowly than do the cold fronts because cold air is denser, and harder to displace from the Earth's surface. This causes temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. <b>The</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> mass overrides the cold air mass and temperature changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface. [...] Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. Fog can also occur preceding a warm front passage. Clearing and warming is usually rapid after the passage of a warm front. If <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> mass is unstable, mixing of the warm moist air will produce thunderstorms that are embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage, thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of travel.|$|E
500|$|When the air {{has little}} {{moisture}} or when an inversion stops <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> from rising high {{enough for the}} moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or dust devils to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals {{can be found in}} the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires.|$|E
50|$|Stack {{ventilation}} - Cross ventilation is {{an effective}} cooling strategy, however, wind is an unreliable resource. Stack ventilation is an alternative design strategy that relies on <b>the</b> buoyancy of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> to rise and exit through openings located at ceiling height. Cooler outside <b>air</b> replaces <b>the</b> rising <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> through carefully designed inlets placed near the floor.|$|R
50|$|Linked Hybrid {{makes use}} of a {{technique}} called displacement ventilation, in which air that is slightly below desired temperature in a room is released from the floor. The cooler <b>air</b> displaces <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air,</b> causing it {{to be released from}} the room and resulting in a cooler overall space and a fresh breathing environment.|$|R
50|$|Today, many {{manufacturers}} also {{augment the}} operation of fireplace inserts by offering features such as fans and thermostatic controls, depending on the fuel type. Typically, fresh air enters through vents below, circulates around the main chamber, where it is heated up, and <b>the</b> <b>warmed</b> <b>air</b> then exits through vents {{on the top of}} the unit.|$|R
500|$|This also forces {{temperature}} {{differences across}} warm fronts to be broader in scale. [...] Clouds {{ahead of the}} warm front are mostly stratiform, and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. [...] Fog can also occur preceding a warm frontal passage.

500|$|In {{areas where}} the wind flow is light, sea breezes and land breezes are {{important}} factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun to a greater depth than the land due to its greater specific heat. [...] The sea therefore has a greater capacity for absorbing heat than the land, so {{the surface of the}} sea warms up more slowly than the land's surface. [...] As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it. [...] <b>The</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is less dense and so it rises.

500|$|The {{dry line}} is the {{boundary}} between dry and moist air masses east of mountain ranges with similar orientation to the Rockies, depicted {{at the leading edge}} of the dew point, or moisture, gradient. Near <b>the</b> surface, <b>warm</b> moist <b>air</b> that is denser than <b>warmer,</b> dryer <b>air</b> wedges under the drier air in a manner similar to that of a cold front wedging under <b>warmer</b> <b>air.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> moist <b>air</b> wedged under the drier mass heats up, it becomes less dense and rises and sometimes forms thunderstorms. [...] At higher altitudes, <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> moist <b>air</b> is less dense than the cooler, drier air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> {{nearer to}} <b>the</b> surface expands, {{becoming}} less dense than the surrounding air. The lighter air rises and cools {{due to its}} expansion in the lower pressure at higher altitudes. It stops rising when it has cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding air. Dark earth, urban areas, and roadways are good sources of thermals.|$|R
500|$|In coastal regions, sea breezes {{and land}} breezes can be {{important}} factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater specific heat compared to land. As {{the temperature of the}} surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. <b>The</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea.

500|$|One of Heinkel's rivals, Junkers, built 40 He 111Ps at Dessau. In October 1938, the Junkers Central Administration commented:Apparent are the {{externally}} poor, less carefully designed components {{at various}} locations, {{especially at the}} junction between the empennage and the rear fuselage. All parts have an impression of being very weak.... The visible flexing in the wing must also be very high. The left and right powerplants are interchangeable. Each motor has an exhaust-gas heater on one side, {{but it is not}} connected to the fuselage since it is probable that ... <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> in the fuselage is not free of carbon monoxide (CO). The fuselage is not subdivided into individual segments, but is attached over its entire length, after completion, to the wing centre section. Outboard of the powerplants, the wings are attached by universal joints. The latter can in no way be satisfactory and have been the cause of several failures.|$|E
5000|$|A {{marine layer}} is an air mass which {{develops}} {{over the surface}} of a large body of water such as the ocean or large lake {{in the presence of a}} temperature inversion. The inversion itself is usually initiated by the cooling effect of the water on the surface layer of an otherwise <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> mass. [...] As it cools, the surface air becomes denser than <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> above it, and thus becomes trapped below it. The layer may thicken through turbulence generated within the developing marine layer itself. It may also thicken if <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> above it is lifted by an approaching area of low pressure. The layer will also gradually increase its humidity by evaporation of the ocean or lake surface, as well as by the effect of cooling itself. Fog will form within a marine layer where the humidity is high enough and cooling sufficient to produce condensation. Stratus and stratocumulus will also form at the top of a marine layer in the presence of the same conditions there.|$|R
50|$|The Department of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence has a Mediterranean {{climate in}} the lower valleys under one {{thousand}} metres in altitude and an alpine climate in the high valleys, such as the valleys of the Blanche, the Haut Verdon and the Ubaye, which are over 2500 metres high. The alpine climate in the higher mountains is moderated by <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> from <b>the</b> Mediterranean.|$|R
50|$|The system {{extracts}} {{moisture from}} the South China Sea and sometimes the Bay of Bengal. <b>The</b> low-level <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is lifted by the low level jet on the equator side of the baroclinic zone.
