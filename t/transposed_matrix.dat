A less trivial example is the set Matn(B) of square matrices over a boolean algebra B, where the matrices are ordered pointwise. The pointwise order endows Matn(B) with pointwise meets, joins and complements. Matrix multiplication is defined in the usual manner with the [...] "product" [...] being a meet, and the [...] "sum" [...] a join. It can be shown that X\Y = (YtX’)’ and X/Y = (X’Yt)’, where (X’ is the complement of X, and Yt is the <b>transposed</b> <b>matrix).</b>|$|E

In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} way to produce an initial <b>transposed</b> <b>matrix</b> for two point clouds, which can effectively avoid the drawback of local optimism caused by using standard Iterative Closest Points(ICP) [1] algorithm when matching two point clouds. In our approach, the correspondences used to calculate the <b>transposed</b> <b>matrix</b> are confirmed before the point cloud forms. We use the depth images which have been carefully target-segmented to find the boundaries of the shapes that reflect different views of the same target object. Then each contour is affected by curvature scale space(CSS) [2] method to find a sequence of characteristic points. After that, our method is applied on these characteristic points to find the most matching pairs of points. Finally, we convert the matched characteristic points to 3 D points, and the correspondences are there being confirmed. We can use them to compute an initial <b>transposed</b> <b>matrix</b> to tell the computer which part of the first point cloud should be matched to the second. In this way, we put the two point clouds in a correct initial location, so that the local optimism of ICP and its variations can be excluded...|$|E
