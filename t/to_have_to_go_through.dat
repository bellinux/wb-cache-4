25|$|Although {{access to}} {{judicial}} review is restricted for ordinary questions of law, the Court of Justice has gradually developed {{a more open}} approach to standing for human rights. Human rights have also become essential in the proper interpretation and construction of all EU law. If there are two or more plausible interpretations of a rule, the one which is most consistent with human rights should be chosen. The Treaty of Lisbon 2007 made rights underpin the Court of Justice's competence, and required the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, overseen by the external Strasbourg Court. Initially, reflecting its primitive economic nature, the treaties made no reference to rights. However, in 1969 particularly after concern from Germany, the Court of Justice declared in Stauder v City of Ulm that 'fundamental human rights' were 'enshrined in the general principles of Community law'. This meant that Mr Stauder, who received subsidised butter under an EU welfare scheme only by showing a coupon with his name and address, was entitled to claim that this violated his dignity: he was entitled not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the humiliation of proving his identity to get food. While those 'general principles' were not written down in EU law, and simply declared to exist by the court, it accords with a majority philosophical view that 'black letter' rules, or positive law, necessarily exist for reasons that the society which made them wants: these give rise to principles, which inform the law's purpose. Moreover, the Court of Justice has clarified that its recognition of rights was 'inspired' by member states' own 'constitutional traditions', and international treaties. These include rights found in member state constitutions, bills of rights, foundational Acts of Parliament, landmark court cases, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Social Charter 1961, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, or the International Labour Organization's Conventions. The EU itself must accede to the ECHR, although in '’Opinion 2/13'’ the Court of Justice delayed, because of perceived difficulties in retaining an appropriate balance of competences.|$|E

We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves."

I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”.

60|$|The Boy's Town {{was built}} on two sides of a river. Mr. Bushell's store was {{across the river from}} where the Bakers lived, and she said she did not want the child <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the bridge after dark. Perhaps it was her anxiety about this that began the whole trouble; for when the driver came with the carriage, she could not help asking him if he was sure to get home before sundown. That made him drive faster than he might have done, perhaps; at any rate, he set off at a quick trot after Mr. Bushell had helped put the two boys in. Mrs. Baker {{gathered}} her little girls together {{and went back to the}} boat with her heart in her mouth, as she afterwards said.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{nuisance}} to which no man should subject himself in any weather. But {{when it rains}} there is superadded a squalor and an ill humour to all the party which makes it almost impossible for them not to quarrel before the day is over. To talk politics to Mrs. Bubbs under any circumstances is bad, {{but to do so}} with the conviction that the moisture is penetrating from your greatcoat through your shirt to your bones, and that while so employed you are breathing the steam from those seven other wet men at the door, is abominable. <b>To</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this is enough to take away all the pride which a man might otherwise take from becoming a member of Parliament. But to go through it and then not to become a member is base indeed! To go through it and to feel that you are probably paying at the rate of a hundred pounds a day for the privilege is most disheartening. Silverbridge, as he backed up Tregear in the uncomfortable work, congratulated himself on the comfort of having a Mr. Sprugeon and a Mr. Sprout who could manage his borough for him without a contest.|$|E

60|$|Thus he indicated, delicately, that {{it would}} be better for me to keep out of sight. On my way to the Potts House the bizarre {{elements}} in the situation struck me again with considerable force. It seemed so ridiculous, so puerile <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with this political farce in order that a natural economic evolution might be achieved. Without doubt the development of certain industries had reached a stage where the units in competition had become too small, when a greater concentration of capital was necessary. Curiously enough, in this mental argument of justification, I left out all consideration of the size of the probable profits to Mr. Scherer and his friends. Profits and brains went together. And, since the Almighty did not limit the latter, why should man attempt to limit the former? We were playing for high but justifiable stakes; and I resented the comedy which an hypocritical insistence on the forms of democracy compelled us to go through. It seemed unworthy of men who controlled the destinies of state and nation. The point of view, however, was consoling. As the day wore on I sat in the Colonel's room, admiring the skill with which he conducted the campaign: a green country lawyer had been got to introduce the bill, it had been expedited to the Committee on the Judiciary, which would have an executive session immediately after dinner. I had ventured to inquire about the hearings.|$|E

50|$|After {{the kingdom}} of Israel was split into two kingdoms {{on the death of}} King Solomon (c.931 BC), Jeroboam, the first king of the {{northern}} Kingdom of Israel, made two calves of gold (1 Kings 12:28 ff) and set one up in Bethel, and the other in Dan in the far north of his kingdom. This was apparently to make it unnecessary for the people of Israel <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem to worship in the temple there.

30|$|Despite {{using this}} principle, {{it is still}} {{expected}} {{that a large number}} of factories and datasets will be defined and it can be difficult to keep track of which ones are available. This can be supported by good documentation of the software. To facilitate this, we automated the process of documentation, so that as the model is growing, so is the documentation. Documentation is not only useful for the programmer who would like to add a new plugin for example, but also for the user who will not have access to the code, and who will not want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> it. We have used annotations on asset and behaviour factories and on the methods within the classes that are used for input parameters. These annotations are discovered automatically by the documentation generator, and used to generate consistent documentation for the parameters and required data providers of each factory.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Hackers who gain root {{privilege}} on {{a computer}} system usually want to maintain this level of privilege for future exploits. They do not want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the steps to regain this level of privilege because of the effort involved and the increased risk of being discovered {{as well as the}} possibility that the original exploit used to gain root access gets patched. A hacker who gains access to a system will install some method for use at a later time allowing the hacker to come back onto the system with root privilege. The hacker accomplishes this by the installation of some type of software known as a backdoor or a Trojan. One type of Trojan is known as a rootkit, in which specific system binaries necessary for the day-to-day operation of the computer system are modified or replaced by the hacker. These binaries still maintain their original functionality while allowing the hacker to maintain the ability to operate clandestinely on the host system. We propose a methodology for determining the unique signatures of common rootkits and how to determine if a compromised system is infected with a new unknown or modified previously known rootkit.
