50|$|Mastitis {{occurs when}} {{white blood cells}} (leukocytes) are {{released}} into the mammary gland, usually in response to bacteria invading the <b>teat</b> <b>canal.</b> Milk-secreting tissue and various ducts throughout the mammary gland are damaged due to toxins released by the bacteria. Mastitis can also occur {{as a result of}} chemical, mechanical, or thermal injury.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{possible}} with long-acting antibiotics, but milk from such cows is not marketable until drug residues {{have left the}} cow's system. Antibiotics may be systemic (injected into the body), {{or they may be}} forced upwards into the teat through the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> (intramammary infusion). Cows being treated may be marked with tape to alert dairy workers, and their milk is syphoned off and discarded. To determine whether the levels of antibiotic residuals are within regulatory requirements, special tests exist. Vaccinations for mastitis are available, but as they only reduce the severity of the condition, and cannot prevent reoccurring infections, they should be used in conjunction with a mastitis prevention program.|$|E
50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{work in a}} {{way that}} is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow. The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio.|$|E

Incidence of new intramammary infection (IMI) and teat open/closed status was assessed at 7, 14 and 21 days after DO. Keratin plug formation was determined on a subset of 40 cows at 7 and 14 days after DO. Number of clinical mastitis (CM) cases and total new IMI did not differ between cows maintained on unrestricted or restricted DMI. However Streptococcus uberis was isolated from more new IMI in unrestricted animals than restricted animals (11. 7 % vs. 4. 6 % of quarters respectively; P < 0. 01). At 7 and 14 days after DO, more teats were classified as open in the unrestricted group compared to the restricted animals (57 % vs. 43 % of quarters respectively; P < 0. 01). However weight of keratin collected from <b>teat</b> <b>canals</b> did not differ between nutritional treatments. Results suggest that unrestricted nutrition after DO did not increase risk of CM but does increase risk of S. uberis infection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{morphological}} changes in teats of sheep and changes in size of sheep udder, occurring as a reaction to subsequent lactation, stage of lactation and daily milk yield. Another aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of 10 MHz ultrasound linear probe in examination of changes in morphological structures of ewe teat. Investigations were conducted on 40 Polish dairy sheep line 05, sheep ranged in age from 1 to 9 years old (1 to 8 lactation). The width and length of teat, as well as its anatomical structures: the thickness of teat walls and length and diameter of <b>teat</b> <b>canals,</b> were measured on ultrasound images. Results were verified statistically taking into consideration: the daily milk yield, subsequent lactation (age of ewe) and the stage of lactation. The effect was found of subsequent lactation and increasing milk yield on the growth of the udder.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) {{mastitis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common bacterial infections in dairy cattle. S. aureus is a gram-positive bacterial pathogen that infects the host by entering the udders and <b>teat</b> <b>canals.</b> The bacterium is contagious and does not respond to frontline antibiotics. S. aureus also has variation in strains that secrete a variety of toxins. A S. aureus vaccine would prevent the dependence of antibiotic treatment and increase the quality of the dairy milk. Clumping factor A (ClfA), a S. aureus adhesin, is a fibrinogen-binding factor found on the surface of S. aureus and is a promising vaccine candidate. In this project, we are combining the non-toxigenic CTA 2 /B from Vibrio cholerae with ClfA to form ClfA-CTA 2 /B fusions. Isolation of ClfA was performed using isolates of S. aureus related to MRSA 252. ClfA-CTA 2 /B chimeras are isolated from E. coli periplasm and purified using D-galactose agarose resin. An intranasal ClfA-CTA 2 /B chimera was used to vaccinate 21 dairy cows. Serum and milk samples were analyzed by ELISA for anti-ClfA IgG/IgA responses.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the interrelation between teat anatomy and machine milking in dairy buffaloes raised in Switzerland. A 3 -min pre-stimulation induced milk ejection before cluster attachment in most cases and caused an optimal milk removal during machine milking. In an additional experiment, longitudinal cross-section ultrasound was obtained before and after a 3 -min pre-stimulation. Teat wall thickness, teat diameter, cisternal diameter and <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> length were evaluated. It was observed that 3 -min pre-stimulation dramatically reduced <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> length whereas all the other anatomical parameters remained unchanged. The vacuum needed to open the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> was also measured before and after a 3 -min pre-stimulation by using a special teat cup with only the mouthpiece of the liner remaining {{on the top of the}} teat cup (no liner, no pulsation). Without pre-stimulation but after wetting the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> by stripping one squirt of milk out of the teat, no milk could be withdrawn with a vacuum up to 39 kPa. However, after pre-stimulation, milk flow occurred in all buffaloes at a vacuum between 16 and 38 kPa. In the last experiment, the teat tissue was examined in slaughtered buffaloes and compared with teat tissue of cows. No difference was noted in histological sections and <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> length was similar in cows and buffaloes. Proximal to the <b>teat</b> <b>canal,</b> the teat did not pass into an open cistern but the lumen was collapsed. In conclusion, buffaloes need to be well pre-stimulated because the tissue above the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> provides additional teat closure before milk ejection.

40|$|Samples of 24 mammary glands from healthy one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) cows were {{investigated}} under different physiological conditions for their gross and light microscopic anatomy. Different groups included {{equal number of}} immature heifers, mature heifers, lactating and non-lactating animals. Tissues fixed in 10 % NBF were processed as per routine and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Massons trichome. Morphometry {{was done with the}} help of stage and ocular micrometer. Gross studies revealed that the camel's udder consists of four quarters. The udder and teat showed light brown to solid black tinge in colour. The tips of teats sloped to a point both in immature and mature animals, however, the conformation of teats turned rounded at the tips in lactating camels. Each teat possessed two <b>teat</b> <b>canals.</b> The dimensions of <b>teat</b> and streak <b>canal</b> varied markedly among four different groups. Number of Furestenberg's rosettes ranged from 11. 6 to 13. 6. Microscopic studies revealed that streak canal was lined by stratified squamous keratinized epithelium that was partially extremely thin in some parts. Cutaneous layer of teat was devoid of hair follicles except at the base of teat. Follicles were associated with sebaceous glands. Sweat glands were less coiled and showed a wide acinous element forming the part of excretory duct. Glomus organs occurred in the stratum profundum of the corium {{as well as in the}} subcutis of the skin of mammary gland. They also revealed great variation in structure and size. Epithelial lining of the alveoli varied from flattened to columnar according to physiological state.

Selected isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing and PCR analysis for genes encoding hemolysins (hla to hlg), leukocidins (lukED and lukM), superantigens (sea, sec, sed, seg to seo, seu, and tst), adhesins (fnbA and fnbB), and penicillin and methicillin resistance (blaZ and mecA). S. aureus was found throughout the herds in 94 % of the cows. Nine PFGE types were found, with the herds each having their own predominant type and sharing one type. The degree of diversity of PFGE types in herd II, which integrated foreign heifers, was higher than that in herd I. For both herds, {{the majority of the}} PFGE-typed isolates both from milk and from extramammary sites represented the predominant PFGE types. In isolates from herd I, the most prevalent genes were hla-hlg, lukED, and fnbA; in those from herd II, they were hla, hld, hlg, lukED, and fnbA. The other genes were pulsotype linked within the herds. The predominant PFGE types carried both fnbA and fnbB; only fnbA was detected in the other PFGE types. No connection between specific virulence genes and the origins of isolates was found. The results suggest that for the two herds, most S. aureus isolates from extramammary sites were indistinguishable from the isolates infecting the mammary gland and that those sites can thus act as origins and reservoirs of intramammary infections. However, contamination in the opposite direction cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical {{characteristics}} of dairy cattle are not equal for all breeds, {{meaning that the}} morphological traits of udder and teats could favor an individual performance or a determined breed. Changes in teat tissue after machine milking occur because of the negative influence of the vacuum and mechanical forces of the teat cup liner. Duration and performance of machine milking also depend on the udder and teat conformation and milkability traits of cows. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the differences in morphological {{characteristics of}} Simmental and Holstein cows before and after machine milking, as well as to elaborate the differences in some of milkability traits of the cows during process of milking. A correlation (from - 0. 30 to 0. 37) was determined between exterior and interior traits of teats and the performance of milkability traits. In both cow breeds, statistically significant difference (p< 0. 0001) was found between the pre- and post-milking values in all investigated traits, with exception of teat end width. Holstein cows had significantly (p< 0. 001) higher amount of milk per milking, maximum and average milk flow, while cows of the Simmental breed had longer milking time duration, but without statistical significance. In comparison to Holstein breed, results of internal morphological traits of teats showed that cows of Simmental breed had longer <b>teat</b> <b>canals</b> and wider <b>teat</b> ends for both front and rear teats. Holstein breed compared to Simmental had thinner teats wall, but wider teat cistern. If compared to pre-milking stage, differences in teat cistern width and teat wall thickness that occur after milking were more expressed in the Holstein breed than in Simmental. Simmental cows had significantly (p< 0. 05) longer and wider rear teats. Future research should focus on proving the differences in changes of teat tissue due to milking between different groups of cows, as depending on the milk flow. Ultrasound method of recording can be applied in such assessment. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe bovine <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> {{provides}} the first-line of defence against pathogenic bacteria infecting the mammary gland, yet the protein composition and host-defence functionality of the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> lining (TCL) {{are not well}} characterised. In this study, TCL collected from six healthy lactating dairy cows was subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) and mass spectrometry. The abundance and location of selected identified proteins were determined by western blotting and fluorescence immunohistochemistry. The variability of abundance among individual cows was also investigated. Two dominant clusters of proteins were detected in the TCL, comprising members of the keratin and S 100 families of proteins.

40|$|Incontinentia lactis is a {{possible}} predisposing factor for an elevated level of intramammary infection. The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate possible causes of incontinentia lactis in dairy cows. Two farms that differed in breed composition, but that had similar average milk yields were studied: herd A, 28 kg/d, 31 Red Holstein cows; and herd B, 26 kg/d, 16 Brown Swiss cows. Herd A was classified into 2 groups: incontinentia lactis (ILA group) and control, whereas herd B was exclusively a control herd. Milk samples that represented foremilk and the main milk fraction were collected during 4 milking sessions. In addition, milk leakage samples from the ILA group were collected at different time intervals from 0 to 5 h before milking. Measurements of the teat, milk flow, fractions of cisternal and alveolar milk, intramammary pressure, and blood oxytocin pattern also were obtained. The ILA cows did not have differences in fat content between milk leakage and cisternal milk fraction. Milk fat content, however, increased during milking in response to continuous milk ejection (1. 95, 1. 99, and 4. 61 % for milk leakage, cisternal, and main milk samples, respectively). <b>Teat</b> <b>canals</b> were 9 % shorter in the ILA cows, which showed greater milk yield, peak, and average flow rates. Quarter cisternal milk yield of ILA cows tended to be greater (0. 50 vs. 0. 23 and 0. 28 kg for ILA and controls from herds A and B, respectively), whereas percentages of cistern milk and alveolar milk did not differ from controls. The greater pressure in the ILA group, both before and after manual udder stimulation (ILA: 4. 0 and 6. 4 kPa; control: 2. 0 and 5. 0 kPa, respectively), could be an important cause for the leakage. Nevertheless, the increase in IMP that occurred after udder preparation affirms that milk ejection occurred in response to the tactile teat stimulation, but not before the onset of leakage. Blood oxytocin concentration in ILA cows was low until the start of udder preparation and increased in response to the milking stimulus (reaffirming the hypothesis that milk leakage occurred in the absence of milk ejection). In conclusion, milk losses by leakage are likely due to the large amount of cisternal milk, which creates pressure and causes leakage, in the absence of milk ejection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{investigate}} some of the underlying principles for milking management of Murrah buffaloes. The study was carried out through five experiments, four on an experimental farm in India and one as a field survey. From the results {{it was observed that}} the total cisternal area and cisternal fraction of milk in Murrah buffaloes was smaller than in dairy cattle, sheep and goat. Teats were longer and thicker and had longer <b>teat</b> <b>canals</b> than reported in dairy cattle. Teats were flaccid and empty prior to milk ejection due to the small cisternal fraction of milk, while during milk ejection there was a remarkable increase in teat dimensions and cisternal area. Commencement of milk flow during machine milking took longer without pre-stimulation than in the other dairy species due to the small cisternal fraction of milk. The combined stimulation of feeding during milking and manual pre-stimulation resulted in a faster and more pronounced release of oxytocin, prolactin and cortisol compared to milking with only manual pre-stimulation and no pre-stimulation. Small changes in the milking routines adversely effect oxytocin release, milk ejection and complete removal of milk, which was also reflected in the stripping yield and fat percent in stripping milk. The daily rhythm of maintenance behaviour of buffaloes with mechanisation of some farm chores was comparable to those without mechanisation. However, increased access to roughage increased the resting behaviour and the animals ate longer during the night as well. The milking management systems and the herd size {{had an impact on the}} udder health status of buffaloes. The prevalence of mastitis was lower in the small buffalo farms where buffaloes were stimulated by calf suckling and hand milked compared to large farms where the buffaloes were manually pre-stimulated and hand milked or machine milked. In conclusion, during machine milking of buffaloes owing to the small cisternal milk fraction, attaching the milking cluster prior to milk ejection could lead to higher teat penetration in the teat cup and milking on empty teats. To prevent a possible irritation and stress due to machine milking without milk flow at high vacuum, milk removal should be synchronised with milk ejection. It is thus necessary to improve machine milking settings for buffaloes and to develop ISO standards optimised to suit the anatomical and physiological characteristics of buffaloes. Training of milkers and milking machine users is also important for improving the udder health and welfare of buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of urea in milk (MUC) {{has emerged as}} a potentially useful tool to predict urinary N excretion. Various factors may affect the relationship between MUC and urinary N excretion, including transport characteristics of urea from blood to milk and vice versa. The main objective {{of this study was to}} test whether substantial transport of urea from milk to blood exists in lactating dairy cattle. The subobjectives were (1) to assess the effects of various urea gradient levels between blood and milk on urea transport from milk to blood and (2) to test the occurrence of urea transport between different compartments of the mammary gland such as the cistern and the alveoli. Urea transport was studied in 2 multiparous lactating Holstein-Friesian cows (36. 0 ± 6. 18 kg of milk/d; mean ± SD). In 3 separate trials, boluses of [15 N 15 N]urea were injected in the cisterns via the <b>teat</b> <b>canals</b> at 20, 60, and 120 min before the 1700 -h milking at various levels of MUC and of blood plasma urea concentration (PUC). In trial 1, a primed continuous infusion of urea (105 g at the start, continuing with 20 g/h) into the jugular vein started at 0500 h and stopped at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h before the 1700 -h milking on d 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In trial 2, 5. 5 g of urea was injected into the cisterns at 20, 60, and 120 min before the 1700 -h milking on d 5, 6, and 7, respectively. In trial 3, urea fluxes were measured without an experimentally induced gradient between MUC and PUC on d 8, 9, and 10, respectively. During milking, successive milk samples were taken from first to last milk. Blood and milk were analyzed for 15 N-urea enrichment. Levels of 15 N-urea in blood increased after injection of a [15 N 15 N]urea bolus in milk, indicating urea transport from milk to blood. Between 21. 0 and 35. 3 % of injected [15 N 15 N]urea in milk was recovered after 2 h. The fractional [15 N 15 N]urea decline rate in milk varied between 0. 0076 and 0. 0096 /min. The level of MUC, rather than the concentration gradient between MUC and PUC, appeared to affect this fractional rate of decline. Enrichment levels of 15 N-urea in milk samples within a single milking showed that urea was transported from cistern milk to alveoli milk. In conclusion, the results indicate that transport of urea from milk to blood in lactating dairy cattle occurs and that urea is transported from cistern milk to alveoli milk...|$|R

40|$|The <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> is {{the primary}} {{physical}} and chemical barrier to invasion of mastitis pathogens into the udder (Hamann, 1987).

40|$|Ultrasound {{image of}} {{morphological}} changes of teat end in sheep caused by machine milking A total of 29 ewes with an approx. 90 % share of East Friesian dairy sheep genes in their genotype were investigated. Ultrasound images of teats were recorded 4 times daily: before {{and immediately after}} the morning milking, and next 4 and 10 h after milking. The diameter and length of the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> and {{the thickness of the}} teat wall were measured on recorded images. The adopted method of ultrasound teat diagnostics made it possible to effectively monitor changes in internal teat structures caused in sheep by mechanical milking. The reaction of the teat tissue to milking was manifested in a significant increase in length, diameter or thickness of the analyzed structures (P< 0. 01; P< 0. 05). The most marked morphological changes were observed 4 h after milking. The effect was found of successive lactation and udder type on the levels of analyzed morphological traits of the teat. Both the thickness of the teat wall and the length of the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> increased with the age of animals and successive lactations (P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{accuracy of}} conventional methods for {{the diagnosis of}} subclinical mastitis, such as the direct microscopic count (DMC) and electronic cell count (ECC) either used alone or in combination with bacteriological examinations, according to international standards, were compared with DNA determinations and a radial immunodiffusion test (MMT). The latter is based on single radial immunodiffusion of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in agarose containing anti-BSA serum. This investigation was conducted on 1 008 foremilk samples, collected via the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> from 179 dairy cows, plus 56 samples obtained from 14 of them by means of cisternal puncture. It is concluded that BSA concentrations in milk causing an MMT diameter ≥ 8 mm are diagnostic for mastitis in lactating cows under the conditions existing in this experiment. The coefficient of variation of the MMT (14, 67 %) is significantly smaller {{than that of the}} DMC (87, 78 %), ECC (72, 25 %) and DNA content (37, 19 %) respectively and lies within the 15 % limit recommended for diagnostic methods. Diagnoses made by MMT, DMC and ECC over 3 successive days varied by 4, 1 %; 14, 5 % or 28, 4 % respectively. The reduced repeatability of the MMT resulted from genuine changes in udder health whereas 10, 1 % and 24, 3 % of variance observed for the DMC and ECC respectively were due to other factors. In comparison to the MMT, mastitis diagnosis based on international standards resulted in 43, 13 ± 20, 8 % false positives. These are mainly due to <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> infections simulating mastitis. When both the MMT and international mastitis standards were used it was possible to distinguish between quarters with irrelevant and relevant <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> infections, non-specific cellular reactions and septic or aseptic mastitis without having to resort to cisternal puncture. Staphylococcal beta toxin inoculated into the <b>teat</b> <b>canal,</b> facilitated studies on the sequence of events leading to elevated BSA levels and cellular counts in the udder. A pre-inflammatory leucocytosis, resulting from passage of small amounts of toxin into the teat cistern was shown to occur in this investigation. The diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dry cows and within the first week post parium is as inaccurate by means of the MMT as by conventional methods.

40|$|Although Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci are {{frequently}} {{the most commonly}} isolated bacteria from milk samples submitted for identification of pathogens causing intramammary infection, the individual quarter somatic cell count (SCC) from those samples is most often low. The present study aimed at evaluating the difference in bacteriology results from milk sampled by the standard technique (as recommended by the National Mastitis Council) and {{by the use of}} a teat cannula surpassing the <b>teat</b> <b>canal,</b> since C. bovis is often only found in the <b>teat</b> <b>canal.</b> Single quarter milk samples were collected in duplicate from 132 dairy cows on a commercial dairy farm using the standard milk sampling technique and also using a cannula introduced into the teat. Two groups of quarters were sampled: a group that was selected randomly at cow and quarter level and a group that was selected based on having SCC > 200 000 cells/ml at the previous milk recording at cow level and on California mastitis test result at quarter level. Bacteriological culture performed on the samples yielded 29 Corynebacterium spp. isolates from the samples collected with the standard technique and 6 isolates from the samples collected with a cannula. Bacteriological culture yielded 73 and 100 culture negative samples respectively with the standard and the alternative sampling technique. A significant difference between the two sampling techniques was observed for recovery of Corynebacterium spp. and for no-growth samples. There {{was no significant difference in}} the isolation of Corynebacterium spp. or other bacterial species when using the standard technique before or after sampling with the cannula; thus the observed difference in bacteriology results could not be attributed to a particular sampling order. No significant change was observed overall in individual quarter SCC measured on the sampling day and 7 d later. Our results agree with several studies showing that Corynebacterium bovis often colonizes the <b>teat</b> <b>canal,</b> without causing true intramammary infection...|$|E
40|$|Influence of <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> keratin on {{susceptibility}} to intramammary infection {{was investigated in}} lactating Jersey cows. In each of two replicate trials, keratin {{was removed from the}} left teats of 20 cows immediately before milking. Immediately after milking, all teats were exposed to bacterial challenge by immersion in a suspension of Streptococcus agalactiae (5 X 10 (7) cfu/ml). Bacterial challenge was repeated after the next four milkings. Foremilk samples were obtained for 8 d after keratin removal to determine infection status. A mammary quarter was classified as infected based solely upon the bacteriological criteria outlined by the National Mastitis Council. The rate of infection in quarters from which keratin was removed was greater than that in control quarters. Infection, rates were 26. 3 % for keratin-removed quarters and 8. 3 % for control quarters in trial 1 and 13. 5 and 0 %, respectively, in trial 2. When more stringent criteria (recovery of > 100 cfu of S. agalactiae/ml in three or more successive milk samples and a SCC of > 10 (6)) were used to identify a subset of infections that were clearly intramammary, infection rates were 9. 3 % for keratin-removed quarters and 1. 4 % for control quarters. Thus, partial removal of keratin from the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> compromised the ability of the teat to prevent passage of bacterial pathogens from the external environment into the mammary gland...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Eight Danish Holstein cows were milked with a 1 -mm thick {{specially}} designed soft liner on their right rear teat {{and a standard}} liner mounted under extra high tension on their left rear teat. Four of the animals were overmilked for 5 min. Rear teats were subjected to ultrasound examination {{on the first day}} and to infrared thermography on the second day. Teats were submersed in ethanol 20 min post-milking on the second day. Ultrasonography measurements showed that <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> length increased by 30 – 41 % during milking. Twenty minutes after milking, teats milked with modified standard liners still had elongated teat canals while teats milked with the soft liner were normalized. Overmilking tended to increase teat wall thickness. Approximately 80 % of variability in <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> length, from before teat preparation to after milking, could be explained by changes during teat preparation. Thermography indicated a general drop in teat temperature during teat preparation. Teat temperature increased during milking and continued to increase until the ethanol challenge induced a significant drop. Temperatures approached pre-challenge rather than pre-milking temperatures within 10 minutes after challenge. Teat temperatures were dependent on type of liner. Mid-teat temperatures post-challenge relative to pre-teat preparation were dependent on overmilking. Thermography and ultrasound were considered useful methods to indirectly and non invasively evaluate teat tissue integrity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate lipid composition of <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> keratin when different conditions of bacterial colonization and quarter inflammation were present. In Experiment 1, 11 multiparous cows with subclinical mastitis (bacteria present but no visible inflammation) {{in at least one}} quarter were selected for study. Quarters that were sampled and found negative for bacterial growth were classified as control. In Experiment 2, 10 multiparous cows with clinical mastitis in one or more quarters were selected. Milk samples from inflamed quarters were cultured to identify mastitis pathogens; these quarters were classified as clinical; all other quarters were classified as control. <b>Teat</b> <b>canal</b> keratin was collected from all quarters just before an a. m. milking, samples were weighed and lipid determinations were conducted by TLC. Keratin from subclinical quarters compared with keratin from control quarters did not differ in either neutral lipid or fatty acid composition. Total lipid was significantly higher in keratin from teats of clinical quarters than in keratin from control quarters (27. 8 vs. 21. 5 -mu-g/mg). Neutral lipid composition of keratin was similar between teats from clinical quarters and teats from control quarters. In Experiment 2, quarter foremilk samples were also obtained to determine lipid composition. The FFA in milk from clinical quarters contained fewer short-chain fatty acids, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in milk from clinical quarters...|$|E
40|$|Six milking cows were inoculated with bovine {{and human}} T-mycoplasmas and control {{materials}} into the udder via the <b>teat</b> <b>canal.</b> Control materials produced {{only a slight}} transient cell response in the milk. Bovine T-mycoplasmas produced clinical mastitis in {{nine out of ten}} quarters inoculated. Seven developed clinical mastitis together with visible changes in the milk, excretion of T-mycoplasmas and greatly increased cell counts in the milk. In three of these quarters, in two different cows, milk secretion ceased completely. Two quarters in a different cow showed visible milk changes, excretion of T-mycoplasmas and increased cell counts. Two quarters were inoculated with human T-mycoplasmas and neither produced any signs of mastitis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a Lactococcus lactis strain was tested {{for its ability}} of growth {{inhibition}} of Staphylococcus aureus in-vitro, using a cocultivation method. Furthermore, the strain was used in a field trial as probiotic teat dip for dairy cows. For the cocultivataion, a Lactococcus lactis strain and a Staphylococcus aureus strain were incubated in microtitre plates in different concentrations and their growth was observed by turbidity measurement. To evaluate the potential impact on bacterial growth, DNA was extracted from all incubates and the strains were quantified with qPCR. A minor inhibition of growth of S. aureus was detected when cocultivation was performed with the highest used concentration of L. lactis and the lowest used concentration of S. aureus. No other concentration led to the implication of a mutual impact of the strains. During the field trial over the period of four months, a control group of 35 dairy cows was dipped with a teat dip based on iodine and an experimental group of 37 animals was treated with a teat dip based on Lactococcus lactis. Data of clinical parameters were collected to evaluate {{the impact of the}} application of the teat dips on the teat skin as well as the udder health. Furthermore, the colonization of the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> by the applied Lactococcus lactis strain was evaluated, using microbiological and molecular biological methods after taking swab samples. The evaluation of clinical parameters and selected characteristic values for udder health revealed few differences between the control and the experimental group. Accordingly, the application of the teat dip containing Lactococcus lactis can be classified as comparable to the teat dip used in the control group, containing iodine. The commercially available PathoProof™ Mastitis PCR Assay was quantified with extracts of culture strains, which lead to some false-positive results. Therefore, the samples of the experimental animals could not be tested for all mastitis causing pathogens detectable with the test kit and a possible variation of the microflora of the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> could not be evaluated. The establishment of the used Lactococcus lactis strain in the <b>teat</b> <b>canal</b> of dairy cows could be shown by microbiological as well as molecular biological methods. With regard to the present results, the use of a probiotic teat dip seems to be comparable to conventional teat dips. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of the probiotic teat dip under different conditions, including animal housing, hygiene and genetics...|$|E

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) {{mastitis}} {{is extremely}} difficult to control by treatment alone. To date, successful control is gained only through prevention of new infections and culling of infected animals. S. aureus organisms colonize teat ends and/or teat lesions.
