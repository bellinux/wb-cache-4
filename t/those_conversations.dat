Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in the}} player being given a series of pre-determined questions or responses. Conversation options and the outcome of <b>those</b> <b>conversations</b> change according to the player's previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player's leadership skill. The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, making it impossible to sell further items.|$|E

Reporter Julio Algañaraz {{wrote that}} Carfagna and Silvio Berlusconi {{engaged in a}} telephone conversation with explicit allusions to oral sex. The wiretap transcripts have not been published, but the Italian newspaper La Repubblica interviewed the former vice-minister of Foreign Affairs in the Berlusconi II Cabinet and socialist executive Margherita Boniver, who admitted the existence of some messages. She later apologized to Mara Carfagna and the case was closed. Carfagna has instead sued for libel newspapers which had mentioned the alleged conversations and had shown some offensive statements. Following the reports, October 9, 2012 the Civil Court of Rome condemned Sabina Guzzanti to compensation of 40,000 euro to the former minister, ensuring, as all authorities, that <b>those</b> <b>conversations</b> never existed.|$|E

His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regard this proposal as a contribution of the greatest importance to the cause of future naval limitation. They further believe that the agreement which they have now reached with the German government, and which they regard as a permanent and definite agreement as from to-day between the two Governments, will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on the subject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers of the world.|$|E
25|$|Travel 2.0 refers a {{model of}} Web 2.0 on tourism {{industries}} which provided virtual travel communities. Travel 2.0 model allow user {{to create their own}} contents and exchange their words through globally interactive features on websites. The users also can contribute their experiences, images and suggestions regarding their trips on online travel communities. For example, TripAdvisor is an online travel community which enables user to rate and share autonomously their reviews and feedbacks on hotels and tourist destinations. Non pre-associate users can interact socially and discuss through discussion forums on Tripadvior. Social media, especially Travel 2.0 website, plays a crucial role in decision-making behaviours of travellers. The user-generated contents on social media tools {{have a significant impact on}} travellers’ choices and organisation preferences. The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in receiving information methods of travellers from business-to-customer marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting. The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier. In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks and uncertainties before purchasing stages. Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative feedbacks which can damage images of organisations and destinations. For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative feedbacks would be refrained by half of customers. Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative feedbacks on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor <b>those</b> <b>conversations</b> and participate in communities to enhance a customer loyalty and maintain customer relationships.|$|E

They're all their own stories {{and they all have}} their own drive, but it's sort of {{building}} toward a big thing {{at the end of the}} eight episodes." [...] Elaborating on this, Atwell said, [...] "it's incredibly tight, the script, which is great. It's fast moving and fast paced but luckily because it's not stretched out of 22 episodes, nothing is diluted. Every line is vital to not only moving the story and the action [...] but also developing the characters." [...] The season's overarching storyline revolves around the chemical weapon Midnight Oil, which is based on the Madbomb of the Captain America comics. The Madbomb was originally considered for use in , before negotiations with actors to adapt the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline were completed. Also in July, it was revealed that Carter's husband would be explored in the series.

He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, <b>those</b> <b>conversations</b> were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E
