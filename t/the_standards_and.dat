5|$|<b>The</b> <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> balusters of {{the stairs}} {{on the north side}} of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and {{probably}} date to the mid-17th century, although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century.

5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced {{to ensure that it}} did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>and</b> Practices liaison for approval.|$|E

During the 2014-2015 school year, ELARA's 11th grade class taking the CAASPP resulted with 11% exceeding <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 26% meeting <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 37% nearly meeting <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> <b>and</b> 26% not meeting <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> in English Language Arts/Literacy. 2% exceeded <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 7% met <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 24% nearly met <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> <b>and</b> 67% did not meet <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> in Mathematics. <b>The</b> 2015-2016 11th grade class resulted with 19% exceeding <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 49% meeting <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 25% nearly meeting <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> <b>and</b> 7% not meeting <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> in English Language Arts/Literacy. 3% exceeded <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 19% met <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> 39% nearly met <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> <b>and</b> 39% did not meet <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> in Mathematics.|$|R

5|$|The house {{alongside}} the Jewel Tower {{was taken over}} by the new department in 1869, and <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> testing equipment were installed in the tower itself, which was felt to be particularly suitable for making scientific measurements, because of its thick walls. The roof, which was in poor condition, was repaired. The ground floor was used as a weighing room and for storing glass fluid measures, the first floor held the standards of length, and the second floor was used as a museum to display old historical equipment.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as {{a small price to pay}} to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house <b>the</b> <b>standards,</b> <b>and</b> even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E
30|$|Specificity was {{performed}} to compare <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> FA <b>and</b> vanillin and extract.

Spectrum scan accelerated at 100  nm/s with split dimensions 5 [*]×[*] 0.45  mm, micro. Spectral detection for optimum wavelength was calculated in the range 200 to 700  nm.|$|R

5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E
5|$|Song Reader, {{a project}} Beck {{released}} in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, {{in the hopes}} that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of <b>the</b> <b>standards,</b> <b>and</b> became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.|$|E

25|$|Finally, most of {{the temple}} {{decoration}} {{is the work of}} local Theban artists. This is evidenced by the dominant artistic style of the temple which represents people with large lips and eyes and thin bodies. At the opposite, the refined chapels of Mentuhotep II's wives are certainly due to Memphite craftsmen who were heavily influenced by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> conventions of the Old Kingdom. This phenomenon of fragmentation of the artistic styles is observed throughout the First Intermediate Period and is a direct consequence of the political fragmentation of the country.|$|E
