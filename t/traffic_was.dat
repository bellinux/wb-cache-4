5|$|Heavy Traffic is a 1973 American adult {{animated}} comedy-drama film {{written and}} directed by Ralph Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal fantasies of a young New York cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery as a metaphor for inner-city life. Heavy <b>Traffic</b> <b>was</b> Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz's follow-up to the film Fritz the Cat. Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, Heavy <b>Traffic</b> <b>was</b> given an X rating by the MPAA.

5|$|In 1964, several {{changes were}} made to the {{business}} routes in downtown Jackson. Eastbound BL I-94 <b>traffic</b> <b>was</b> shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue, and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue. The westbound <b>traffic</b> <b>was</b> shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street, continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue. The eastern end was updated further in 1968 to use Louis Glick Highway to connect to the northern half of the loop around downtown to Michigan Avenue. A set of connector streets on the western side of the downtown loop opened in November 1969 to streamline the flow of traffic further resulting in the last changes to the BL I-94 routing in Jackson. Eastbound <b>traffic</b> <b>was</b> redirected to the connector on Michigan Avenue just east of Third Street. This connector curved south then east to Washington Avenue near First Street. Louis Glick Highway was extended west from Blackstone curving south to merge into Michigan. In 2012, the eastern terminus of the business route was shifted easterly to follow Ann Arbor and Sargent roads to exit145 on I-94; as a result, the former partial interchange between I-94 and Ann Arbor Road which formerly served as the business route's eastern terminus was obliterated.|$|E

5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the <b>traffic</b> <b>was</b> routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound <b>traffic</b> <b>was</b> routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 <b>traffic</b> <b>was</b> diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E
