5|$|Victorious, the MDETC quickly {{began the}} {{electrification}} of the DR's tracks, starting with an extension from Ealing Common to South Harrow that opened with its first electric service in June 1903. Conversion {{of the rest}} of the DR's tracks was completed in mid-1905, although failure to coordinate installations with the MR meant that the first electric services on the Inner Circle from 1 July 1905 were disrupted for several months due to equipment failures on the MR's trains. Power came from the UERL's own Lots Road Power Station on Chelsea Creek. Originally planned by the B, construction of the power station began in 1902 and finished in December 1904. It became operational on 1 February 1905, generating three-phase alternating current at 11,000 volts, which was converted to 550 volts direct current at <b>track-side</b> transformers located around the network. The power station was constructed large enough to power all of the UERL's lines once they opened plus others later. By the time the last of the DR's steam trains were retired on 5 November 1905, the UERL had spent £1.7million (£ today) on the electrification of the line.|$|E
25|$|The games' sponsor (Latin editor) usually {{sat beside}} {{the images of}} {{attending}} gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (pulvinar) but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the Republican era) the dictator Manius Valerius Maximus and his descendants were granted rights to a curule chair at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing. In the 190sBC, stone <b>track-side</b> seating was built, exclusively for senators.|$|E
500|$|The railway and its {{personnel}} were {{an active part}} of the Norwegian resistance movement during the war. In particular, Swedish newspapers and literature were smuggled into the country, primarily by stokers, who hid the material in the coal. Also, {{people who were not}} able to flee to Sweden via the mountains, or needed to get out in a hurry, were sometimes smuggled on board the trains, primarily on German trains. Illegal documents and microfilms were also smuggled out. For German transport trains, <b>track-side</b> employees tried to create [...] "delays".|$|E
500|$|The Walt Disney World Railroad {{utilizes}} block {{signals to}} notify the engineers, firemen, and conductors on each train whether the track segments along the railroad's [...] of main-line track are clear or occupied by other trains. The WDWRR's track is divided into seven such segments, or blocks, and each block has a <b>track-side</b> block signal to communicate its status. Block signals are located {{at each of the}} three stations, alongside the three main-line blocks between the stations, and alongside the spur line connecting the WDWRR's roundhouse to the main line.|$|E
500|$|Roper {{was asked}} to {{demonstrate}} his 'self propeller' at the Charles River velodrome, a banked concrete bicycle racing track, where he first paced the racing cyclists, then raced professional rider Nat Butler, easily outpacing the bicyclists with timed laps at around 30mph (120.2sec/mile on the 1/3mile track). He was then encouraged to give a demonstration of maximum speed, and was timed at over 40mph, when a 'sudden pallor' was seen on his face, and his machine wobbled to a stop, Roper falling off his cycle. [...] He died at the <b>track-side</b> with his son Charles, of 'natural causes', at age 72.|$|E
500|$|Webber {{suffered}} two engine {{failures in}} {{practice for the}} , {{the first of which}} forced Webber to extinguish it himself after being unable to find a <b>track-side</b> marshal willing to help. In the race, Webber was forced to retire because of a loss of engine power. He was able to pick up two Championship points in the following race with a seventh-place finish in the [...] Webber had lined up 14th on the grid, after being handed a one-second penalty for yellow flag infringements during Friday practice, but was able to move through the field to take his points tally to 3. After the race, he was criticised by Michael Schumacher for refusing to yield when Webber had emerged from his pit stop slightly ahead of (but one lap behind) Schumacher. Upon hearing the comments, Webber said he [...] "would do exactly the same again" [...] in the same situation.|$|E
500|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to Disneyland's entrance, where a pump-style handcar {{built by the}} Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company {{can be seen on}} a siding, the trains of the Disneyland Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. The train will take around 18 minutes to complete a round trip on the main line when three trains are running, and 20 minutes when four trains are running; on any given day, between two and four trains run, with three trains running on average. An engineer accompanied by a fireman operates the locomotive, while conductors {{at each end of the}} train supervise the passengers. Prior to departing Main Street, U.S.A. Station, the engineer must confirm whether the signal light in the locomotive's cab is green, indicating that the track segment ahead is clear, or red, indicating that the track segment ahead is occupied by another train. The DRR's route is divided into eleven such segments, or blocks, and each locomotive has a block signal in its cab to communicate the status of each block. Prior to the installation of cab signalling in the locomotives around 2005, the status of each block along the railroad's [...] of main-line track was displayed by <b>track-side</b> block signals, of which only the ones at the four stations remain.|$|E
2500|$|The typical control {{algorithm}} places vehicles in imaginary moving [...] "slots" [...] that {{go around the}} loops of track. Real vehicles are allocated a slot by <b>track-side</b> controllers. Traffic jams are prevented by placing north/south vehicles in even slots, and east/west vehicles in odd slots. At intersections, the traffic in these systems can interpenetrate without slowing.|$|E
2500|$|It {{generally}} {{consists of}} at least one <b>track-side</b> platform and a station building (depot) providing such ancillary services as ticket sales and waiting rooms. If a station is on a single-track line, it often has a passing loop to facilitate traffic movements. The smallest stations are most often referred to as [...] "stops" [...] or, {{in some parts of the}} world, as [...] "halts" [...] (flag stops).|$|E

It is on the railway line between Birmingham and Gloucester (...) [...] [...] The Lickey Incline is the steepest sustained adhesion-worked gradient on a British standard gauge railway. It climbs into Birmingham from the south over the Bunter geological formation (one or two exposures are visible from the <b>track-side),</b> and passes about [...] away from the Lickey Hills, a well-known local beauty spot.|$|E
2500|$|Other special {{services}} include occasional [...] "double header" [...] steam trains, and dinner trains originating in Port Augusta and {{stopping at the}} <b>track-side</b> Willows Brewery Restaurant en route to Quorn. A new service introduced in 2010 saw guests dining on the train in a first class dining carriage, with a 3-course meal prepared in the carriage's kitchen by a local hotel's chef. Trains and carriages are also available for private hire, suiting a range of different occasions from weddings to tour groups.|$|E
2500|$|Recently Imperial College London and the {{environmental}} charity [...] have announced the Renewable Traction Power project to investigate using <b>track-side</b> solar panels to power trains [...] Meanwhile, Indian railways announced their intention to use on board PV to run air conditioning systems in railway coaches.. Also, Indian Railways announced it is to conduct a trial run {{by the end of}} May 2016. It hopes that an average of 90,800 liters of diesel per train will be saved on an annual basis, which in turn results in reduction of 239 tones of CO2.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} most RPO cars was a hook {{that could be}} used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a <b>track-side</b> mail crane at smaller towns where the train did not stop. [...] The first US patent for such a device (...) was awarded to L.F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867. With the train often operating at 70mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station. [...] In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging mail pouch while the clerk stood in the open doorway. [...] As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound mail pouch out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train. [...] An employee of the local post office would retrieve the pouch and deliver it to the post office.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{standard}} tests, as technically a new design of locomotive, Tornado {{was required to}} undergo specific extra tests to examine ride quality and track force, to assess the effect the locomotive {{would have on the}} main line track. The details of these tests are laid down by the Network Rail Safety Review Panel. It was agreed in advance between the trust and the authorities that these could be done in part at the GCR. Accordingly, on 25 September 2008, the tests were performed by running Tornado through the Kinchley Curve at speeds of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and , with a trailing saloon car fitted with monitoring equipment, including a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit to measure the precise speed and distance travelled every metre. Measurements were taken on board by 21 sensors attached to the locomotive, measuring pitch and roll, and acceleration and deceleration. Measurements were also taken through the use of <b>track-side</b> sensors measuring side forces exerted on the track, augmented with freeze-frame footage of the position of the wheels as they passed. The results were compared with control readings taken at the same site using Oliver Cromwell, two weeks later. The preliminary results were described as producing [...] "no untoward signals".|$|E
60|$|So {{time went}} by, {{until one day}} Keawe went upon a visit as far as Kailua to certain of his friends. There he was well feasted; and left {{as soon as he}} could the next morning, and rode hard, for he was {{impatient}} to behold his beautiful house; and, besides, the night then coming on was the night in which the dead of old days go abroad in the sides of Kona; and having already meddled with the devil, he was the more chary of meeting with the dead. A little beyond Honaunau, looking far ahead, he was aware of a woman bathing in the edge of the sea; and she seemed a well-grown girl, but he thought no more of it. Then he saw her white shift flutter as she put it on, and then her red holoku; {{and by the time he}} came abreast of her she was done with her toilet, and had come up from the sea, and stood by the <b>track-side</b> in her red holoku, and she was all freshened with the bath, and her eyes shone and were kind. Now Keawe no sooner beheld her than he drew rein.|$|E
60|$|And {{now they}} were in the last two hundred yards, Jim by this time some thirty yards ahead, but in great straits. Drake had quickened his pace, and gained slowly on him. As they rounded the corner and came into the straight, the cheers were redoubled. It was a great race. Then, fifty yards from the tape, Drake began his final sprint. If he had saved himself before, he made up for it now. The gap dwindled and dwindled. Neither could improve his pace. It was a {{question}} whether there was enough of the race left for Drake to catch his man, or whether he had once more left his sprint till too late. Jim could hear the roars of the spectators, and the frenzied appeals of Merevale's House to him to sprint, but he was already doing his utmost. Everything seemed black to him, a black, surging mist, and in its centre a thin white line, the tape. Could he reach it before Drake? Or would he collapse before he reached it? There were only five more yards to go now, and still he led. Four. Three. Two. Then something white swept past him on the right, the white line quivered, snapped, and vanished, and he pitched blindly forward on to the turf at the <b>track-side.</b> Drake had won by a foot.|$|E
