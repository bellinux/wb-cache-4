5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>for</b> coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E
