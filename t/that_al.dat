5|$|During the 2008 election, New York state {{officials}} asserted <b>that</b> <b>Al</b> Franken Inc. {{had failed to}} carry required workers' compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005. Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E
40|$|The Wingless (Wg/Wnt) {{signaling}} pathway is essential for metazoan development, where it is central to tissue growth and cellular differentiation. Deregulated Wg pathway activation underlies severe developmental abnormalities, as well as carcinogenesis. Armadillo/b-Catenin {{plays a key role}} in the Wg transduction cascade; its cytoplasmic and nuclear levels directly determine the output activity of Wg signaling and are thus tightly controlled. In all current models, once Arm is targeted for degradation by the Arm/b-Catenin destruction complex, its fate is viewed as set. We identified a novel Wg/Wnt pathway component, Armless (Als), which is required for Wg target gene expression in a cell-autonomous manner. We found by genetic and biochemical analyses <b>that</b> <b>Als</b> functions downstream of the destruction complex, at the level of the SCF/Slimb/bTRCP E 3 Ub ligase. In the absence of Als, Arm levels are severely reduced. We show by biochemical and in vivo studies <b>that</b> <b>Als</b> interacts directly with Ter 94, an AAA ATPase known to associate with E 3 ligases and to drive protein turnover. We suggest <b>that</b> <b>Als</b> antagonizes Ter 94 ’s positive effect on E 3 ligase function and propose <b>that</b> <b>Als</b> promotes Wg signaling by rescuing Arm from proteolytic degradation, spotlighting an unexpected step where the Wg pathway signal is modulated...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} obtain support from the Imperial Japanese Army for the Midway operation, the Imperial Japanese Navy agreed to support their {{invasion}} of the Aleutian Islands. The IJA wished to occupy the western Aleutians to place the Japanese home islands {{out of range of}} U.S. land-based bombers based in Alaska. The Japanese operations in the Aleutian Islands (Operation AL) removed yet more ships that could otherwise have augmented the force striking Midway. Whereas many earlier historical accounts considered the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces away, early twenty-first century research has suggested <b>that</b> <b>AL</b> was intended to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway. A one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before the Midway attack.|$|E

40|$|A murine {{model of}} disseminated {{candidiasis}} was utilized {{to determine whether}} Candida albicans Als proteins are produced in vivo. The kidneys, spleen, heart, liver, and lungs were collected from mice inoculated with one of three C. albicans strains (SC 5314, B 311, or WO- 1). Immunohistochemical analysis of murine tissues by using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Als serum indicated <b>that</b> <b>Als</b> proteins were produced by each C. albicans cell in the tissues examined. Patterns of staining with the anti-Als serum were similar among the C. albicans strains tested. These data indicated <b>that</b> <b>Als</b> protein production was widespread in disseminated candidiasis and that, despite strain differences in ALS gene expression previously noted in vitro, Als protein production in vivo was similar among C. albicans strains. The extensive production of Als proteins in vivo and their presence on the C. albicans cell wall position these proteins well for a role in host-pathogen interaction...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{generally}} acceptable {{definition and}} a severity grading system for anastomotic leakages (ALs) following rectal resection {{were not available}} until 2010, when the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer (ISGRC) proposed a definition and a grading system for AL. Methods: A search for published data was performed using the MEDLINE database (2000 to December 5, 2012) to perform a systematic review of the studies <b>that</b> described <b>AL,</b> grade AL according to the grading system, pool data, and determine the average rate of AL for each grade after anterior resection (AR) for rectal cancer. Results: A total of 930 abstracts were retrieved; 40 articles on AR, 25 articles on low AR (LAR), and 5 articles on ultralow AR (ULAR) {{were included in the}} review and analysis. The pooled overall AL rate of AR was 8. 58 % (2, 085 / 24, 288); the rate of the asymptomatic leakage (Grade A) was 2. 57 %, <b>that</b> of <b>AL</b> <b>that</b> required active intervention without relaparotomy (Grade B) was 2. 37 %, and <b>that</b> of <b>AL</b> <b>that</b> required relaparotomy (Grade C) was 5. 40 %. The pooled rate of <b>AL</b> <b>that</b> required relaparotomy was higher in AR (5. 40 %) than in LAR (4. 70 %) and in ULAR (1. 81 %), which could be attributed to the higher rate of protective defunctioning stoma in LAR (40. 72 %) and ULAR (63. 44 %) compared with that in AR (30. 11 %).
