Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E

Leslie also wants to see, but Charlie is uncomfortable with the idea. <b>To</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> Charlie asks about their children. Sarah and Leslie have produced seven thousand eggs. Leslie is appalled when he learns that the humans do not lay eggs. Nancy explains human gestation and that they have three children.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{break-up}} {{was announced}} shortly before Live 'n' Kickins release in early 1974, and Bruce released his fourth solo album Out of the Storm later that year. Also in 1974 he {{featured on the}} title track of Frank Zappa's album Apostrophe ('), recorded in November 1972. Bruce was credited with bass and co-authorship on the improvised track. When asked about Zappa in a 1992 interview, Bruce tried <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and jokingly insisted that he had played only cello parts. Outtakes from the session were released on the archival release The Crux Of The Biscuit in 2016. In 1973 Bruce recorded bass guitar for Lou Reed's Berlin album, playing on all but two tracks.|$|E

50|$|Evolutionary {{economics}} {{does not}} take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed.

It is naturalistic in purging earlier notions of economic change as teleological or necessarily improving the human condition.|$|R

40|$|In view of {{the unrest}} shared by the proponents of this {{research}} regarding the human ‘doing’ as therapeutic action {{in the process of}} Occupational Therapy, we proposed to discuss the therapeutic value of this action according to the different concepts developed on <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> To this end, we carried out an exploratory literature survey, within the study strategy of the Laboratory for Research on Occupational Therapy (LETO), which was adopted in the fifth year of the Occupational Therapy course of the University of the State of Pará. After learning different ideas of activity and occupation developed by authors of Occupational Therapy, analyzing the therapeutic process and the meaning of human action within this process, we verified that the different conceptions of the therapeutic value of intervention are related to historical moments, areas of expertise, and professional training.

[...] Finally cornered, he admits that the room belongs to both of them, but he says that he will have his little back second floor room ready later the same day. Both lodgers say they will take it, which Bouncer quickly points out makes no sense whatsoever. He leaves them to decide which will vacate the current room. Each suggests the other should leave, but neither will budge. Finally, they realise that it is all Bouncer's fault, and they may as well be friends. They serenade each other on the guitar.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the band {{recorded}} White Light/White Heat, Nico had quit and Warhol had been fired, both against Cale's wishes. Warhol's replacement as manager was Steve Sesnick. In September 1968, Cale left the band at Reed's behest. Morrison and Tucker were discomfited by Reed's tactics but continued with the group. Cale's replacement was Boston-based musician Doug Yule, who played bass, keyboards and who would soon share lead vocal duties in the band with Reed. The group now took on a more pop-oriented sound and acted more {{as a vehicle for}} Reed to develop his songwriting craft. The group released two albums with this lineup: 1969's The Velvet Underground and 1970's Loaded. The latter included two of the group's most commercially successful songs, [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] and [...] "Sweet Jane". After the band's move to Atlantic Records' Cotillion label, their new manager pushed Reed <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter of his songs to lighter topics in hopes of commercial success. Loaded had taken more time to record than the previous three albums together, but had not broken them through to a wider audience.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} written from a Lacanian {{perspective}} and considers Lacan's development of {{his theory of}} ethics from its origins in Freud's exploration of psychic inscriptions to a notion of ethics oriented to the Real of the unconscious, the Real that is not symbolizable. The aim of analysis is <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> enjoys his symptom, a <b>change</b> from suffering <b>to</b> a satisfaction that comes from having a choice. Using the conceptual tools of Lacanian psychoanalysis which differentiate between Imaginary (the image and its lures), the Symbolic (the signifier {{and the structure of}} language) and the Real (enjoyment in the body that language does not reach), the argument moves beyond an idea of truth attached to meaning. That is the truth that the analyst's interpretation might produce; its beyond is a notion of truth grounded in the enjoyment of the symptom outside meaning, a truth that will allow for an ethics of psychoanalysis that is oriented towards the Real of jouissance by the compass of affect...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of abstract schemas and productive rules in language {{is affected by}} both token and type frequencies. High token frequencies and surface similarities help to discover formal and functional commonalities between utterances and categorize them as instances of the same schema. High type frequencies and diversity help to develop slots in these schemas, which allow the production and comprehension of novel utterances. In the current study we looked at both token and type frequencies in two related constructions in German child-directed speech: simple transitive and complement-clause constructions. Both constructions contain high frequency verbs, which potentially support the {{development of}} verb-specific schemas. However only the frequent verbs in the transitive constructions occur {{with a variety of}} subject types, which also supports the development of a slot in <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> position. We then used an elicited production task to compare 4 - and 5 -year-old German-speaking children's productivity with simple transitive constructions and complement-clause constructions. The children were prompted <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of high and low frequency simple transitive verbs, such as essen 'eat' and naschen 'nibble', mental-state complement-taking verbs, such as denken 'think' and vermuten 'presume', and communication complement-taking verbs, such as sagen 'say' and berichten 'report'. In accordance with earlier findings, children had less difficulty producing new utterances with high frequency transitive verbs than with low frequency transitive verbs. For the other verb classes, however we found either reverse frequency effects or no frequency effects. For these verb classes, children's productivity can be determined by diversity rather than simple token frequency. We discuss how token frequency interacts with diversity, discourse function, semantic complexity, and syntactic complexit...|$|R

Spooner shows great {{interest}} in seeing Hirst's photo album, but both Briggs and Foster discourage this. All four are now drinking champagne, and Foster, for his own pride and dignity's sake, abruptly asserts that he desired to work in this house of his own choice, where he feels privileged to serve as famous a writer as Hirst. Suddenly, Spooner asks desperately that Hirst consider hiring him as well, verbosely praising his own work ethic and other virtues. After all this, Hirst merely replies [...] "Let's change the subject for the last time", and after a pause worriedly asks [...] "What have I said?" [...] Foster explains definitively that Hirst's statement means that he (Hirst) {{will never be able}} <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> ever again. Hirst thinks back to his youth, when he mistakenly thought he saw a drowned body in a lake. Spooner now comments, [...] "No. You are in no man's land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but which remains forever, icy and silent." [...] Hirst responds [...] "I'll drink to that!"
