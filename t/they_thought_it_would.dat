5|$|Cyan {{proposed}} Myst to Sunsoft for $265,000—more {{than double}} what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cost {{to develop the}} game, but ultimately less than Myst cost to produce. After getting the go-ahead, Cyan play tested the entire game in a role-played Dungeons and Dragons form to identify any large issues before entering full production.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{families}} targeted in the Kandahar shootings {{had returned to the}} area in 2011 after previously being displaced by the surge. Fearing the Taliban but encouraged by the U.S. government, the Army, and the Afghan government, they settled near the U.S. military base because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> to be a safe place to live.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{initially}} {{imagined that}} the film would center around a clone of the character Newt from Aliens, as the Ellen Ripley character had died {{at the end of}} Alien 3. Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on a clone of Ripley, whom they saw as the anchor of the series. Whedon had to rewrite the script {{in a way that would}} bring back the Ripley character, a task he found difficult. The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien Resurrection, as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> ruin the franchise.|$|E

60|$|The Merry Little Breezes were disappointed. Their faces fell. <b>They</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be such fun {{to carry}} the news through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows, and now the very first one they met knew all about it.|$|R
5|$|Plans {{were made}} in 1993 to build a direct {{interchange}} between the turnpike and I-79 in Cranberry Township, Butler County. A contract was awarded to build this interchange in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed upon a design for the interchange. The project also included the movement {{the western end of}} the ticket system to a new toll plaza in Warrendale. The interchange project was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who wanted to prevent construction of the toll plaza as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cause noise, air and light pollution. Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow the toll plaza be built. Groundbreaking for the new interchange took place on February 22, 2002. The westbound Butler service plaza was closed because the Warrendale toll plaza was to be located at its site. On June 1, 2003, the plaza opened and the Gateway toll plaza became a flat-rate toll plaza, while all the exit toll plazas west of Warrendale closed. The direct interchange between the turnpike and I-79, connecting to US 19, opened on November 12, 2003. The project cost $44 million.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> never come.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens' {{dominance}} in the late 1970s was {{due in part to}} the presence of the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) (which had begun play in 1972) — the Canadiens were far more successful compared to other NHL teams in resisting WHA efforts to lure away top talent. The Canadiens played a central role in the 1979 merger with the WHA, which added the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets to the NHL. After years of talks, a merger agreement was reached between the two leagues, but the NHL's governors rejected the deal by one vote. Most of the NHL's American teams were in favour of the merger in part because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help them challenge Montreal's dominance, whereas against the deal were the Canadiens, who, along with the Vancouver Canucks and Toronto Maple Leafs, opposed splitting Hockey Night in Canada television revenues six ways instead of three. Upon hearing the result of the vote, fans in Edmonton, Quebec and Winnipeg launched a massive boycott of products sold by Molson, owners of the Canadiens since 1978. The boycott, along with pressure from the Canadian House of Commons, led Montreal and Vancouver to reverse their positions when a re-vote was held on March 22, 1979, allowing the merger to pass.|$|E
25|$|Some state {{officials}} and Arkansas residents {{objected to the}} creation of the theme park because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> encourage negative hillbilly stereotypes. Lou Oberste of the Publicity and Parks Commission expressed reservations, and Commission Director Bob Evans agreed that Arkansas had difficulty shedding a similar image created by comedic actor Bob Burns.|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for {{characters}} with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle {{was one of the}} harder elements to implement—it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen. The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.|$|E

In response to 26/11, many New Year's Eve concerts for 2009 were cancelled, but Patel and Country Club India decided to go ahead with their show because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be against the terrorists' will.|$|E
50|$|This was {{significantly}} different from all other romanization schemes in that, from the very outset, it was intended that the Latinxua Sin Wenz system, once established, would supersede the Chinese characters.

Unlike Gwoyeu Romatzyh, with its complex method of indicating tones, Latinxua Sin Wenz system does not indicate tones at all.|$|R
50|$|In {{collaboration}} with Sukhanov, Gannushkin has published six research papers. They preferred to study particular mental disorders taken by themselves {{rather than their}} mixed types, because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> contribute {{to the study of}} acknowledged diseases, discovery of new mental disorders, and development of psychiatric classification. Sukhanov and Gannushkin distinguished an especial form of obsessions and were the first to show the process when, at least in some cases, obsessions were transforming into schizophrenia.|$|R
50|$|When Kuntz was in school, drummer Andreas Lill heard Kuntz {{singing in}} his punk band, Rock Zock. Kuntz didn't {{like the kind}} of music that Rock Zock was playing, and Lill asked him to sing for his band, which was called Exodus at the time. When the {{question}} of a new name came up, they were inspired by a car maker they saw (Vanden Plas), and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be an interesting band name.|$|R
25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E
25|$|Kon Ichikawa {{stated in}} a Criterion Collection {{interview}} that he had witnessed {{the destruction of the}} atom bomb first hand, and had felt since then that he had to speak out against the horrors of war, despite the many comedies that made up most of his early career. Fires on the Plain got greenlighted by the studio Daiei, because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be an action movie. Ichikawa decided that it was a film that needed to be made in black and white, specifically requesting Eastman's black and white. The studio initially balked, but after a month of arguing, the studio agreed to Ichikawa's request. Ichikawa also said that he had wanted actor Eiji Funakoshi to be in the film from the beginning. Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, penned the script which got the approval of novel author Shohei Ooka.|$|E
500|$|Writer David Twohy {{approached}} Paramount Pictures with {{an original}} screenplay entitled The Wrecking Crew, {{and though the}} studio reportedly liked the idea, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> work better as a sequel to The Italian Job. [...] Gray was slated to return as director, as well as most, if not all, of the original cast. At least two drafts of the script had been written by August 2007, but the project had not been greenlit.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{episodes of}} the series {{featured}} political banter between the conservative Stan and liberal Hayley. However, the creators learned quickly that this had only [...] "a limited shelf life" [...] and did not provide {{them as much as}} <b>they</b> originally <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would.</b> Said co-creator Matt Weitzman, [...] "There are times when we still have that kind of dynamic between them, but not nearly what it was in the first season. And I think the show, honestly, has grown and benefited from <b>it,</b> because that <b>would</b> have gotten boring after a while." ...|$|R

The leap from there was that cure from The Last Stand didn't work exactly the way <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would,</b> and so we just leaped forward however many years, and he's got his powers back." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover {{art is a}} {{reversal}} of society's hierarchical structure based on social stratification. Although it was introduced to Enter Shikari as a set design for their live shows, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a [...] "solid symbol" [...] for the album. Guitarist Rory Clewlow described the cover art: [...] "Our society is often depicted as a pyramid, with the few at the top with all the wealth and the masses at the bottom with no wealth, but supporting the pyramid for the few at the top. Our upside down triangle represents this system being flipped on [...] head." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart {{commonly}} appears nude in the show, {{although in}} every case only his buttocks are visible. In The Simpsons Movie (2007), Bart appears in a sequence where he is skateboarding while fully nude; several different items cover his genitalia, but {{for a brief moment}} his penis can be seen. The scene {{was one of the first}} worked on for the film, but the producers were nervous about the segment because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> earn the movie an R rating. Despite this, the film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for [...] "Irreverent Humor Throughout." [...] The scene was later included by Entertainment Weekly in their list of [...] "30 Unforgettable Nude Scenes." ...|$|E
2500|$|When it {{was time}} to choose the first single from the album The Final Countdown, Tempest {{suggested}} the song [...] "The Final Countdown".

[...] "The Final Countdown" [...] was written to be an opening song for concerts, and <b>they</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a hit. When their record company Epic Records suggested, however, that it should be the first single, the band decided to release it.|$|R

5000|$|Lagerberg came up {{with the}} opening line [...] "I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road" [...] after {{thinking}} about his childhood home in Maine, which had a long gravel driveway. Sligh then decided to take the line and make it into a song where [...] "something's coming, and it's not good." [...] The opening piano melody came from a melody that Sligh played when Lagerberg was checking on Sligh's daughter, and decided to use <b>it</b> because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> capture the listener's attention.|$|R
500|$|... "Homer's Enemy" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{directed}} by Jim Reardon and executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. One {{of the goals of}} Oakley and Weinstein was to create several episodes in each season which would [...] "push the envelope conceptually." [...] The idea for the episode was first conceived by Bill Oakley who thought that Homer should have an enemy. The thought evolved into the concept of a [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have funnier results. The result was the character of Grimes, a man who had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} one of the most {{expensive}} in the series at the time, with two visual effects milestones for the series. During one of the sequences, the visual effects team switched from stock explosions on 2D to 3D versions. The producers wished to exceed the minute-long Horizon sequence in the previous episode. The scene where the doors close while the shield is collapsing was merely stock footage from [...] "Hot Zone", with the CGI of the shield added on. When the producers conceived the idea for the space jump between Sheppard and Zelenka, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "cool", as well as thinking that they were possibly too apprehensive. [...] However, the sequence was pulled off, and Paul Mullie described the jump as [...] "one of the best visual effects we have ever done." [...] The scene were one team dies from the collapsing shield however, was not performed as well as the producers hoped.|$|E
500|$|David Crane and Marta Kauffman began {{developing}} {{three new}} television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom Family Album was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about [...] "six {{people in their}} 20s making their way in Manhattan" [...] to NBC, since <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> fit best there. Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about {{the time when they}} had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking {{at a time when the}} future was [...] "more of a question mark." [...] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed [...] "everybody knows that feeling", and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time. The team titled the series Insomnia Cafe, and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.|$|E

This is what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> really be like.' And that's how he got the inspiration for starting his best known series, the Guardian of the Flame, in which a group of college-aged gamers are transported to the world of their game and they didn't like it as much as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>would...</b> <b>It</b> was basically a million-word love letter to the industrial revolution." ...|$|R
