40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and most devastating complications of diabetes. During the course of diabetic retinopathy, the glomeruli are slowly destroyed, usually with no detectable signs until the later stages of the disease, when the kidneys filtration process can no longer function. Throughout this disease, blood flow through the kidneys increases "hyperfiltration", and the kidneys become enlarged. Damage to the glomeruli becomes evident, as well as a condition known "microalbuminuria", in which a blood protein, albumin, leaks into the urine. This loss of proteins and other nutrients in the blood progresses, as does the damage to the glomeruli. The kidneys progressively lose their ability to filter waste until the final stage, kidney failure, occurs. On the other hand, some species of the plants were reported having remarkable medical importance. <b>Trifolium</b> <b>alexandrinum</b> is a medicinal herb; it has been shown to improve the flow of blood through arteries and veins in diabetic patients. Therefore, the present study aims to determine the possible improvement effects of different extracts of <b>Trifolium</b> <b>alexandrinum</b> (CF) on some biochemical and histopathological changes in the kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Sixty adult male albino rats (210 ± 5 g) were injected (IP) with streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg b. wt) for induction of diabetes. Animals were classified into five groups. Daily intake of water, hexane and ethanolic extracts of T. alexandrinum in drinking water for 4 weeks after diabetes induction were used. Urine glucose was detected every week. Serum total protein, albumen, urea, uric acid and creatinine levels were tested. Data were expressed statistical to elucidate the differences between treated and control groups. The kidney paraffin sections of control and treated groups were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological studies. A single dose of STZ induced diabetes produced remarkable effects on both structure and function of the rat kidneys. The kidney exhibited damage of some renal corpuscles revealed glomerular mesangial cells hypertrophy, dilatation of renal tubules together with necrosis of their lining cells. Serum total protein, albumen, urea, uric acid and creatinine were significantly increased. Daily urine volume and consequently renal excretion of albumen, urea, uric acid and creatinine were significantly increased. However, remarkable improvement of the renal structure and function of diabetic rats was observed after treating with <b>Trifolium</b> <b>alexandrinum</b> extracts especially the group treated with water extract. Conclusion: Extracts of <b>Trifolium</b> <b>alexandrinum</b> improved histological and biochemical alterations of the kidneys noticed in STZ-diabetic rats.

The studied soils were alkaline, sandy in texture and low in soil organic matter. Among the studied heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Cd, Co and Pb) in soil and Berseem, Cr content in Berseem was found to be above maximum permissible limits. Soil to Berseem metal bioaccmulation factor (BAF) was above 1 for Cr, Cu, Cd and Co in many samples and highest BAF was found for Co (4.625).

So, the present study aims to investigate and relate Paederus fuscipes assemblages to cultivated soils and forest parameters of the Punjab, Pakistan during 2008 - 2009 with six different collecting methods (pitfall traps, light traps, flight intercept traps, Berlese funnel traps, sweep net and visual observation). Maximum population was collected {{with the help of}} pitfall trap. It was recorded only from cropped areas mainly having decayed organic matter. Not a single individual was recorded from forest areas. It was mainly recorded from maize (Zea maize) and berseem (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>alexandrinum)</b> crops due to presence of soft bodied insects. It preferred damp soil rich in organic matter for egg laying under natural conditions. Maximum activity was observed near the ground. Maximum population was recorded during March and July-August. Light had attractive effect on it, so maximum activity was observed during night also. Its activity is greatly influenced by light and soil moisture contents...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInvestigation was {{performed}} to assess the effect of different sewage water treatments on the metal status of different fodder species consumed by ruminants under semi-arid conditions. Five samples each of six fodder species viz., <b>Trifolium</b> <b>alexandrinum,</b> Cichorium intybus, Avena sativa, Medicago polymorpha, Brassica campestris and Medicago sativa were collected from three fields irrigated with canal water, mix water (canal water and sewage water) and sewage water, respectively. Fodder samples were analyzed to determine the Mg, Co and Zn concentrations in shoots. Higher values of these metals were found in fodder species irrigated with sewage water relatively. Mg and Zn concentrations in all the fodder species {{were found to be}} below the critical level among all treatments. Whereas, concentrations of Co in the different fodder species were significantly different (p< 0. 05) and above the critical level. Consequently, ruminants feeding on these fodder species need continued mineral supplementation of Zn and Mg elements to prevent diseases caused by the deficiency of these elements, and to support optimum animal productivity...|$|R
40|$|Annual sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus) {{has been}} {{reported}} to produce allelopathic effects. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to estimate the allelopathic potential of both plant residue and root exudates of S. oleraceus on flavonoid composition and nodulation in a leguminous crop, <b>Trifolium</b> <b>alexandrinum,</b> and in two leguminous weeds, Melilotus indicus and T. resupinatum. The results of high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) showed that all three legumes contained six flavonoid aglycones: apigenin, daidzein, kaempferol, luteolin, myricetin and quercetin; and seven flavonoid glycosides: daidzin, genistin, hesperidin, hyperoside, kaempferol- 7 -O-glucoside, naringin and rutin. In general, both plant residue and root exudates had inhibitory effects on the flavonoid composition and nodulation of the target species. However, residue of S. oleraceus caused a significant increase in both individual and total detected flavonoids in T. alexandrinum. The results suggest that the phytotoxins released from S. oleraceus may restrain the biosynthesis of flavonoids in the target species, whereas the accumulated flavonoids in T. alexandrinum are allelopathic-induced metabolites and suggest a resistance mode in this crop...|$|R
