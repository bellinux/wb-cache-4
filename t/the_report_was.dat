5|$|Fisher {{passed this}} report on to Hughes and to Defence Minister George Pearce, {{ultimately}} {{leading to the}} evacuation of the Australian troops in December 1915. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> also used by the Dardanelles Commission on which Fisher served, while High Commissioner in London.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Australian {{government}} {{received a}} consultant's report that examined Muckaty Station {{as one of}} four possible sites for a nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> released in 2010. In February 2012, the Muckaty Station site {{was the only one}} under consideration by the government.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> {{written and}} re-written several times. Wetzler {{wrote the first}} part, Vrba the third, and the two wrote the second part together. They then worked on the whole thing together, re-writing it six times. Neumann's aide, Oscar Krasniansky, an {{engineer}} and stenographer who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel, translated it from Slovak into German {{with the help of}} Gisela Steiner. They produced a 40-page report in German, which was completed by Thursday, 27 April 1944. Vrba wrote that <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> also translated into Hungarian. The original Slovak version was not preserved.|$|E

5|$|At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships {{stopped at}} sea, and thirty-six rowing boats towed by twelve steamers {{embarked}} {{the first six}} companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions. At 02:00 a Turkish sentry reported seeing ships moving at sea, and at 02:30 <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> sent to 9th Division's headquarters. At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards (46m) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} three ways. First, {{he claimed that}} Barreto, supposed author of <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> <b>was</b> not capable of writing it. Then {{he argued that the}} allegations were exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region.|$|E

5000|$|Srebrenica: a ‘safe’ area <b>is</b> a 2002 <b>report</b> by <b>the</b> Netherlands Institute for War Documentation (NIOD) {{concerning}} the Srebrenica Massacre. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> took {{seven years to}} finalize.

5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the charges against the clergy were so serious {{that he had to}} focus on destroying Barreto's credibility. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author of <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to California, Col. Alexander was {{appointed}} president of a board appointed by the U.S. Congress to study the potential of irrigating the San Joaquin Valley, Tulare Valley, and Sacramento Valley. The board, which {{became known as the}} Alexander Commission, conducted a survey of the California Central Valley throughout the summer and fall of 1873. The Commission's report declared that large-scale irrigation was possible and that much land could be reclaimed from the swamps around the Sacramento River. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> not initially acted upon, but was the first professional survey of the valley and set the stage for further development.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, some Georgia Tech {{faculty members}} {{belonging}} to Sigma Xi started a research club that met {{once a month}} at Tech. One of the monthly subjects, proposed by ceramic engineering professor W. Harry Vaughan, was a collection of issues related to Tech, such as library development, {{and the development of}} a state engineering station. Such a station would theoretically assist local businesses with engineering problems via Georgia Tech's established faculty and resources. This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiments at universities around the country, and <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929.|$|E

5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> based on a recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization {{to take into consideration}} the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, {{at first}} meeting in {{confidence}} {{but then in}} public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, {{the cause of the}} mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny.|$|E

5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> published.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} authorities at Bombay. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> released on 11 September 1944 {{and concluded that the}} fire and subsequent explosion on Fort Stikine was an accident. Sabotage was ruled out. The death toll was given as 231 service and port personnel killed, with 476 injured. Civilian casualties were in excess of 500 killed, with 2,408 treated in hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} <b>The</b> <b>Report</b> <b>was</b> first {{seen in a}} series of Daily Show {{segments}} which advertised the then-fictional series as a joke. It was later developed by Stewart's Busboy Productions and pitched to Comedy Central, which green-lighted the program; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful Daily Show franchise beyond a half-hour. The series opened to strong ratings, averaging 1.2million viewers nightly during its first week on the air. Comedy Central signed a long-term contract for The Colbert Report within its first month on the air, when it immediately established itself among the network's highest-rated shows.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka {{hospital}} {{due to a}} shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an immediate cause for the action, but the veracity of the incident has since been questioned. Borisav Jović, a contemporary high-ranking Serbian official {{and member of the}} Yugoslav Presidency, has claimed that <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> just wartime propaganda, stating that Banja Luka had two bottled oxygen production plants in its immediate vicinity and was virtually self-reliant in that respect.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project {{no longer was}} justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final nail in the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized {{the creation of the}} Yukon Flats National Wildlife Monument, which became the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated any possibility of flooding the Yukon Flats, a process that would have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{delay of}} {{several weeks before}} <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>was</b> {{distributed}} widely enough to gain the attention of governments.
