25|$|Two {{developments}} {{have helped to}} transform Israel's economy {{since the beginning of}} the 1990s.

500|$|On May 3, 2013, just a {{month before}} the film's premiere, {{producers}} announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life. At the time of his departure, Pacino's character had already been fully voiced and animated. Chris Renaud, co-director of the film, commented on Pacino's departure: [...] "So we don't want an unhappy actor, and we want something that is well-realized on all sides. If you don't see eye to eye, sometimes it's easier to (part company) and move on from there." [...] Benjamin Bratt, who had already been considered before Pacino, stepped in to voice Eduardo. Chris Meledandri, producer of the film, admitted that he was not [...] "aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> an actor in at such a late stage". Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. Initially, during his five-day recording, he tried to imitate Pacino's voice, but found it impossible, saying [...] "no one can out-Al Pacino Al Pacino". He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration, and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character. His work was commended by Variety, saying: [...] "You'd never guess he wasn't the filmmakers' first choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen {{for as long as}} I can remember – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though it was felt that the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E
