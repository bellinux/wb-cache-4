5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> {{application}} of 244Cm — though rather limited in total volume — is as α-particle {{source in the}} alpha particle X-ray spectrometers (APXS). These instruments were installed on the Sojourner, Mars, Mars 96, Mars Exploration Rovers and Philae comet lander, {{as well as the}} Mars Science Laboratory to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of planet Mars. APXS was also used in the Surveyor 5–7 moon probes but with a 242Cm source.|$|E
5|$|The tube station {{became one}} of the {{principal}} shelters during the Blitz. Following heavy raids on the East End on 7 September 1940, many sought refuge underground, and staff opened the gates to everyone at Liverpool Street without asking for tickets. Though technically illegal, it remained <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> and safe shelter for local residents.|$|E

Students in years K-2 get free travel regardless of where they live, students in years 3-6 get free travel if they live further than 1.6 km radial distance or 2.3 km by <b>the</b> <b>most</b> direct <b>practical</b> walking distance from the school, and high school students get free travel only if they live more than 2 km radial distance or 2.9 km by <b>the</b> <b>most</b> direct <b>practical</b> walking distance from school.|$|R
5|$|According to Callisthenes, the Persians {{were using}} water clocks in 328 {{to ensure a}} just and exact {{distribution}} of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zeebad, dates back to 500. Later they were also {{used to determine the}} exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or Yaldā – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Castelli and Álzaga plotted to oust Liniers and {{constitute}} a local government Junta, {{similar to those}} of the metropoli. This project was not shared by most of the natives or by the head of the Regiment of Patricians, Cornelio Saavedra. Manuel Belgrano proposed as an alternative to support the plans of Princess Charlotte, which were supported by Castelli and other criollos. Belgrano, who held monarchist ideas, argued that the Carlotist project would be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> means of achieving independence from Spain in the circumstances. On September 20, 1808, Castelli wrote a letter to Charlotte, with the signatures of Antonio Beruti, Hipólito Vieytes, Belgrano, and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

McDonald, {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} {{advanced}} technological development and believed that his company's products should include <b>the</b> latest, <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> advances in a well-built product that continued to enhance the company's reputation. Of the many products of Zenith Radio, the 'Trans-Oceanic' series of portable radios were amongst <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{prospective}} <b>practical</b> research direction, EAPs {{have been}} used in artificial muscles. Their ability to emulate the operation of biological muscles with high fracture toughness, large actuation strain and inherent vibration damping draw the attention of scientists in this field.|$|R
5|$|Within his Remarks, Staszic did not {{portray the}} life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, {{one of the most}} {{prominent}} statesmen in Polish history); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before. Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes. He advocated the abolition of the serfdom and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights). He criticised the szlachta (Polish nobility) for inefficient governance, and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone. He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours. Although he preferred republicanism in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe. In Remarks he even supported the introduction of an absolute monarchy in Poland.|$|E

25|$|The first method {{requires}} single perfect matches {{between the}} query and database sequences i.e. the two k-mer words {{are exactly the}} same. This approach is not considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical.</b> This is because a small k-mer size is {{necessary in order to}} achieve high levels of sensitivity, but this increases the number of false positive hits, thus increasing {{the amount of time spent}} in the alignment stage of the algorithm.|$|E
25|$|The goiter in Graves' {{disease is}} often not nodular, but thyroid nodules are also common. Differentiating common forms of {{hyperthyroidism}} such as Graves' disease, single thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter is important to determine proper treatment. The differentiation among these entities has advanced, as imaging and biochemical tests have improved. Measuring TSH-receptor antibodies with the h-TBII assay has been proven efficient and was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> approach found in one study.|$|E
25|$|Year collections: Rather {{than being}} {{satisfied}} {{with a single}} specimen of a type, a great many collectors collect type by year; for example, one Memorial Lincoln Cent for every year from 1959 (the year it was first minted) to 2008 (the {{last year it was}} minted). This is perhaps one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> ways to collect a national currency since probably the majority of coin reference books and coin albums catalogue in the same manner.|$|E
