The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) is currently in the process of mapping woody change across the State of Queensland for the era 1999 to 2001. SLATS covers such a large area that Landsat <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> (TM) <b>imagery</b> was chosen as the most effective data for this purpose.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{feasibility}} of using Landsat Thematic Mapper data for mapping muskox summer habitat was tested on northern Banks Island, Northwest Territories. Digital image enhancement and classification techniques were examined {{to determine if}} summer foraging habitats could be detected and mapped using <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> <b>imagery.</b> Interpretations of the Satellite data were verified in the field during the summers of 1988 and 1989. The most important summer foraging habitats for muskoxen included the wet sedge meadow, graminoid tundra and graminoid/dwarf shrub tundra cover types. These lowland habitats were generally distinguishable on enhanced colour images and were easily differentiated from upland areas. The most suitable colour composite for differentiating muskox summer habitats was the near-infrared (band 4), shortwave infrared (band 5) and red (band 3) spectral bands displayed in red, green and blue respectively. Upland cover types, including dwarf shrub tundra, hummocky tundra and dwarf shrub/lichen barrens, were more difficult to differentiate because of spectral variability resulting from differences in plant cover and site characteristics. The classified image had an overall accuracy of 88 %. The summer habitats of particular importance to muskoxen had classification accuracies of 8449 %. Detection of important foraging habitats on <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> <b>imagery</b> is attributable to the spectral distinctiveness of wet graminoid communities and the high spectral sensitivity and spatial resolution of the infrared sensors, which allow detection of differences in surface moisture and vegetation physiognomy.

40|$|This study {{suggests}} {{an approach to}} obtain flood extent boundaries using spatial analysis based on Landsat- 5 <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> <b>imageries</b> and the digital elevation model. The suggested approach firstly extracts the flood inundation areas using the ISODATA image-processing algorithm from four Landsat 5 TM imageries. Then, the ground elevations at the intersections of the extracted flood extent boundaries and the specified river cross sections are read from the digital elevation to estimate the elevation-discharge relationship. Lastly, the flood extent is generated based on the estimated elevation-discharge relationship. The methodology was tested over two river reaches in Indiana, United States. The estimated elevation-discharge relationship showed a good match with the correlation coefficients varying between 0. 82 and 0. 99. In addition, self-validation was also performed for the estimated spatial extent of the flood by comparing it to the waterbody extracted from the Landsat images used to develop the elevation-discharge relationship. The result indicated that the match between the estimated and the extracted flood extents was better with higher flood magnitude. We expect that the suggested methodology will help under-developed and developing countries to obtain flood maps, which have difficulties getting flood maps through traditional approaches based on computer modeling...|$|R
