25|$|The tectonic {{evolution}} of {{the area of the}} present-day Eastern Hills started with a marine back-arc basin in the Late Jurassic. The Early Cretaceous stages Berriasian and Valanginian were dominated by the presence of a marine incursion from the proto-Caribbean into the continent of South America, in those times still attached to Africa and Antarctica. The central region of current Colombia, the later Eastern Cordillera, was characterised by the deposition of calcareous shales with turbidite deposits from the Cáqueza area. During the Late Aptian to Early Albian, a marine shale-dominated sedimentation existed with more carbonate-rich deposits to the north, represented by the mosasaur fossil-bearing Paja Formation in Boyacá. The <b>Turonian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Cretaceous era experienced a worldwide anoxic event that produced highly organic shales in the area, today represented by the Chipaque Formation. The Upper Cretaceous sequence, illustrated in the stratigraphy by the Guadalupe Group, was deposited in a marine environment with alternating sandstones and shales.|$|E

40|$|The {{calcareous}} nannoplankton floras of {{sections in}} Tunisia, Southern Spain and France {{have been investigated}} leading to a succession of 17 biozones for the Middle and Upper Cretaceous, of which the Rucinolithus hayii Zone for the Middle Santonian is new. In order to correlate the zonation with the chronostratigraphic scale the calcareous nannofossil contents of the stratotypes of the commonly used European Middle and Upper Cretaceous stages have been investigated.

From the samples used for the present study the planktonic foraminifera have also been studied to obtain a first order correlation between the zonations based on calcareous nannoplankton and planktonic foraminifera. Evolutionary trends have been recognized and are described in detail in the genera Ceratolithoides, Eiffellithus and Broinsonia.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{boundary}} {{interval between}} the Cenomanian and <b>Turonian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Upper Cretaceous shows a positive xcursion in the carbon isotopic composition {{of organic matter}} and carbonate in many epicontinental nd oceanic sections of the Atlantic-Tethyan realm. Some of the studied epicontinental sections contain an excursion in the manganese content of carbonates coincident with the shift in carbon isotopic values. In a key reference section at Pueblo, Colorado, the stratigraphic position and magnitude of the manganese excursion are described {{with respect to the}} carbon isotopic excursion. Coincident excursions in manganese contents and carbon isotopic values are verified for a section in Normandy, France. The depositional setting for these two sections is persistently to intermittently well oxygenated with the accumulation ofinterbcdded chalky and marly sediments. No shift in manganese values was detected through the isotopic excursion in a section from northern Nebraska, where fossils are preserved only as bedding-plane impressions due to extensive arly diagenetic dissolution of carbonate. The carbon-isotopic and manganese excursions begin at the same stratlgraphic position, but manganese contents return to back-ground values within {{the lower half of the}} carbon-isotopic excursion. The relative timing and duration of these signals suggest the existence of a large manganese r servoir that was rapidly mobilized. Transfer of manganese from deep-sea oxides (Mn *+) to epieontinental carbonates (Mn 2 +) is inferred to have occurred uring expansion of oceanic oxygen-minimum zones with associated changes in redox gradients and boundaries. Simultaneous excursions in carbon isotopic values and manganese contents can occur at sites of carbonate accumulation when the carbon and manganese cycles are linked through the reducing potential of widesprea...|$|R
40|$|Large {{variations}} {{exist between}} published mid-Cretaceous (late Barremian to early <b>Turonian</b> <b>stages)</b> seawater Sr-isotope stratigraphies; this {{has resulted in}} disparate interpretations of crustal production rates. We report on a detailed investigation of seawater Sr-isotope stratigraphy based on foraminifers and, where available, on inoceramid bivalves from 12 mid-Cretaceous Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean Drilling Program sections. The effects of diagenesis are assessed using scanning electron microscope observations and trace-elemental analyses, but are best distinguished by comparing the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of similar-age samples from different sites. Strontium-isotope analyses compiled from 9 of 12 sites that have detailed age control define one band of common values. This band {{is used as a}} composite curve, which presumably represents seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values. The composite curve shows a "trough" of markedly lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values in the Aptian and early Albian stages, higher but constant values for the middle Albian-Cenomanian stages, followed by a decrease in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values in the early Turonian. Variations between published mid-Cretaceous Sr-isotope records result from diagenetic alteration, analytical problems, and the diverse biostratigraphic approaches and assumptions used to estimate sample ages. When preexisting age data are made consistent, the composite record shows close similarities with data sets derived from measurements of macrofossils in land sections of Europe and North America. The interval of decreased 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values in the Aptian-Albian stages overlaps with the pulse of mid-plate volcanic activity that produced the Ontong Java, Manihiki, and Kerguelen Plateaus. The exact age and the shape of the trough, however, are consistent with increased spreading rates at oceanic ridges, given the existing data on the timing of mid-plate volcanic activity...|$|R
