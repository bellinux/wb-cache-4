After breaching an insurgent perimeter, Specialist Four Erevia was designated by his platoon leader to render first aid to several casualties, and the rest of the platoon moved forward. As he was doing so, he came under intense hostile fire from four bunkers to his left front. Although he could have taken cover with the rest of the element, he chose a retaliatory course of action. With heavy enemy fire directed at him, he moved in full view of the hostile gunners as he proceeded to crawl from one wounded man to another, gathering ammunition. Armed with two M-16 rifles and several hand grenades, he charged toward the enemy positions behind the suppressive fire of the two rifles. Under very intense fire, he continued to advance on the insurgents until he was near the first bunker. Disregarding the enemy fire, he pulled the pin from a hand grenade and advanced on the bunker, leveling suppressive fire until he could drop the grenade into the bunker, mortally wounding the insurgent and destroying the fortification. Without hesitation, he employed identical tactics as he proceeded to eliminate the next two enemy positions. With the destruction of the third bunker, Specialist Four Erevia had exhausted his supply of hand grenades. Still under intense fire from the fourth position, he courageously charged forward behind <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>emitted</b> by his M-16 rifles. Arriving at the very edge of the bunker, he silenced the occupant within the fortification at point blank range. Through his heroic actions the lives of the wounded were saved and the members of the Company Command Post were relieved from a very precarious situation. His exemplary performance in the face of overwhelming danger was an inspiration to his entire company and contributed immeasurably to the success of the mission. Specialist Four Erevia’s conspicuous gallantry, extraordinary heroism, and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty, were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.Citation represents Soldier's rank at time of action.|$|E

In the present day, wildfire enhances surface O 3 by 2  ppbv (7  %) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550  nm by 0. 03 (26  %) in the summer. By mid-century, area burned is predicted to increase by 66  % in boreal North America, contributing more O 3 (13  %) and aerosols (37  %). Fire O 3 causes negligible impacts on NPP because ambient O 3 concentration (with fire contributions) is below the damage threshold of 40  ppbv for 90  % summer days. Fire aerosols reduce surface solar radiation but enhance atmospheric absorption, resulting in enhanced air stability and intensified regional drought. The domain of this drying is confined to the north in the present day but extends southward by 2050 due to increased fire emissions. Consequently, wildfire aerosols enhance NPP by 72  Tg C yr − 1 in the present day but decrease NPP by 118  Tg C yr − 1 in the future, mainly because of the soil moisture perturbations. Our results suggest that future wildfire may accelerate boreal carbon loss, not only through direct emissions increasing from 68  Tg C yr − 1 at present day to 130  Tg C yr − 1 by mid-century but also through the biophysical impacts of fire aerosols...|$|R

It continues: [...] "The center of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> looked like glowing metal, and in <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was {{what looked like}} four living creatures". These creatures are described as winged and humanoid, they [...] "sped {{back and forth like}} flashes of lightning" [...] and [...] "fire moved back and forth among the creatures". The passage goes on to describe four shiny objects, each appearing [...] "like a wheel intersecting a wheel". These objects could fly and they moved with the creatures: [...] "When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose".|$|R

Developed for use in testing optoelectronic hydrogen-fire detectors, which respond to ultraviolet light at wavelengths from 180 to 240 nanometers. Wavelength range unique in that within it, hydrogen <b>fires</b> <b>emit</b> small but detectable amounts of radiation, light from incandescent lamps and Sun almost completely absent, and air sufficiently transmissive to enable detection of hydrogen fire from distance. Consequently, this spectral region favorable for detecting hydrogen fires while minimizing false alarms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVegetation <b>fires</b> <b>emit</b> {{large amount}} of gases and {{aerosols}} which are detrimental to human health. Smoke exposure near and downwind of <b>fires</b> depends on <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> propagation, <b>the</b> atmospheric circulations and the burnt vegetation. A better knowledge {{of the interaction between}} wildfire and atmosphere is a primary requirement to investigate fire smoke and particle transport. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight the usefulness of an UV scanning lidar to characterise <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> smoke plume and consequently validate fire-atmosphere model simulations. An instrumented burn was conducted in a Mediterranean area typical of ones frequently subject to wildfire with low dense shrubs. Using lidar measurements positioned near <b>the</b> experimental site, <b>fire</b> smoke plume was thoroughly characterised by its optical properties, edge and dynamics. These parameters were obtained by combining methods based on lidar inversion technique, wavelet edge detection and a backscatter barycentre technique. The smoke plume displacement was determined using a digital video camera coupled with the lidar. The simulation was performed using a mesoscale atmospheric model in a large eddy simulation configuration (Meso-NH) coupled to a fire propagation physical model (ForeFire), taking into account the effect of wind, slope and fuel properties. A passive numerical scalar tracer was injected in <b>the</b> model at <b>fire</b> location to mimic the smoke plume. <b>The</b> simulated <b>fire</b> smoke plume width remained within the edge smoke plume obtained from lidar measurements. The maximum smoke injection derived from lidar backscatter coefficients and the simulated passive tracer was around 200 m. The vertical position of the simulated plume barycentre was systematically below the barycentre derived from the lidar backscatter coefficients due to the oversimplified properties of the passive tracer compared to real aerosol particles. Simulated speed and horizontal location of the plume compared well with the observations derived from the videography and lidar method, suggesting that fire convection and advection were correctly taken into account...|$|R
